Criminalization provides gangs, cartels and dealers with billions of dollars, increases violence as they fight for control of territory, lead to many more overdoses which drains health care, fills prisons with people suffering from addictions and create a road block for scientific research.   Legalization would take a lot of power and money out of the hands of criminal organizations, lead to an increase in research, provide consistant quality and consistency and take away the stigma of treatment and fear of prison for those that want help.   We should have learned our lesson with prohibition.  It's a step in the right direction. The war on drugs is an abject failure. It enriches criminals, stigmatizes the sick, ruins lives, and cost way too much. I'd really like to see this happen as a pilot project in a province in Canada or state in the US.  I'd don't want it out in public, perhaps a small fine for being irresponsible, similar to a drunk in public charge.  All of the consequences of irresponsible drug use are already illegal. It may take a generation or two, but I wouldn't be surprised if drug use dropped across the board after a generation or two. As someone who works in DTES Vancouver primarily at insite, legalising drugs would be a huge step forward in recovery and general safety of addicts and recreational users as a whole. It would take pressure off of emergency services allowing them to help the community more, allowing it to be taxed would allow larger budgets in emergency services and recovery programs. I see few downsides for legalisation and truly believe it would help save thousands of people.  At the least they should be decriminalized and no plants should ever be made illegal. Prohibition doesn't work, has never worked, and will never work. Fundamentally this is a question of ownership. Either the individual owns their body or the State, politicians, and bureaucrats do.  No way guys lets wait until something 100x worse than fentanyl or bath salts comes along, that will really stop people from using drugs! /s Possession and personal use of all drugs should be legalized.   I also personally believe that they should be legal to manufacture and sell under regulation.  You aren't going to get people to stop from making drugs and consuming them.  Its not a realistic goal.  You cant say ""Dont do meth!""  Well people can make it in their basement.  You cant uninvent it.   So you either have people making it in their basement and drug cartels running the distribution, or you can have it made by regulations for maximum safety and control it. This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/erskine-smith-decriminalize-all-drugs-1.3958336) reduced by 83%.

The drug war has long been lost, the prisons are full of people who will never be able to get a job. The cost to the US has been huge, and far worse than any social costs of legalization.   Legalizing drugs will permit the government to regulate the quality. that would end horrible overdoses and people dying from bad drugs.     It would take the profit motive out of drugs, so pushers would have no reason to try and hook people. It would raise lots of tax money for legal sellers and create jobs. It would stop police from taking bribes from dealers. it would stop judges from bribes. It would take all the drug cases out of the judicial system. it would slash prison inmates.     what I don't get in these kind of topics which pops up every other day is why are all the upvoted comments using countries that successfully legalized drugs as the be all end all proof banning drugs doesn't work? Sure some countries was able to do that, other countries also failed miserably, England tried it in the 70s which lead to a massive increase in its Teenage heroin usage. not to mention many countries in Asia like China and Singapore have very successfully won their war on drugs and have much less drug usage than the European countries that legalized it. Hell due to colonialism half of China was addicted to Opium at up to the early 1900s and after extreme enforcement 50 years later you can't even find anything harder than a cigarette. Thats pretty fucking successful in my books, I doubt legalizing Opium was gonna get 100 million Chinese addicts off the stuff  Legalizing drugs have worked for some, doesn't mean it'll work for everybody and definitely doesn't mean its the best and only option Decriminalize it first  I'm all for decriminalization, but in my opinion certain drugs should not be legalized. Legalization would mean that a drug like fentanyl could be legally sold for recreational purposes, and I think that would increase social problems related to fentanyl rather than decrease such problems. But again, I'm all for decriminalization so that users and addicts aren't treated like criminals, but rather as people with a health problem. If Trudeau legalizes marijuana in April, like he promised, my vote will be cemented. If this is on the docket for the next election, I will fight to convince my friends that it is a worthwhile endeavour. Would be good for the whole world. Drug laws have killed hundreds of thousands. i've been saying this since they first taught me about drugs in junior high.  Legalize it, and require people to have a license, that shows they understand the consequences, to purchase any drugs Well yes, what he wants is to make drugs a health issue instead of a criminal issue. Thats reasonable. Enforcement has failed, miserably, and undeniably   Decriminalization is also not the same as legalization. Its removing penalties for use and possession for personal use.  Legalizing drugs is basically regulating the already existing black market Worth mentioning former Toronto mayor Rob Ford was hardcore addicted to cocaine and actually died last year. This shouldn't be a controversial position. legalize weed first We now know who loves his drugs. Rob? Is that you? I think he is absolutely on the money would be great for this country and Mexico as well. not only would it stop the war on drugs, but a lot of illegal drugs particularly psychedelics are almost silver bullet like in their effect on mental health disorders like addiction and depression in combination with professional therapy  that one move would have so many positive reverberations its almost hard to fathom. lets stop fucking around and pull the trigger on this also according to common sense, science, and logic. My hope is that Trump pisses off Canada and Mexico enough that Canada and Mexico legalize all drugs. One of the reasons those countries do not, is because of Americans influence. It would put so much pressure on America. I think we need to legalize prostitution just to control STDs and provide legal protection for people in the sex industry. Well legalizing non-white powder drugs would be good.  Hamsterdam!! Having been a heroin user for ten years, arrested 17 times and sent to prison twice, I agree whole-heartedly with legalization. I am 27 years old and every charge was a drug charge for possession or sales, except for one for petit larceny. I have been targeted and oppressed for my urge to use drugs. I am not a bad person and I do not think it wrong to use drugs. Our drug policy needs to change asap.  They could call it the Rob Ford Act. Of course it would be, literally every single study of drug legalization comes to that same conclusion. In a time when our southern neighbor is losing liberties, one thing we can do is keep progressing with our liberties and enshrining them in law. All these fucking retarded thug-gangster wannabees would have to actually work for a living :_( Honestly, yeah, legalize it, and if people break crimes whilst under the influence, rain justice on them, but if they're being high at home or something, let them be, if they overdose, well, that's their own fault. I'll pitch in Fentanyl for everyone. I don't completely agree. Legalizing and regulating the herbs, tinctures and flowers that make up the drugs is one thing...opium, booze, weed and coca leaf are drastically different than cocaine and heroin and oxy.  It worked for Portugal I don't that see why it couldn't work for Canada. How would opening the flood gates to incredibly addictive medications be good for anyone?  Opiods are already a problem, why do we need cheaper versions of them available legally?  Who benefits from having unlimited access to heroin, meth and coke? So this MP's name is Toronto as well, so confusing.  This wont happen anytime soon in the US sadly with religious lobbyists, police union lobbyists, prison guard union lobbyists, pharma lobbyists, alcohol lobbyists, and probably even drug cartel lobbyists all against that hurt their business. Legalizing all drugs would be good for both  and . Portugal has shown us it's the right thing to do. I don't like the thought of 15 year olds asking 18 year olds to buy them heroine for a house party.   I think marijuana would be a good test drug to see how widespread use would become among adolescents. Legalize all drugs?! Even meth and heroine and the like?! Sounds horrible... Huh you can only get heroin in Switzerland under government supervision and only under very limited conditions, it is not as if you can just get them in a corner store, not exactly legalisation if you ask me. As my gurl Breadqwuanda says ""mmmmhhhmmmm I am FEELIN DAT!"" Could we name it after Mayor Ford?  Rob Ford would be proud  Since Americans already legalized pot in some states, we need to 1-up them somehow after we legalize weed. I would be good for the world. Legalizing all drugs in Colorado would only reduce arrests by 3.1%  Over 50% of police work is traffic violations.  *Sorts by controversial* Time to get comfy boys Funny because this should be the *conservative* pov Videos in this thread: [Watch Playlist &#9654;](http://subtletv.com/_r5rbsxo?feature=playlist)  VIDEO|COMMENT -|- [Oreos More Addictive Than Cocain? -- Dr  Pam Peeke at TEDxWallStreet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTIq0jnUnCg)|[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5rbsxo/_/dd6230y?context=10#dd6230y) - sugar.. man I hope Big sugar doesn't put me on a watchlist after posting this comment  Oreos More Addictive Than Cocaine? -- Dr Pam Peeke at TEDxWallStreet  Big Sugars Secret Ally?

LOL [The Onion had it right all along](https://www.google.ca/amp/www.theonion.com/amp/110) if you ask me. Nice try, Rob Ford... Follow Portugal's lead...take the $ away from criminals and gangs ands prison industry. Who wouldn't it be good for really? Too much of a logical choice to ever happen. Washington needs Ottawa to help enforce the drug war for the sake of profit. Absolutely fucking right.  Yes but what about all the money our prison systems make.  This is dumb as it would make it possible to get drugs.. Oh wait I already can. This is dumb as cartels would lose out on trillions. Oh wait this good. Uh.. The only negative I can find is that it would hurt the police.. Oh wait they can focus on dangerous drivers, rapes, murders and thefts which is good.  Ok, why haven't we done this yet? Oh yah, politics is about the suppression of the population and moral projection. Ok, carry on. Legalise all drugs. Follow countries that have had the success.  It would be good for pretty much anywhere. Look at Portugal. They legalized everything, and saw nothing but benefits: less addiction, less overdoses/hospitalizations, less crime in general.  We already know the consequences of prohibition, because we tried it with booze, killed a bunch of people as a result, and created the mob. Why are we repeating that mistake? Question about legalizing vs decriminalizing:  Legalizing would open the door to allow it things like over the counter Advil-Morphine, and allow Coca-Cola to have cocaine in it again..correct?  Versus decriminalizing it, where as.. Its still not legal to sell but if you get caught with it on you, no one judges you for it? this would be a valid argument if we didn't have universal health care. I don't want to pay for someone else's drug-induced health issues.  Just do it! ""Panem et circenses ""  Typical neoliberal solution. This would go for the US as well.  Or what's left of it after Trump/Bannon annihilate the union. This only sounds good to hippie liberals. Where would you like your local drug store to go? I sure as hell would not want it in the neighborhood where I raise my children. Drugs are outlawed because they are bad for you.  Guys can you please tell me - have you and your friends increase the using of a drugs with legalise?   Sorry for my English, I live in Russia and we are far from legalizing even weed. But as I was told - the usage of drugs increase when it's allowed to buy whenever you want. I just want to know the real expierence.  Am from Portugal.  You'll not go to jail for it, bit if you're caught in possession of it, you're required to attend a dissuassion apointment, for example. You might be taken to the local post during the procedure.  Hash and marijuana are dealt inside and outsider of most highschools. Lots of youngsters smoke.   I do not think that decriminalizing it helps in any way, it's just a way of not having to deal with this matter, basically saying ""this is a problem but let's pretend its' not"". Prohibition and the war on drugs provide artificial price supports to products that are essentially intrinsically worthless. I forget the exact number, but a kilo of cocaine costs less than a thousand dollars to manufacture.  Did it in Portugal, but at least Canada would have the means of helping its people even more.   > *Letting people do more stuff without restrictions is good*. - Any random liberal I've been using heroin for 10 years at will already my friend. That's kind of the point. Then do it already.  I am currently on suboxone. A combination of bupenorphine and naloxone. Which is an opioid and an opiate blocker. I am on suboxone as the needle exchange near me has begun prescribing it in a test run to 30 people. No groups are required, no shaming, no nonsense. Which has had huge implications on my life! It's why I'm sitting here able to type to you now. So opioids are legal now with a prescription. I don't see much of a jump to legalizing heroin at least not as far as the effects it would have on me being the user of said drug... I live in a town called ithaca where the mayor has proposed having a safe injection site. The needle exchange (southern tiers aids prevention point) arranged for me to go to detox 4 months ago and  I haven't used heroin for 3 months. I am living proof harm reduction works. So yes I think if the u.s or Canada normalizes and legalizes the use of drugs then those that have a problem are more likely to fix their problems. While I am all for a different type of system for dealing with addictions (more rehabilitive), there are a few reasons I don't see this as a great solution.   1) Black markets. Even if we legalize all drugs and make them available, the cost is likely to be outrageous and I am sure some form of black markets will exist, which kind of nulls the argument of safety.   2) The pure danger level of some of these drugs (see carfentanil, and I would put crystal meth in this category as well) is so high that there simply is no way to make these drugs safe. And the risk of harm to oneself and others by using them is simply too high for us to normalize them.  3) I know this won't be a popular argument, but I think for some of the addicts I have known and talked to, there is something to be said for needing to have some form of a consequence in order to objectively look at their actions and decide they need to find help and get better. While I absolutely see addiction as a mental illness, I do not think we can or should make drug use consequence free, especially considering drug addicts are not the only ones hurt by their drug use.   4) This one is personal. As I said above, addicts are not the only ones hurt by their drug use. I work frequently with babies withdrawing from drugs. Withdrawal in infants is heartbreaking. These kids suffer. I cannot imagine if this was legalized. I do not judge these parents for their drug use, as I know it's not within their control at this point. However they often are simply too ill with their addiction to care for an infant. They are also often too ill to see that. It is heartbreaking, but it is the reality of the situation. It is already such a fight to make sure these babies are going to go to a stable home. Legalizing street drugs would make that fight even harder. Addicts are not the only victims of drug use. We cannot allow it to simply become normal. Someone needs to stand up and advocate for the victims who cannot do it for themselves. Is Canada accepting migrants? Willing to study in STEM field. I think in this country right now given the current world situation we have far more important things to worry about  legalising drugs is a smoke screen to distract us from our real problems  Kids these days are genuine coke heads... so lets make it easier for them to be addicts? What a time to be alive when the most pressing problem for people is how to get high. I suppose this is a good way of natural selection. yeah, free access to opium would greatly benefit society Yes, the world would be such a better place if we had more drugs, that way we can all be useless, soul-sucking junkies. You know who says this shit!? People who've never had to bury someone because of overdose or had to deal with the psychotic episode of meth or crack. I'm all for legalizing pot, but meth or crack? NO FUCKING WAY! drugs should not be legal - they literally can destroy entire societies  however if theres a crackhead and they are fully in private its better to just leave them alone - theres no hope for them, but if they affect others then you can implement the law The people that think all drugs should be legal have never been around someone with a meth or heroin addiction. Coming from personal experience that shit is the devil and it ruins lives and breaks apart families. I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy.  I think weed definitely needs to become legal but highly addictive drugs that end up causing people to steal and assault people for a fix probably should stay illegal. Better to throw them in jail and have them detox off the drug then wait for them to bash someones head open.  If Tobacco & Alcohol were illegal today and knowing the harm they can do to people, would any government propose legalising them. NO.   So why the hell would any responsible government propose legalising Heroin and Crack Cocaine.    Nice try Rob Ford.  Rob Ford would be so proud I don't know anyone who grew opium, who turned it into heroin, who cut it, who shipped it, who cut it again and again, who then distributed impure and unpredictable amounts of heroin at a high price to hard working Americans.  Neither do I know any conceivable way to stop humans from using drugs. (I was in the box for 104 days in nysdoc midtsate shu-200 and locked down 24/7. Even there I still was able to get drugs through the slit in the bottom of a door with a string from a blanket, a shampoo packet and a staple)  What I do know is there's a better way. What I do know is my best friends did not deserve to die unintentionally from a drug that they had very little to do with it's creation or distribution. I know my life has been ruined by our current drug policy. I know my friends are dead because the government refuses to make drug use a safe and legal option.   It's hard to imagine that all this pain has been caused by our drug policy. That some kids mother has to accept there son is dead because our government won't back down from ignorant policies. But that mother knows her kid was a good kid, and there's a lot of mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, and friends now who have seen someone they love die despite that persons best efforts. Maybe no more good kids have to die on the streets because of bad policy. Maybe we can finally change this stupid policy. How to ruin families and lives by Liberals 101. No it wouldn't, you idiot! a Heroin vacation in Canada sounds nice. Criminalisation:  * Provides money to gangs and criminals to continue funding criminal activity  * Is a huge drain on police services  * Is a huge burden on prison services  * Allows, unrestricted easy access to drugs regardless of age, health, etc  * Allows tainted, highly toxic chemicals to be mixed in with drugs endangering lives * Stigmatises adicts  * Has 80 years of evidence backing up the fact it is not an effective way of tackling the problem.   Legalisation:  * Takes money away from criminals, allowing it to be retained in the community and funnelled it into:  * Social infrastructure projects to improve the lives of those most susceptible to drugs addiction, perhaps preventing it  * Investment in education, providing kids an alternative future than being an addict  * Investment in rehab allowing those seeking help to get the best possible help  * Allows for easier health monitoring of addicts  * Having access to addicts will make it easier to provide rehab * Allows for access to clean, safer drugs * If a prescription style service is provided it may:  * Prevent people moving to harder drugs ""on a whim""  * Could allow for better controls based on age * Releases a huge burden from police allowing them to tackle proper crimes and have a much more significant impact on our society * Would empty prisons overnight.  It's not a perfect solution, but it's a hell of a lot better than the present policies.   EDIT: to be clear, I'm suggesting a perscription type service where it would not be illegal to get drugs on a prescription and getting them as such would totally legal and cost the same as on the street, but street selling drugs would land you with very stiff penalties and would not be tolerated by the law. So, if you want to take drugs, fine... Go to your doctor, request a prescription, go to you local drug outlet and get and take your legal drugs. But, if you are caught buying or selling them on the street illegally then you are going to have the full force of the law come down on you and face serious jail time. There simply wouldn't be any benefit to anyone taking drugs illegally. As Blue Scholars has said ""the more things outlawed the more outlaws run"". Tommy Chong by them is the song. They're really down to earth. Agreed ""medicalize them all""  The war on drugs is over - we have to use reality on the ground and figure out what we want as a society and how to get there.   Too bad I can't upvote your comment more than once. You hit the nail right on the head imagine how boring shows like ""drugs inc"" would be if drugs were legal. Except gangs, cartels and dealers would still get money from this, they would just be getting a legal source of revenue now.  The coca leaf only comes from one part of the world, Latin America.  There is an international trade ban on the substance.  To get it to Canada requires a black market.  Our hospitals already can't handle the influx of drug clients.  Nursing is considered to be the most dangerous job in Canada specifically because of how many assaults they get.  If you legalize drugs that means police aren't bringing people with drug addictions to the hospitals and are not providing protection for hospital staff.  The system is already pushed to the limits.  Unfortunately due to the way Canadians prosecute laws legalizing all drugs doesn't actually reduce a need for crime enforcement.  Police leave casual users of the vast majority of substances alone and only arrest them if they are guilty of some other crime (assault, battery, theft, etc).  Legalization opens a can of worms that the provincial systems do not have the funding to deal with. I understand the benefits that you stated in regards to legalizing all drugs, however i'd like to provide a counterargument to it.    Some drugs I personally feel should never be legalized.  I'll stick to the one that I feel most strongly about which is opioids.  They are highly addictive, they are responsible for the greatest amount of deaths via overdoses in North America and the problem is incredibly rampant.  I should also add that these problems are not usually the result of drugs obtained illegally.  It usually begins through prescription pain medications which in itself is a whole other issue to be discussed.    My issue with legalizing all drugs is that certain substances should never be easily accessed by the public...ever.  Regulations are put into place because a lot of these drugs are dangerous and the potential for lives to be destroyed is very real.  I have no doubt in my mind that if opiods were available to be purchased at your local pharmacy without regulations in place, the opioid crisis that we're already experiencing would skyrocket astronomically.     The issue with drug legalization is too complex to simply state all drugs should be legalized.  They should be discussed at an individual level and the impacts for each substance should be analyzed on its own.    Came here to say this. Do it. You will see abuse rates actually fall. You will see Carfentanil disappear.  It may seem paradoxical, but despite what is going on elsewhere in the world right now, we need to *mature* our society here in Canada. We need to assist Trudeau (or whomever may replace him) in pressing this country forward on every progressive front we can.  We have a liberal majority. If we fuck this up now, we may not get another chance. We have to divest from oil and transition to sustainable energy. We need to ensure unfounded xenophobia remains at least underfoot. But most importantly...  **BLOCKCHAIN** This is the future we need. Publicly funded and available databases of scientific research, protected and self-archived and referenced via blockchain. We will not let another Con-Man silence our science ever again!  This technology can be implemented across so many fronts. If you ever doubted whether or not society might be able to TRANSITION to a more Libertarian and Decentralized state, BLOCKCHAIN is the MEANS!  These technologies will eradicate so much of the deception that plagues politics and economics in general. Imagine a day where you could vote anonymously via blockchain, that vote could be assured with greater security than any method currently in employment today.  But wait, there's MORE!  Don't like how the government spends your tax dollars? Well with BLOCKCHAIN you could distribute your requisite taxes (or a portion thereof) how you deem fit, aside from just keeping that money in your pocket that is ;)  Your vote via BLOCKCHAIN wouldn't just be a vote for the lesser of two evils. You would vote on the issues, and the governing body would be but subservient to the PEOPLE, as intended, to ensure that we are not caught funneling money into the pockets of corporations.  Right. Corporations. Last point and I say it with disdain despite a career in the telecommunications industry. Fuck you Bell, Rogers, and Telus. We're going to build our own fucking infrastructure and lock it OPEN FOR EVERYONE to use.   You realize that 10 years ago Portugal did this and funnelled some of the money that went through courts and policing into rehab and now has gone from a country which had one of the higher percentage of drug users to one of the lowest.  Hell TIME magazine did a massive article on it years ago. Source http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1893946,00.html  Give free drugs to known addicts and  disrupt the bad Cycle and criminals businesss model. It's almost like for the last 16 years we needed someone in office who could actually get shit done here at home instead bombing people in the middle East. > pilot project in a province in Canada  Our drug laws are federal, not provincial. What does scientific fact matter though, if our leaders have already proclaimed they will stick to dogma rather than scientifically proven results?  Current govt. here in Belgium reversed the previous govt.'s lax policies concerning softdrugs without explanation (besides that it was one of their points) and has already declared to want to go much further. If you legalize in just one province, people will produce drugs in the province where they are legal and sell where they are illegal. With no border control between provinces, it would result in an unchecked flow of unregulated black market drugs into the other provinces.  This must be done nationwide or not at all. Do you think that perhaps tax paying retail outlets with strict lab testing (in house/external) could be a thing?   What about deadly, deadly poisons with no medical use?   I mean, outside of assisted suicide   Legal coke/heroine is going to be a challenge but damn, I just got news this afternoon about a woman who died from fentanyl.  She was going through a (another?) rough spot, turned to heroine laced with fentanyl, and died.    These aren't crime obsessed homeless junkies, just people with problems.  Hell, she had an OK job and children. (I know the daughter and her X which is why they called me; to cry)  If we could remove the stigma and provide a less lethal alternative to ""self medication"" that would be great.  Use any 'profit' to ramp up the war on the psychopaths currently mixing up their own fentanyl laced goods.  >End rant.    I think the mp is related to Dr. Abraham Erskine. What if companies start to R&D drugs? They will have an huge amount of money and can make better and better drugs. certainly better than the black market. Do it slowly and responsibly. Have special medical officials be the only ones that can provide it, but not before giving a consultation before every purchase. > You cant say ""Dont do meth!"" Well people can make it in their basement. You cant uninvent it. So you either have people making it in their basement and drug cartels running the distribution, **or you can have it made by regulations for maximum safety and control it**.  Regulations won't remedy the problems surrounding meth.  The problem with meth is that it's addictive and it disrupts sleep. The drug itself doesn't cause a whole lot of direct harm to users, provided they don't overdose on it, so there isn't much room for improvement with manufacturing regulations. But users can sometimes go for a month or so without sleeping if they're using regularly, and the sleep deprivation causes a whole host of physical and mental problems that can be permanent. And it's not an isolated example either, there's other drugs that wouldn't become safer through manufacturing regulation, such as fentanyl. Yea enabling drug addiction is a terrible idea. ""People are going to do it anyway"" is a terrible justification. I can vouch for this, I have a close friend from the Philippines who works here and trying to explain it to him almost made *my* head explode. This is painfully idealistic.   > governmet can regulate the quality > it would take the profit motive out of drugs  You can't have both. High quality drugs regulated by a government are not cheap. This would increase the 'profit motive' for dealers to step on (dilute) their products and sell it more affordably.   > that would end horrible overdoses  High quality, high purity narcotics are not going to solve overdoses. It can help people keep from killing themselves by accidentally taking the wrong drugs, since you know what you're buying, but too much of a high purity narcotic will cause you to OD.    >It would raise lots of tax money for legal sellers and create jobs.   Much of that tax money would go into rehabilitation, or at least it should.   > It would stop police from taking bribes from dealers.   Wut.   > it would stop judges from bribes.   Wut.   > It would take all the drug cases out of the judicial system.   No it wouldn't. ""All the drug cases"" are you kidding? Intent to distribute, manufacturing, importing, exporting.  None of those things would be legal without proper licensing and approvals from the regulators. Lots of people would break those rules. There would be plenty of drug cases in court.  I think you're looking at it the wrong way.   It's not that ""legalisation works for some and not for others"", but rather that the methods used to regulate the trade might need to be tweaked depending on which country you are in.   For exampe, maybe in England they should have put stricter regulations on how much heroin you could buy, or they should have invested more in treating heroin addicts than they did.  By the way do you have a source for England trying legalisation iin the 70s? I can't seem to find anything I disagree.    The 'hard' drugs will need rigorous production standards, lab testing, controlled storage and transportation, ... an entire drug industry.  A legal system would truly have to compete against the already existing one.  And we can't use slave labour, violence, or addiction to keep production costs  low.  Fuck I hate seeing people die.  I have not thought of nor seen a solution either.  Fuck. The popularity of fentanyl is likely a result of the drug war.  See [Iron Law of Prohibition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_law_of_prohibition)  >When drugs or alcohol are prohibited, they will be produced in black markets in more concentrated and powerful forms, because these more potent forms offer better efficiency in the business modelthey take up less space in storage, less weight in transportation, and they sell for more money. Economist Mark Thornton writes that the iron law of prohibition undermines the argument in favor of prohibition, because the higher potency forms are less safe for the consumer.  and  >The popular shift from beer to wine to hard liquor during the US Prohibition era[6] has a parallel in the narcotics trade in the late 20th century. Bulky opium was illegal, so refined heroin became more prevalent, albeit with significant risk from blood-borne disease because of injection by needle, and far greater risk of death from overdose. Marijuana was also found too bulky and troublesome to smuggle across borders, so smugglers turned to refined cocaine with its much higher potency and profit per pound.[7] Cowan wrote in 1986 that crack cocaine was entirely a product of the prohibition of drugs.[2] Clinical psychiatrist Michael J. Reznicek adds crystal meth to this list. I believe that legalizing such drugs would be of enormous benefit on this regard. Not all drugs have to be controlled the same way; but leaving the opiate sales to the black market isn't going to help harm reduction. It makes it difficult for us to have accurate data/statistics on the issue, the products are not controlled, the users are unaware of what they buy, organized crime still gets the money, etc.  This is however subject to debate. I think that most can agree that it's important to move forward on the legalization of softer drugs. The legal status of drugs of higher epidemiological properties must be carefully planned, and it should not slow down the legalization of other drugs. Legalization of alcohol did not increase the societal problems related to alcohol. No other drug will be different.  >decriminalization  Legalized demand but illegal supply is worse, not better.  Legalization. Regulation. These fix these problems. So here's the thing. Knee jerk I want to agree. There's some real life messing drugs that'll kill you within years if not sooner.   But logically they shouldn't be illegal just regulated strictly. You shouldn't be punished for posesssing, nor using drugs especially when it affects no one else.   The people who get into the heavy drugs like heroin or morphine addiction need help, and to be weened off in a controlled manner.   Prison doesn't help them. And it doesn't stop them. Legalizecand regulate. Give the people that need help, the help they need.   If people still want to inject heroin until they die, they should be able to do that. Life sucks like that. Treating them like they're on the same level as a thief or a murderer is only showing them they were right and no one cares about them. Show them kindness. That life isn't that bad without drugs and you may give them the hope they do not have.  But people who really want fentanyl can already get it, so I don't understand your argument. All legalization would do is take away the violence and money away from cartels, and make it so people can get help easier. Decriminalizing is a half measure which still empowers the cartels, trafficking and violence. Legalizing is what kills trillions in profits for the evil cartels.  Even if we did go with decriminalizing, you can't guarantee the quality of the drug. So someone looking for heroin might get fentanyl by mistake and die.  There's very little logic behind the arguments for decriminalization unless your irrationally scared or in support of cartels, which you might be. **There will be some number of us in this forum whose lives are benefited from the illegal drug trade and will be defending it.**  What does having a drug be illegal achieve? I suspect that ""recreational"" use of fentanyl would be, cough, fine if the consumer knew WTF they where consuming.    The concentrations/potency of this drug are only getting higher to make it easier to smuggle. And sooo much harder to safely mix in a bucket in your bath tub.   He has a majority and four and half years left. We have seen what Trump gets done in a week. If Trudeau can't get this done in his first term, what makes you think he would do it a second? This is not part of the Liberal platform in any way. This is just one Liberal MP's isolated opinion. I haven't heard of any kind of support for broader reform from the Liberals, and I suspect they won't touch it until Marijuana's done and over with. I personally don't think we'll get any more large drug reform laws passed for the rest of the 4 years the Liberals have. Maybe next time if they happen to win again.  Just a heads up, no one ever said marijuana will be legal in Spring. They said they will put the legislation through in the spring. It may be at least another year until you can actually go out and buy from a store. Please don't be one of those ""he promised us it will be legal on 4/20!"" people. I have enough of a headache trying to explain this to my friends. Hmm, cementing your election choice based off of one sole platform promise?  Seems smart.  And if you haven't already seen it in the cards yet, Trudeau won't be getting it done this term, but will instead dangle it in front of voters like yourself for the next election. Blaming the opposition for not allowing it to happen yet, of course, even though they hold a majority.  No, that would be millions or tens of millions. Who do you want profiting?  Criminals, or government criminals? Medias play a big role in controversies. People have get their opinion somewhere if they don't research themselves. Anything is controversial when your job depends on it being so. Think of all the votes politicians get by demonizing terrorists, sex offenders and drug users. Please do. Once the Mexico one gets up too, we'll see if the rest of the world will pitch in for a lid Build one east and west then we can just keep all the Americans IN.  everyone that's done drugs.. (alcohol, tobacco, weed, legal highs?) Drugs are awesome when used responsibly. I actually think the Queen is on our money. Would you work on quitting if it were legalized?  In world where drugs were legalised, I don't think anyone would want any fentanyl.   It's a poor and dangerous substitute for heroin.   Heroin addicts take it because it's cheaper and dealers can get their hands on it more easily as, being much more potent, its much easier to smuggle.  Heroin cost pence to produce but is expensive to buy because it's illegal, were it fully legal it would probably cost as much as Aspirin. Yea but does keeping them illegal actually help anyone apart from drug dealers? coca leaf is as much of a drug as coffee or tea Drugs were decriminalized in Portugal, not legalized. There's a significant difference. In Portugal drugs aren't legal, they are decriminalized, you can't sell or produce them. You can use them and carry a certain quantity legally and you'll be viewed as a drug user who needs treatment by the law and the health services  Legalizing drugs has many advantages.  Currently, drugs are sold by the black market. This means that one can dilute the drugs at an unknown concentration (which is the main cause of overdoses), mix them with other drugs (sometimes stronger) and chemicals, sell to minors or anyone regardless of their mental state, etc. Meanwhile, they pay no taxes and have no norm to conform to; which means that they can use any pesticide, store and transport drugs the way they want, conduct no quality control, market the drugs how they want etc.  All of these factors makes drugs extremely profitable, and all this profit is funneled to organized crime. Meanwhile, we are wasting time and money with police/court/prisons, we have trouble conducting research on drugs, we have inaccurate data on drug use and addicts don't get the help they need.  Of course, though, you can't put all drugs in the same basket. Legalization of drugs with higher epidemiological properties (like the 3 you named) needs to be done carefully. Softer drugs like mushrooms, MDMA or LSD, for example, would easily improve harm reduction, as well as providing taxes, reducing criminal wallets and improving drug research.  As for why they would need to be cheaper, it's because whether drugs are legal or not, the black market will still operate. The only way to reduce their market share is to compete with them. > Who benefits from having unlimited access to heroin, meth and coke?  Nobody.  Of course, we currently already have this supply.  The twist is that a consumer on the black market has no real way to know what exactly they are buying 'this time'.  Abstinence is always the best policy.  But.    Fuckin read  When you think about it, a big part of the drug shitstorm that's going on in Mexico and Central/South America has to do with the US drug market.  [With people like that taking drug-related decisions in the US](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw2wjrsdZSM), one has to wonder if it's all honest. A recent study showed marijuana usage dropped significantly in young people in states that had decriminalized it.  Sorry can't find the link, but it was this month.  You can do that here in Canada too.  Portugal decriminalized...you still have to buy your drugs from an illegal source.  De-criminalizing doesn't make the sale legal...De-criminalizing means that users only get fined or referred to drug treatment if they get caught in possession, while the dealers are still criminalized, and can face serious penalties.      Not necessarily, and actually probably not. Legal doesn't mean unregulated. That being said, if there was a kind of Coke that had coke in it, that would be fucking awesome. Feel free to not drink it if you don't want to. What is your solution?  Hmm.. You seem unfamiliar with the history of drug prohibition.   Being bad for you, If that was the case then tobacco and alcohol should be just as illegal.  way better for the government to help people with the money then have it line drug dealers pockets. Better the govt then the local gang.  that's what legalization means, I'm all for taxing and using the revenue to help everyone instead of the money going back into the black market to fuel worse activities The government is already cashing in by criminalizing the drugs. By making them legal, the revenue streams change and people don't get their lives fucked up by the law. I think legalisation would open addicts up to coming clean about their usage, as there would be less shame about using an illegal substance and less of a stereotype.  And I'm sure there wouldn't be heroin dispensaries like we now see marijuana dispensaries. I would imagine it'd be more like an allowed free dosage the addict would have access to, which eliminates the need for a black market for heroin. There's a quota for specific areas of immigration. Studying is one of them. Just about every country has a quota for those with money wanting to study from other countries. If you want to come study you could manage, but it's not cheap as you'll have to pay full price for university (citizens get considerable subsidies) plus you'll have to pay rent obviously. You have to have money saved up to study abroad.  They already know how to get high. The issue is a social one. How to reduce drug problems. The war on drugs is a failure.  How is this the most pressing problem? It's one of millions.   Would you take it if it was available? Not more drugs. Why do people think that because drugs are illegal they aren't already stupid copious and available. This would take what's already there and make it safe, clean and out of the hands of criminals. Are you stupid? But why? People will do these drugs whether they are legal or not. Might as well make it as safe as possible by regulating the market and allowing the government to profit rather than criminals. Also, drug dealers don't ID their customers whereas pharmacists would/  Yeah, I've had friends die. I'm all for legalization. Our friends and family that have died, died under the *current* system. Some shady dealer profited off their deaths. I don't see how that's better. I'm sorry. You know who defends driving?! Someone who has never been in a car accident! I'm all for moped use but cars or trucks?! NO WAY!! Sorry for your loss :(  Not all drugs behave the same. Legalizing them all the same way would be a disaster. However, I fail to see how letting the black market operate freely is a better option than regulating and controlling drug trade. They can literally can destroy entire societies?  Hell, I don't even need a source but what makes you say/think that?  Curious. Explain exactly why you think that's true.   Guess what guy, drugs are already here. Making them illegal only makes them profitable for bad people. The same people that will cut your h with quinine or even fucking fentanyl. You legalize drugs and produce them legitimately, I can guarantee you they'd be regulated and clean. Thus exponentially safer.  Look at alcohol; its dangerous, addictive, turns you stupid and takes away inhibition, coordination and sense.   Extraordinarily dangerous, tons of alcohol addiction problems. Tons of deaths annually. And it's legal. Why? Because when prohibition was put in place outlaws profited off bathtub booze and people got exactly what they were looking for anyway. You can't force people to not do drugs. However you can educate them and provide safety so the drugs don't ruin as many lives. While simultaneously taking a billion dollar monopoly away from violent gangs and cartels. Name one civilization destroyed by drug use. This is such a bullshit argument. Drugs get used all the time even though they are illegal, so legalising is going to change nothing except raise a shitload of tax money that can be used to improve infrastructure.  I agree to an extent. But does making it illegal make it better or worse for addicts? Does making it illegal make it safer or more dangerous?  Education is the way forward, not criminalisation  I have been around alot of addicts, I have been through addiction.  You know what I still can't fully shake? No matter how hard I try? As someone who used to regularly use amphetamines, cocaine and heroin?   Booze.  I've been around the bend. I'm clean now.  Legalization is only a good thing. It's not black and white, it's complex and difficult but it's a step in the right direction.  Stigmatizing drug use, making users criminal all the while handing billions of dollars over to criminal organizations is not right.  Legalization will provide education, safe practice and an economic boom. >Coming from personal experience that shit is the devil and it ruins lives and breaks apart families  That's what having it illegal does. This does not work. Look at Portugal and how treating drug users as patients rather than criminals is a far more effective way of solving the problem. Also your solution does not solve the problem of illegal drugs being a massive source of income for all types of other criminals. Let that money go to the government rather than some people traffiking cock >causing people to steal  That's caused by the high prices caused by their illegality, not by the drugs themselves. Because a person who wants to do crack is going to do crack regardless, So why make it illegal and profit criminals? I mean, they can regulate it way better and have quality control over it. Plus, what do you think pharmaceutical companies sell? The same shit with crazy up market value.  A person who knows what heroin can do will not start using it just because he can obtain it legally now just like how a junkie will still shoot heroin if its legal or illegal.  You know he's dead yeah? I think that liberal is paying attention to the fact that drug prohibition is a thousand times more harmful than the drugs themselves. You want  to drug yourself and be a lazy bum at will don't you? How to ignore reason and logic by Conservatives 101.  I guess you're correct if you ignore the positive benefits that have been seen from decriminalizing drugs and providing safe injection sites.  You mean by criminalizing people so they can't find work, places to rent etc? How to colour a planet full of mushrooms, pot, poppies, and people red/blue. its not like your kid is gonna go to the pharmacy to buy some over the counter heroin...  But at least junkies won't need to break into your car anymore to get a fix. and the fix will be safer... No i don't want to pay for people to get high, but studies show its cheaper than paying for their policing and medical costs... so fuckit.   Why not? I don't think it would be great for the country but I think it would be better than what we have now. Yes it would, you idiot. You can currently have a Heroin vacation in any med-large city of your choice today.  A little political will and at least it won't be your last visit here :-) well looks like  mexico is going to lose their moneymaker. The only value to prohibition is its supposed deterrence to use. I just don't believe in that deterrent effect. Social and cultural norms are what deter people from abusing drugs, i.e. it is tough to have a career and maintain relationships when you have a substance abuse problem. People being afraid of punishment seems to come in very far behind that, and the illegality of drugs may well entice many younger users.  It is time to move on. Don't forget the part where non-violent people are getting their lives ruined by the legal system just for doing drugs  Also, wouldn't it make more sense to just be able to buy the drugs from a pharmacist without a prescription? If a doc is just going to approve the requests anyway, might as well save the doc some time  ""Allows for easier health monitoring of addicts""  Will more easily create addicts.  ""If a prescription style service is provided it may:""  Right, because we need more prescriptions for recreational cocaine or heroin.  ""Would empty prisons overnight.""  Not exactly what you want.  Do you honestly think legalizing all drugs will mean you can sell them and use them in any way you want?  It will be regulated and taxed and there will still be a black market for drugs for the people that don't want to pay more in taxes or go through the regulations.  Oxycontin is legal heroin.  It hasn't reduced the amount of people, only increased it.  People blame the Doctors for over-prescribing it and getting people addicted.  I can't imagine how bad it would be if you can get it any a corner store without a legitimate use.  Many people are forgetting that all drugs were legalized at some point.  Societies have already gone through years of death and addiction to come to the point now where they are illegal.  You can pretty much get any movie  streaming for a very cheap price with all of the services we have now.  Piracy has only increased, not decreased like what was claimed a decade ago.  The real problem here is that you want to be able to do anything (IE: get addicted to any drug) without any consequences (the taxpayers pay for your rehab, clean drugs). Love that song Have you ever seen ""How it's made"" on Discovery Channel.

Instead of settling their disputes with guns, they'll settle them with lawyers. The reason gangs use violence is because they have no legal recourse when disputes arise. > Certain drugs should always be illegal: Opium (Heroin) please look at how it started two entire wars.  As opposed to now?  It's completely illegal and countless people are addicted to Opiates?  An Opiate addiction they won't seek help for because it's illegal?   Sorry, the argument doesn't carry weight.  It should be legal and we should be diverting money into addiction programs to help keep our people healthy.  > Certain drugs should always be illegal: Opium (Heroin) please look at how it started two entire wars.   By your logic, religion and various resources (e.g., land, precious metals, oil) should be illegal.   edit: Oh, also, heroin is not the same as opium--they're two different drugs. Also derived from opium poppy: codeine & morphine, both of which are prescription medications in the US (as is heroin in some other western nations).  1. False equivalency. Drugs are not nukes and do not pose the same existential threat to human existence. Your point is laughably dishonest.   2. Nothing you say here can be considered a compelling argument because you fail to support your statements. For instance, why do you believe two 19th century trade conflicts are relevant rusty? Because they have a drug in their name? You must be joking.  Your arguments are lacking. Consider a different approach.  You REALLY need to look in to what they are doing in Portugal. Personal possession and use, is legal, trafficking is not. You take the criminal aspect away from the users. Been doing it over a decade IIRC. Very positive results.  Making something legal for personal use is different than making production and distribution. Opium isn't heroin.  >Certain drugs should always be illegal  Why? Laws should be about harm reduction. We know that people are gonna take heroin etc. regardless of whether it is legal or not, so the choice is whether you want to criminalise those who need heroin and force them to use street-grade shit, or whether you actually want to care for them with safe injection clinics and medical grade heroin. So if we just have yet more draconian law enforcement (Singapore, Japan) are problems will be solved huh? So, as a drug user yourself, you believe that if you were a bit more frightened of the criminal justice system you wouldn't do drugs? I'm not worried about a meth head shooting a ICBM loaded with a meth bomb. Portugal is a fascinating real world case study. I would say their approach to drug legalization has been a resounding success.   Why could we not do that same here? Yep. Their addiction rate dropped dramatically, and the number of prisoners per capita did as well. Drug use across the board is lower than it has ever been in Portugal. Unfortunately, i don't see it happening in America any time soon. Our government officials aren't *all* as dumb as they seem; im sure most of them are aware that the war on drugs is an absolute failure but there are too many industries thriving because of it. Private prisons, rehabs and pharmaceutical companies wound lose a lot of money and the corrupt entity known as the DEA would have to close up shop. I hope I live to see the day, but in our greed driven society I don't see it happening. Any progress we make as a country is eventually undermined by some backwards politician. > http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1893946,00.html  According to this article Portugal *decriminalized* all drugs, they did not *legalize* them. This is an important and significant distinction. > and now has gone from a country which had one of the higher percentage of drug users to one of the lowest.  There is an interesting [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/johann_hari_everything_you_think_you_know_about_addiction_is_wrong) about addiction, which basicly explains why their way to treat drug users is succesful however they decriminalized it and didnt legalize it. No one should be punished for their mental health problems,  but its  bad idea for the state to function as enabler and providing the drugs. That will have a way different outcome than in Portugal. Yeah I read about this. Was a good idea. and most government's response ' tldr' Vaguely I read about it years ago but it was good to catch up. Looks like a net positive outcome. on the other hand, countries in Asia such as China and Singapore went the opposite direction and enforced extreme punishment to ban drugs and achieved even greater results Yeah that's a great point. > I've lost a lot of friends to it and I can say from experience people have a lot to learn about it.  Congratulations, you are advocating the policies that killed them.  They did not die due to heroin.  They died due to its illegality allowing shit product (made of fillers and improperly-mixed fentanyl rather than actual heroin) to be sold, leading to uncertainty about dosing (physical quantity and dosage not being linked) and resulting in deaths.  Given a pure and consistent product, heroin has little in the way of side effects beyond dependence.  [Heroin-maintenance therapy is a thing that has been used successfully for decades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin-assisted_treatment).

I believe you just named one huge part of the problem. Make one drug much more available than every other one, and of course you're going to funnel drug addicts of all kinds towards that drug. Make them all equally available and I highly doubt anybody goes from weed to heroin just because it's legal.

You guys buy your alcohol from cartel / mafia in your neighbourhood after prohibition ended? Everything you are referring to is happening _now_ because of the prohibition and lack of regulation.

Which one would you prefer for your friends: a) get help to addiction and psychologically since you HAVE ISSUES if you use heroin regularly. heroin addicts usually got some heavy childhood / life is going down the drain otherwise b) get thrown to jail and beaten by cops calling you no good punk. c) in the land of Duterte get your friend's brains blown to pieces   This is what legalization is all about. Give them help like normal human beings or call the non-humans and justify treating them like jews in nazi Germany. ""Not"" incarcerating a person for having, using, or even abusing drugs isn't the same as endorsing the use of drugs. It's recognizing that our current system only exacerbates any problems the addict may have, and will very likely cause them to re-offend. It's recognizing that harm reduction, addiction counseling, and withdrawal treatment is the true method of eliminating drug abuse.  [Shopper's Drug Mart, one of Canada's largest pharmacy retailer, has applied for medical marijuana dispensary licenses](http://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/shoppers-drug-mart-formally-applies-to-distribute-marijuana-report).

Though they've said they don't wish to enter the production side of it.   What do you think spice was?  This already happens right now Yeah I can see the crack cocaine consultation will go great.  I see what you are saying but how many doctors just want to spend their full time just saying yes or no to drug tourists.  Which  is going to be a huge problem if you say anyone can get anything with a consultation. No. Thats not the point at all. The point is, what i do in my home and in my own time is my business. If i want to take any amount of a substance i can. You cant use the fact that perhaps someone dies using it because you can die by overdosing on a lot of legal substances. The point is, if you don't want drug cartels, then you just have to make the substace available. Its not ""ok we're going to allow you to have a little"", its ""stfu and dont tell me what i can do inside my house."" same goes for homosexuality, religion, and lots of other things.  I've felt for a while that perhaps a better way to deal with drugs is controlled legalization (though for cannabis I believe in full legalization). If  someone felt a need for opioids or amphetamines they could go to a professional consultant/therapists of some sort, talk about how they things are going, and then that person could give them a prescription lasting for a 14-day period. How I imagine it there would not be any sort of forced rehabilitation, but the person they have to talk to to get a prescription should be knowledgeable about rehabilitation options and if a person shows interest in that they could function as a guide.   The goal, for me, is to ensure that drugs are produced in a legal, safe, regulated, manner. To drain the money out of illegal networks, to ensure that people with drug addiction are able to get the help they need immediately when they want it, and to ensure that drug addicts does not have to immerse themselves in a community of other addicts, dealers, and criminals. Make the path towards rehabilitation as short as it can be.  When it comes to psychedelic drugs I believe there should be safe places people could go if they wanted to experiment with such substances. Where they can be informed about the effects, and were there are healthcare professionals on hand in case anyone needs any sort of help dealing with what they are experiencing.   All of this is probably a bit pie in the sky, but I believe that in a free society people should be allowed to experiment and make their own choices. I just want those choices to be informed, and for society to ensure that we are able to manage it in a way that is minimally destructive to the individuals specifically and society in general. The current policy of criminalization is purely destructive to everyone.  Please don't. I'm already sick of telling people why they're not appropriate for medical marijuana when I think it should be legal for them to just buy it. I don't want to be rubber stamping their recreational meth. > And it's not an isolated example either, there's other drugs that wouldn't become safer through manufacturing regulation, such as fentanyl.  Sure it would. Regulation would lead to consistent doses and total knowledge of what you're taking. You would get far fewer fentanyl over doses if people knew they were taking it, rather than believing it was heroin. The issue with the health question is that illegality does nothing to prevent usage. It does encourage more contaminated product. It does make it harder to ensure people are using safe amounts. It does make it harder for doctors to get an actual clear history from patients about their use. It does prevent people from coming in to seek help to get over their addiction.   Nothing about criminality prevents these health concerns, but it does create new ones.  I'm torn between these two positions. Legalizing recreational drugs is encouraging drug addiction as much as legalizing alcohol is encouraging alcoholism.  Yet beer is legal. Is ""People are going to do it anyway"" actually such a terrible justification for getting rid of prohibition?  Isn't the point of making drugs illegal to deter people from using drugs?  If a law isn't doing its job, dump it. I disagree.  Does having alcohol legal mean that we are enabling alcoholism?  Addiction is a mental health issue and needs to be treated as such.  Can you imagine the amount of money that is spend on the ""War on Drugs""?  I mean check out this site: http://www.drugsense.org/cms/wodclock    $15 BILLION in 2010.  And 145,000ish arrests.  ITS FUCKING DRUGS.  IF YOU DONT LIKE IT, YOU DONT HAVE TO DO IT.   Why do you care if other people do it?  You're saying the best solution is to lock everyone up for doing something in the privacy of their own home.  People get fired, get fined, and they can have their lives ruined, all because they did something in their bedroom.   Arrest and jail is not for non violent drug users.  It fucking blows my mind that people think jail is the answer for someone doing drugs.  How much money do you think it would take for public health education and addiction treatment?     my god I could go on but its useless I think.... Portugal didn't ""legalize"", they decriminalized. We're not talking about Bob being able to go down to the 7-11 and buy heroin, we're talking about not sending drug users to prison. Decriminalization also means that people caught with drugs don't have a criminal record following them for life, decreasing their prospects at jobs and potentiomally ruining their entire future, sending them back to using because at that point, why not?  We can use the tax payer money that would have payed for them to sit in prison to fund treatment, education, harm reduction, and assisting addicts into integrating into society by helping them get jobs and give them purpose.  That's what Portugal did. That would work perfectly fine in the west. I'm not saying it will happen, I'm saying it should happen.  The costs for the war on drugs are a total waste of resources. Further, that is a major reason the US has 5% of the world's population but 25% of the world's incarcerated population.  Shame on anyone who wishes to continue this shameful prosecution and wasting of lives by felony and incarceration. It's people like you holding us all back > The US public is slowly being sold on Universal health care, but I can see that vastly reversing if drugs are legal for everyone and Bob across the street gets all his bills paid even though he rots his life with drugs.  Your reasoning is sound, if not for the fact that Bob across the street already rots his life with drugs. Criminalisation is not stopping anyone.  > You can't have both. High quality drugs regulated by a government are not cheap. This would increase the 'profit motive' for dealers to step on (dilute) their products and sell it more affordably.  Ehn... A lot of the most common drugs can be made extremely cheap. They are only expensive because either someone is risking a free life to make them or import them. Cocaine? Comes from a plant. Heroin? Also comes from a plant. Marijuana? A plant, also called weed, because it grows like a weed.   Like 1 marijuana plant can make from an ounce to a pound of weed... street value $300-5000. A single coca plant grows to be 10 feet tall and can probably yield about $6000-10,000 worth of cocaine. It doesn't cost $10,000 to grow these fucking things, that's mostly all drug producer and dealer profits baked in.  If it was legal, and there was healthy competition producing all these drugs, the prices could easily be slashed so much that it wouldn't be profitable for anyone who doesn't have a big operation. Go to your local pharmacy and pick up a 5 grams of cocaine for $20. Right now you'd pay at least $200 to some shady guy in a dimly lit parking lot.  > High quality, high purity narcotics are not going to solve overdoses. It can help people keep from killing themselves by accidentally taking the wrong drugs, since you know what you're buying, but too much of a high purity narcotic will cause you to OD.  High purity will certainly help with all the accidental ODs. I guess in the end, you can't fix stupid. Some people will die from alcohol poisoning every year... just like some people will die from prescription medication ODs. But right now one of the biggest killers in Canada is fentanyl, and I don't think the majority of people who have used fentanyl did so intentionally, it's just that their drugs have been laced with it and it's extremely easy to OD on that shit. > You can't have both. High quality drugs regulated by a government are not cheap. This would increase the 'profit motive' for dealers to step on (dilute) their products and sell it more affordably.  Actually you can. I know this because I just went to a pharmacy the other day and bought 500 tablets of 200mg ibuprofen for about $10. Once the synthesis of a drug has been worked out it is usually not very expensive to make, and the procedure to synthesize these drugs has been known for a very long time. Think about the number of opiates available for prescription. It would be the same for cocaine and meth and other drugs.   look at states in America that legalized weed. That is exactly what happened. If you can get drugs in a legal place, why would you deal with a drug pusher? That is doing illegal acts and dealing with criminals. Why do that if you don't have to? Yah, coffee is nearly 20k for a kilo of it, oh wait, it's actually about $10 because it's legal. That 20k is for cocaine because it's illegal.  You're confusing drugs with bleeding edge pharma tech(which is still overpriced). thats still the thing isn't it? It seems like according to this sub the ONLY OPTION is to legalize it when history proved there are many other ways.  > See [Iron Law of Prohibition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_law_of_prohibition)  Th Iron Law of Prohibition, which is by no means agreed upon by all economists, suggests that harder drug enforcement results in the production of harder drugs. It says nothing of the societal popularity of a drug.  > Bulky opium was illegal, so refined heroin became more prevalent, albeit with significant risk from blood-borne disease because of injection by needle, and far greater risk of death from overdose.  Except we've seen in history that when opium was legal it caused serious social problems, resulting in multiple rebellions and wars against the suppliers. Obviously something is wrong with this narrative. > Legalization. Regulation. These fix these problems.  I disagree with the notion that this would be preferable for *all* drugs. For example, meth doesn't cause a whole lot of direct harm to users, provided they don't overdose on it, so there isn't much room for improvement with regulated (or free market) legalization. But users can sometimes go for a month or so without sleeping if they're using regularly, and the sleep deprivation causes a whole host of physical and mental problems that can be permanent. And this in turn creates an increased financial burden for society, so it makes sense to restrict access to it as much as possible. > Treating them like they're on the same level as a thief or a murderer is only showing them they were right and no one cares about them.   That's not what I'm suggesting at all. I favour decriminalization so that users can be treated like a health problem, not a criminal problem. But there's a lot of fallout from use that the rest of society has to deal with, particularly in a financial sense, so dealers specifically should continue to be prosecuted in my opinion. And to be clear, it should also be recognized that a lot of drugs don't create very many social problems, such as marijuana, and so should be fully legal. > All legalization would do is take away the violence and money away from cartels...  Fentanyl doesn't come from South American cartels. It's brought in illegally from China where the drug is manufactured *legally*. The violence which you speak of is non-existent.  > Even if we did go with decriminalizing, you can't guarantee the quality of the drug. So someone looking for heroin might get fentanyl by mistake and die.  Or they might get regular ol' heroin and die. It's not as easy to OD on as fentanyl, but you can still OD on it.  > There's very little logic behind the arguments for decriminalization unless your irrationally scared or in support of cartels, which you might be.  You're making a ridiculous characterization of me based on a totally erroneous argument of your own design.  > There will be some number of us in this forum whose lives are benefited from the illegal drug trade and will be defending it.  I can see that by the amount of messages in my inbox, but that isn't a reason for me to accept your arguments. I'm not in favour of designating any drugs *illegal*, I'm in favour of legalizing soft drugs like marijuana, LSD, etc. and decriminalizing hard drugs like meth or fentanyl. The point of this approach is to treat users like a health problem, and to treat dealers like *socially* criminal problem. > I suspect that ""recreational"" use of fentanyl would be, cough, fine if the consumer knew WTF they where consuming.  [This is demonstrably false](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/the-new-face-of-fentanyl-addiction-kati-s-story-1.3766697). By *this* I mean the article, legalizing all drugs. It's under 3 years left. Canada's election cycles are 4 years. Yes, that's the point of the article. I just have to ask, how are can you be so fuckin stupid?  The government, thank you very much.  Honestly with something such as this people will have a strong opinion on it regardless of the media. I bet you if you walk up to 100 random people on the street tomorrow and proposed this to them, you'd be met with a lot of ""No way!"" Believe it or not some people make decisions without any external influence or research.  ...and coffee. Sugar could be argued for too.    And then we have prescription meds like Benzos, Adderall, Opiates, etc, etc.  Wouldn't legal drugs be less lethal when consumed due to their purity or something? Currently most illict drugs are cut with many unnecessary substances that can significantly harm the user. Things like adulterants and excipients. If they're synthesized in a safe, legal lab setting with qualified scientists at the helm the result will be truly different. If the raw material is legal a large percentage of people will tend toward it instead. Although there would still be a market for the coke, dope and pills; it will be smaller.   My issue is three fold with broad legalization:(1) that legalizing pharmaceutical made products would make another tobacco/alcohol giant corporation people killers. I mean, the drug companies are already that, legalizing their products further (or the shitty heroin coke factories in the jungle) would only give them more credence. Legalizing the raw product will actually take money from the companies making oxy and morphine and the like. As people could be given instructions for how to use the raw ingredients to battle their chronic pain by doctors; only the products used would be teas leaves or smokable forms which would be dramatically cheaper -i am on the fence about smoking opium, but i would tend to think it should be legal...the opium tea definitely .  (2) I think we have proved that humans can't handle having processed and powdered and pilled forms of drugs (or food really) that they can shoot or eat readily available without falling addict. I mean, we will fall addicted to coca leaf and opium tea too but like our addictions to alcohol/weed/caffeine, raw coca and opium are things we can handle more easily. Our species has been using the raw products for thousands of years...the processed stuff only 100 years.  (3) Driving/Working. The u.s. is based on the car. By having the drugs/phones/radios/mirrors/writing tablets/movies/tv surrounding us in cars we already end up with a highway death rate that is staggering. If we legalized coke/heroin it would be a whole nother level of death on the road. And again, if the raw forms were legal the road hazard will still exist but in smaller forms.   So, yes, while keeping them (harder drugs) illegal we will still be offering a black market of sorts and keeping some drug dealers; but by legalizing the raw product only we are taking a giant chunk from the drug dealers and drug companies. And, more importantly, we are cutting out a shitty processing middleman that really should only be allotted by doctors or trained pros, like chemotherapy or aides regiments.   I suppose it also comes down to politics as well. I don't believe there will ever be legislation for a legal recreational coke/dope/pills culture in the u.s.; it would be easier to gain ability to use the raw forms in some cities and more progressive states.  Even if drugs were legal producing them may not be. I believe it is illegal for me to brew hard liquor in my basement and it will definitely be illegal to create meth in your basement. And think of the tax revenue Im not a politician, I don't sell solutions. Legalizing look like state-sponsored slavery. The precedents (until the 30's) showed how the hard drugs legal bizness created tremendous social issues.  I would say, legalizing weed and some chemicals (MDMA, LSD, Shrooms) and controlled free medical distribution (under strong supervision and monitoring, with proper cousnelling) for very hooked users of opiates and coke stuff in medical missions in badly affected areas. Id say basically the dutch/Swiss way.  And of course, decriminalized usage for all users. Lets stop sending sick people to prison. Unless they do stupid shits like DUI. I understand that line of reasoning. I just don't necessarily agree that it will have as good of an effect (see reasons above) or be as easy to implement as people say.   I see problems with a free dosage. If there is a set dosage, who decides that dosage? I certainly wouldn't want to be the HCP responsible for that. Litigation risk is way too high. Huge variances in tolerance would make for dangerous game. Some addicts take doses of opioids that would kill the average person multiple times a day, and the margin between what an addict takes in order to feel a high and overdose can be small. Do we have an absolute maximum dosage? If so I think we quickly go back to the black market problem. Neither health care providers, nor drug users would be happy with such a system.  Most universities tend to have an incredible amount of financial support available for international studies through scholarships and other incentives, and often these are considerably more than domestic students ever receive.  I don't know what kind of world some people live in where things like heroin and cocaine can be considered ""clean"" and ""safe"".  My point is, making all drugs legal will mean they will be much more abundant and readily accessible. Addicts will have less of a reason to quit due to lack of legal consequences, that neighbor who smokes too much pot will make no attempt to keep his place from smelling like shit, and it will encourage (even legitimize) unhealthy and dangerous lifestyles.  Even if they did put an age restriction on them, you know kids will try to get their hands on them just as easily as they can get a six-pack of beer. look at new york city in the 1980s  if you introduce certain drugs to a certain society, it can easily spread like wildfire and cause destruction  opium use is spreading like mad in certain parts of north america right now - its a combination of drug and public How naive. Legal or not methheads will rob you for all you got to score some dope.  I didn't offer a solution. You can certainly change the way you go about it, the tactics of the drug war are just plain bad but a blanket this is illegal will have unforeseen consequences.  No it's not, it's caused by the fact they can't hold down a job and will do anything for a fix. Yeah so is Tupac haha Ive already been using heroin for the last ten years at will, my friend. That's kinda the point As was said in Stephen Soderbergh's movie ""Traffic"" and I'll paraphrase here, it's easier for kids to get drugs than alcohol. This is not right. additionally, when you never know when you will find a certain drug again, it makes every oppertunity to get it seem much more critical.  I may want, ecstacy. I go out to looking for it, and I'm offered DMT, and people are saying how I may never see DMT here again for months, or years! The temptation to buy, and try, more drugs than I want to, is huge! . . . But I might not even want DMT! Yet you can see how a person would end up buying some. I know plenty of people who don't do a certain drug because either it is illegal or they would have to go through illegal channels to get it. While there are definitely good arguments for legalization social drugs like cocaine and molly probably are used less because of illegality. I don't think the idea is perfect, but while I am totally on board with legalisation, I think it should be slightly difficult to get access to drugs. It shouldn't be as easy as buying cough medicine. Perhaps going to a doc is OTT, maybe applying for a licence online and waiting a day to be approved would be a better solution. I really have to applaud the Dutch. You've been at the forefront of considered drug laws and really, the rest of Europe and the world should have followed suit at the time, but don't get me wrong. I am not for one second suggesting free access.  I'm suggesting a perscription type service where it would not be illegal to get drugs on a prescription and getting them as such would totally legal and cost the same as on the street, but street selling drugs would land you with very stiff penalties and would not be tolerated by the law. Prohibition has never worked and it is about time that we face up the the likelihood that it never will and rethink how this battle can be won. Do you consider alcohol a hard drug? Working from the bottom up...  > (the taxpayers pay for your rehab, clean drugs).  Actually, the drugs pay for the rehab  >Piracy has only increased, not decreased like what was claimed a decade ago.  What does this have to do with the price of turnips, but while you raise it, the jury's still out on whether access to free media is actually a good or bad thing for the entertainment industry.  > Many people are forgetting that all drugs were legalized at some point.  Actually, people are forgetting that there was a blind eye turned to drug addiction. Heroin is a patented drug from Pharma giant Bayer and was actually advertised as a cure for methadone addiction. However, the understanding of addiction and the ways to fight it have transformed over the past century so it is not a valid argument.   > Oxycontin is legal heroin. It hasn't reduced the amount of people, only increased it. People blame the Doctors for over-prescribing it and getting people addicted.  Well there's the point. People are over-prescribed it. It is used as a treatment, but while we're on it, diamorphine is the legal form of heroin. Oxycontin was synthesized to be a replacement for heroin.  > Do you honestly think legalizing all drugs will mean you can sell them and use them in any way you want? It will be regulated and taxed and there will still be a black market for drugs for the people that don't want to pay more in taxes or go through the regulations.  Yes, I do - Illegal drugs already have a tax associated with them. It's the tax due to illegality. Take that massive markup and spend it in the community. Fix the cause of the problems and you fix the problem. Colorado has had a huge boost to its education budget by taking any taxes from weed sales and pumping them back into the community.  >""Would empty prisons overnight."" >Not exactly what you want.  Why on earth would you not want that?   > Will more easily create addicts.  Again, incorrect. Young people who have ready access to hard drugs are far more likely to take up something on a whim, than an adult who has to make a conscious decision to take heroin. Today, any person, regardless of their age or where they are in the world, can have hard drugs any time they want because the current tactics are working so well /s.  Still, probable that there is no convincing the right. The failing war will continue to fail for decades to come until people finally realised that doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result is utter madness. The key is to drop the drug price below the black market. There is a certain tipping point where it would no longer be be worth the risk for drug dealers to sell drugs on the black market.  Also, there is no evidence that legalizing drugs increases usage rates. And even if it did, who gives a fuck as long as they aren't hurting anyone else? Why should you (or anybody else) be making lifestyle choices for anybody else? Some guy doing blow in a bathroom at a club, or dropping acid in their apartment, or doing molly at a rave isn't going to negatively impact your life anymore than someone getting drunk at a bar and minding their own business. No. NO!  Fuuuuck, there goes my work productivity, now I must watch as many as I can.   ""how it works"" is also decent.  Every time I watch that show, I imagine a ghetto version called ""How shit's made, yo!""  Also not true.  Gangs use violence because it gives them an avenue to attain power that is usually only reserved for the state monopoly.  The 'shake down' scheme of ordering protection from a business is not a legitimate means of doing business.  As well when you hear about gang violence hitting convenience stores or other store robberies there is no legitimate way for them to get the money from that person.  Gangs are not people who are not heroes providing necessary services to people.  They offer vices to the desperate people who can't resist them.  We legalize some avenues of gang cash because we think taxing them allows for revenues for controlling the consequences of them.  But don't think for a second that gangs won't operate outside of the law when they get the opportunity.  Al Capone was arrested for not paying his taxes. They use violence because they can. You're not entirely correct; a lot of opiate addictions are to *prescription* opiates, ie obtained legally (there's a real problem with over prescribing opiates) Ban the land.  Oil should probobly be illegal. There's a difference between making something legal and decriminalizing it. You can have safe injection sites without a drug being legalized/decriminalized.  Hell it's not just industry, trying to legalize drugs is a political death sentence.  There are a lot of really uneducated people out there who can be quickly brought to a fury if you go against what they ""know to be true"", facts be damned.  Then another loud angry guy shows up and bam, you're out of office. Here in Canada we couldn't because it would be a massive hit to our relations with the US. No PM will risk that. Just give us weed and we'll call it even. Yes, they decriminalised them - meaning you get ticketed for using inappropriately, like /u/JustAnotherJon said. Seems like a good way to get people off drugs, cut down on criminals' business, and reduce wasted police resources, all without turning the country into a pot-shop centre like Amsterdam.  Only because they did not want to deal with the international controversy that would have followed from legalization. Well yeah. They don't want to throw addicts in jail, just dealers. Agreed and it's not the right answer either. Denver legalized it and is now going to start having cafes similar to Amsterdam. That is the future that we need. Not to interrupt the chaffing of the Portugal circle jerk. Reddit loves that example  Police will still bust my chops for having a little weed if they are in the mood for it.  And then make me throw it out or step on it the bastard.   As someone who deals frequently with addicts, this is important.    I think to some people ""drugs"" means weed, or maybe mdma or cocaine.  But people addicted to meth and heroin, I dunno.  Their addiction drives their problems in other ways than just the criminalization of the drug.   Once you start explicitly talking about legalization of heroin and crystal meth, I'm not so sure.    Decriminalization sure.  In fact we do that in many places effectively already.  Specifically for possession, but for sale?  Not sure it's a good idea there.   Hey, you know what's in this week? Rampaging authoritarianism! Let's get us some of that! All the cool countries are doing it! Damn right, let's compare with countries halfway across the world with entirely different culture.   All countries in east asia have substantially lower drug use than the West, it must be geography! Move the entire country across the pacific! /s   https://www.unodc.org/wdr2016/interactive-map.html  https://www.unodc.org/documents/wdr2015/World_Drug_Report_2015.pdf I honestly thought the ""clinic"" solution was the best idea I heard so far.   All drugs are legal, but the really hard drugs like heroin, meth, or anything prone to kill you by OD can only be used in clinics. You can't leave the clinic while you're high and attendants monitor your usage and dosage.   Instead of feeling like a cool thing to do, it stigmatizes drug and forces it to feel like an illness by making them regularly go to a clinical setting to get their fix. They can also be educated on the dangers and addiction and so forth. Pretty much would sap at least half the fun out of these drugs instantly.  Also, this isn't left/right politics. If you or any family member has experience the shit of addiction, we all go through a million thoughts of what will work. I don't think any of us ruled Durete's drug policies as successful.   Big up for the stats.  No, I apologize, I did not read the article and should have. I was wrong about the kind of environment I was arguing against.  Idk about Canada but in the US it's becoming increasingly well known that [doctors hand out prescriptions too easily too often tho.](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-prescription-painkiller-overuse-met-20160324-story.html) been happening long before spice Again, you're not getting the whole point.  The point is, let people handle their drugs how they see fit.  They should be OTC.  The reason they should be OTC is because you can see what happens when they're not.  People make them in their basement.  Drug cartels make them and import them.  They get made.  A person cant make penicillin in their basement.  Trust me, if they could, they would.  So you cant treat cocaine and meth and weed like other drugs.  They are not the same.    The drug cartels, the hatred toward police, the prison system, and tons of other systems exist solely because a substance that you can make and consume in your basement is illegal.    Its a really weird thing to consider I know.  Its a huge change and people dont like change.   > The point is, what i do in my home and in my own time is my business.   This is not an excuse for everything If a person absolutely insists, then don't deny them. But make sure they're equipped with proper information. If only as a way to avoid major backlash when this kicks in if a bunch of people can't handle their shit. Get a different job The therapeutic index for fentanyl is 270.  Therapeutic index is calculated like this: LD50/ED50 LD= Lethal dose ED = Effective Dose  This means that the lethal dose of fentanyl is 270 greater than the effective dose for 50% of patients. But the lethal dose for rats is 3.1 milligrams/kg, less for monkeys but lets be optimistic.  So if we go back to our calulation:  270 = 3.1/ED50  270xED50 = 3.1  ED50 = 3.1/270  ED50 = 0.011 mg/kg = 11 ug/kg  The effective dose is 11ug/kg. The people who take fentanyl should take care to note that you can't eye ball a dose of fentanyl, even if its pure pharmacy grade stuff.   Now I honestly don't care what people put in their bodies, get high as balls for all I care, but when the difference between a lethal dose and a good time is an imperceptible quantity then you might want to rethink that habbit. I mentioned fentanyl in passing, the bulk of my post concerned meth and the problems surrounding that drug -- problems that you have left completely unaddressed. Having said that, [people knowingly abuse fentanyl without any illusions about the drug being something else](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/the-new-face-of-fentanyl-addiction-kati-s-story-1.3766697), and they still overdose because it's difficult to self-administer properly, not because they're acquiring the drug with inconsistent doses. Recreational prescriptions administered by doctors, with dedicated physicians administering doses at local pharmacies.  Want to get high on meth/heroin? Convince your doctor you aren't high-risk, and go to CVS to get your shot, call an Uber home.  For example: I don't think you should be able to get a recreational prescription for hard drugs if you have dependants under the age of 21. You'd also get people who don't use the drug to start using it. There's a lot of people out there who would start using opioids if they had easy access to them.  Spot on  If drugs are legal, we can ensure the quality of drugs and also give a safe place for addicts to do drugs. This way no one is being sold one drug and being told it is another. Addicts could seek help without being arrested too. For most people, specifically in the states with legal weed you speak of, the answer is cost. Illegal marijuana purchases are typically not high risk, and are cheaper than the legal route.   Buyers are not taking a major risk in purchasing pot illegally in a state where possession is legal. The acquisition of the drugs is illegal but once possessed they aren't breaking laws.   On a longer timeline I could be wrong, but currently it's still cheaper to buy weed illegally than it is to buy at a shop. Time will tell.  Pharmaceuticals are a good example, yes. They're also legal and result in almost 50k annual deaths due to overdose. Legality and illegality do not directly reflect prices of drugs, in all cases. The price of pot in Colorado went up after legalization, it is currently going down but hasn't hit street prices yet. I'm willing be wrong about prices, not speaking in absolutes here, but we currently don't have a long enough timeline to prove what you're saying about legal drugs costing less.  More simply, fentanyl is manufactured more readily. It's a synthetic opioid that can avoid many supply chain issues. Economic theories aside this is a likely reason for its recent spike.   I don't believe the consumers want it. My addiction patients are largely pretty scared of it.  >Th Iron Law of Prohibition, which is by no means agreed upon by all economists  Then they're stupid or extremely biased. It's a special case of the [AlchianAllen effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchian%E2%80%93Allen_effect) and it pretty much follows straight from very simple supply and demand calculations. On top of that the empirical studies done on the subject show pretty much unilateral support for it. I'd be happy to see a study that shows the opposite if you have one.  > It says nothing of the societal popularity of a drug.  But it does affect the popularity. It changes the prices of drugs disproportionally and punishes less potent ones more. Since many drugs are substitution goods this will shift the demand to the more potent drugs.  There's a reason it's America that has a huge Fentanyl problem and not Europe.  >Except we've seen in history that when opium was legal it caused serious social problems, resulting in multiple rebellions and wars against the suppliers. Obviously something is wrong with this narrative.  I'm not saying legal drugs are without problems. I'm saying prohibition makes the problems worse. > For example, meth  You mean Adderall? Maybe Heroin is a better ex...what's that you say? Legal heroin is called methadone?  >I disagree with the notion that this would be preferable for all drugs.  And yet you could furnish no example. (Please correct me if I'm wrong and you have an example/support of things getting much, much worse after legalization of a controlled substance.)  In Christian theology, a supreme all knowing, all powerful, cannot be foiled, deity was unable to prevent man from doing something he didn't want them to do.  And yet man stands thinking he can.  Even if you're not religious, you suggest failure. You suggest atrocity. You suggest throwing addicts in prison for being addicts and for no other reason. This is how prohibition works. It doesn't stop the behavior it claims to stop.  It simply ruins the lives of those that ignore those very prohibition laws. Examples do in fact include those that should be enforcing those laws.  Prohibition as a concept utterly fails on paper.  Legalization, regulation, and a system of support for those that fall will do more good, cause less damage, and cost less by far.  And the only reason we don't do this, is because for some reason, ""getting high"" is a bad thing while ""getting drunk"" tends to be socially acceptable up until you hurt someone as a result.  I simply suggest parity. Ah. Gotcha. Sorry about the misinterpretation.  Sorry for the unfair characterization. There is some type of criminal activity happening to get fentanyl to the streets, and in that black market there will be violence on the streets of America with the gangs that control it and corruption of our justice system at some point, further hurting innocents.  It's easier to die when you don't know the purity of your drug, it's a given, esp if it's cut with fentanyl, that's been the cause of the increased spike in opiate ODs in the states. Make it legal and allow nestle or some company like bayer to sell it and you will see a dramatic decrease in drug death. People will have time to get their life back together. Most addicts are not trying to kill themselves, they have families and loved ones and often have jobs. They are sick individuals who deserve compassion, not the hammer. But production of a dangerous drug WOULD still be illegal. It's a huge fire hazard to make meth in a basement. I don't think most people who want to legalize drugs are saying people should be able to produce meth in their own homes.   Cigarettes are legal but producing tobacco for the intent of selling is not. Trudeau won't do it. I don't think any mainstream politician will. Canada doesn't have election cycles. Harper passed a fixed date election law, but then ignored it.  sugar.. man I hope Big sugar doesn't put me on a watchlist after posting this comment  [Oreos More Addictive Than Cocaine? -- Dr Pam Peeke at TEDxWallStreet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTIq0jnUnCg)  [Big Sugars Secret Ally? Nutritionists - NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/13/opinion/sunday/big-sugars-secret-ally-nutritionists.html?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=opinion-c-col-right-region&region=opinion-c-col-right-region&WT.nav=opinion-c-col-right-region&_r=1)  kinda included sugar and script pills in legal highs, but thanks for elaborating! And coke and MDMA and nitrous and 2cb and ketamin Why stop there? If you argue long enough you could say that food in general is a drug to for giving you energy you need to survive. > Wouldn't legal drugs be less lethal when consumed due to their purity or something?  This is only true of some drugs. And fentanyl would be one of the exceptions, because it's incredibly potent it might actually be (slightly) safer if it was cut with something else. Meth would be another exception, because the drug itself doesn't cause a whole lot of direct harm, it's the damage caused by sleep deprivation when continously used that causes real damage, which purity doesn't negate in any way. etc. Dosing would be far easier in a regulated market, that's for sure. You would know the exact strength of what you're buying. I agree but the only think I don't agree is legalize verses decriminalized. If you decriminalize drugs in general, the distribution of drugs is still illegal, and you are still allowing drug cartels and unsafe drugs to exist.  When I was 14 it was easier to get cocaine then beer. Want to know why? Because I was looking for it and didn't have to be 19 to buy it.  All drugs are already available.  Kids who want to do drugs, are going to do drugs. Believe me.  You'd rather that kid bought a fatal dose of impure fentanyl laced heroin rather than have a structured system where he can be of legal age and legally get pure safer heroin, administered in a safe area where they can get honest information and responsible use/treatment information?   I have a son and my wife takes your stance on it. She asks ""would you want (son) to just be able to buy heroin whenever he wants?""  I say the same thing: Absolutely not, but if (son) is ever looking for heroin. I'd prefer he get it from a safe place, that's regulated by government rather than from some gang banger who cuts it with anything to make a buck.  Legalizing drugs will not make things more available, it will just take what's already there (and never going away) and make it safer. or like. china during the OPIUM WARS. I'm being pedantic, but isn't New York City still currently thriving? The city wasn't ""literally destroyed"".  How condescending. You think that if we legalized drugs and educated people about them instead of lying to them and fear mongering maybe that'd help? They can't get a job because they have a criminal record for possession etc  that's the idea.  http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/crosstown-clinic-heroin-addiction-1.3779768   here is a working example.  Crack and Amphetamines would be trickier to support though since they're far more damaging.  It is indeed way easier. Everyone knows who the drug dealers are in school. A quick conversation or phone call and you are on the road to get whatever illegal drug you want. Getting alcohol usually involves some sort of theft or being friends with the few kids whose parents don't mind contributing to the delinquency of minors. > it's easier for kids to get drugs than alcohol.  Despite the popular misconception, alcohol *is* a drug. What we should be looking at then are the harms caused to individuals and to society so that we can create evidence-based drug policy.  > http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2010/11/drugs_cause_most_harm ""Once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to take it as far as you can.""  -HST But why should responsibility be left to the government and not the individual? Why do we have to coddle and protect everyone. Why can't people be responsible for themsleves. Yeah I think that would make more sense. Kind of like a wait period to buy a handgun No. The difference is I drink a glass of beer, maybe 2 or 3. I do this a few times a week and I can stop drinking without any issues. Now let's take heroin or meth these are far more addictive. Sure thing alcoholics should (and get in the Netherlands) proper support as well though the consequences of being addicted to alcohol which to begin is already harder are far less troubling then those to certain hard drugs. ""Actually, the drugs pay for the rehab""  So we knowingly allow people to get addicted to then go and pay for them to go to rehab?  Rehab is really expensive.  Especially if we don't have any negative consequences for addicts and there is no incentive to stay clean.  The taxes from drugs will never be able to pay for the total cost of rehab.  ""Take that massive markup and spend it in the community. Fix the cause of the problems and you fix the problem""  You can't legislate against poor lifestyle choices, poor parenting, and a whole host of reasons why people will willingly ingest illegal drugs on a regular basis.    I'm all for giving people the right to make poor decisions like using cocaine or heroin.  I'm just not willing to pay for the consequences.  IE: you should pay for your own medical expenses regarding rehab/getting clean.  ""Colorado has had a huge boost to its education budget by taking any taxes from weed sales and pumping them back into the community.""  Do you mean an increase in drug-related hospitalizations?  http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/18/marijuana-related-hospitalizations-spike-in-colora/  I also wonder how many brain cells have been lost through the legalization of weed and if it really is a net benefit.  ""Again, incorrect. Young people who have ready access to hard drugs are far more likely to take up something on a whim, than an adult who has to make a conscious decision to take heroin.""  Do you have proof of this?  I know many people that wouldn't even know where to get hard drugs.  However, if you could get it everywhere, they would definitely try it at some point.  Lots of people feel like if the government endorses it, it must be 'safe'.  The other problem is tort reform.  People have been suing the cigarette companies for decades even though it's been known to cause cancer since the 1960s (and stated on every box).   We would need new laws passed where you couldn't sue the government or any company that sells these drugs for health-related injuries.  Otherwise, no company would be willing to sell due to the liability and the taxpayers would be footing the bill of the resulting lawsuits.  It can take $100 Million dollars and a decade to get a new drug on the market in the US with FDA approval.  It has to go through lots of clinical trials to make sure it's safe.    Do you honestly think in this sort of climate that we would ever be able to have your delusional fantasy of all drugs legalized?  You just want it legalized so you can get convenient and cheap drugs.  You don't really care about the actual consequences this may have on the rest of society and it's pretty damn selfish.    ""Today, any person, regardless of their age or where they are in the world, can have hard drugs any time they want because the current tactics are working so well /s.""  What's your point?  I might have made this argument when I was 13.  ""Still, probable that there is no convincing the right. The failing war will continue to fail for decades to come until people finally realised that doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result is utter madness.""  The problem is that the Left wants their cake and eat it too.  You are describing a scenario where people willingly get themselves addicted and me, the taxpayer, pays for clean needles and expensive rehab.    You might be able to win the war on drugs if I didn't have to pay for your poor life decisions.  I refuse to pay for a junkie that goes through rehab 7 times and never has a reason to stop shooting up.  I suppose I should be happy.  More drug users/pot heads just means less competition for me in my profession.    I've worked with many and they usually don't last long or get passed up for promotions due to their love of smoking.  It also completely kills ambition.  I've had friends that tell me they can never find a job..it's usually the weed.  They would rather watch cartoons and smoke weed on the couch all day then try to get an interview. ""The key is to drop the drug price below the black market. There is a certain tipping point where it would no longer be be worth the risk for drug dealers to sell drugs on the black market.""  This will never happen.  A regular market will always have taxes and regulations, which increases the cost of the product.  The black market can always get around this by ignoring taxes and regulations and charging less.  ""who gives a fuck as long as they aren't hurting anyone else? Why should you (or anybody else) be making lifestyle choices for anybody else? ""  I start caring when I have to pay for higher healthcare costs (which is a direct result from long-term drug use).  ""Some guy doing blow in a bathroom at a club, or dropping acid in their apartment, or doing molly at a rave isn't going to negatively impact your life anymore than someone getting drunk at a bar and minding their own business.""  Like I stated above, minding your own business is fine.  It's when you start pushing for paid rehab, free needles, and the other things that come out of my pocket where it starts to be a problem for me. We're talking JUST about drug cartels in this thread. Talking about protection rackets or any other types of gangs is a really obvious red herring. I can use violence, but I don't. So there must be another factor. With the latter you won't be prosecuted for doing something illegal.  With the first one there can be actual legal support for you if you do it.   If we take prostitution as an example: Decriminalised prostitution means that prostitution isn't legal, but everyone involved won't be prosecuted.   If it's made legal then a prostitute could seek legal profession when shit hits the fan during work like going to the police. This is very true, and probably the second biggest obstacle to decriminalization next  to greed.  Well Trump is our new President. That was a massive hit to a lot things And hash. We want hash too.  Either way, gonna take a massive hit. Yeah? Let's see what happens after they discuss NAFTA.  If Mexico and Canada teamed up...oh boy...we'd really be hoping those protestors down in the States would hold off an invasion :o Fuck that, Canada shouldn't be the political bitch of the U.S. I disagree. Portugal probably would have legalized all drugs if the results were more promising, but they haven't been. Decriminalization has had [mixed results](http://www.npr.org/2011/01/20/133086356/Mixed-Results-For-Portugals-Great-Drug-Experiment), and so it's unlikely they would ever think of taking it further to legalization. And that I agree with, but a lot of people in this thread seem to think drugs should be 100% legal. You are referring to just weed, the post above refers to all drugs, up to and including meth. There are no meth cafes in Denver, right? Lol Dutch person here. Our drug policy right now is far from perfect. Even though weed is decriminalised, medicinal weed is still not really recognised legally, even if we produce medicinal weed for other countries (in a really weird and inconsistent system).  Yeah, you know what is a great country to emulate? China! Nothing going wrong there.  I like this idea.  No, not for everything, but it is for drugs. If a person absolutely insists, then it doesn't really matter whether or not you deny them; right?   But I agree that education is the best defense against drug abuse, and not just the overly simplistic ""Just Say No"", but actually demonstrating the effects (positive and negative) of  different drugs. The same issue is had with sexual education in certain places, but that's a different topic.  I think opioids are such a major problem in America because people are only now realizing how devastating they can be since the effects weren't discussed extensively in, at least not in any class I've ever had.  That being said, *because* I know about the effects methamphetamine can have on a person, you could open a ""Meth Caf"" right next to my house and I'd never walk through their door. Yes, you should be allowed to. Assuming you can prove you're actually capable to make the decision. And that is currently the state of the law in Canada.  Yes, my job of healing people's illnesses is definitely incompatible with not wanting to be the one approving their recreational decisions. Those two things are inextricably related.  If you could buy clean heroin over the counter, nobody would want fentanyl. The reason it's hitting the streets is that it's easy to make, not because it's a more desired product.   Yes, and people die of alcohol poisoning by the thousands each year.  Doesn't mean prohibition is better. No doctor would ever agree to this, the risks are just too great, at least in Canada. An accidental overdose could result in their license being revoked, so why would they take such a risk just so another person could have a good time? This is a terrible idea. We already have a shortage of doctors, and you're describing a very high legal risk, very high work load system.  A source please? Or are you just talking out your ass  Ah, I see. At the same time though, we do see some softening in the anti-drug rhetoric coming alongside the widespread prescription painkiller crisis. During the campaign, for instance, I recall that Bill Clinton at one point called it a national tragedy, plaguing the lives of millions Americans - a far cry from the War on Drugs era rhetoric. As drug use becomes widespread among whites, it becomes less of a menace to society and more of a tragedy.   Perhaps both renouncing the war on drugs and expanding national healthcare services could be cast as a new New Deal to Americans. But you're right, that anything short of that would sputter out on the remaining anti-drug prejudice in the US.    Cheaper but fraught with legal danger. However you have to factor the potential legal consequences into the buying illegally. Plus the weed experience is a lot cooler in weed shops. Pot is still highly prohibited. We do have plenty of evidence. Look at the prices of alcohol, coffee and aspirin. Who cares if 50k people die by overdoses a year. We can probably aggregate all sports and recreational activities and find the same stats. There's nearly 7 bill people and 350 mill in America. We live in a semi-free society, there are risks to living, the primary one being death. What's a lot worse than the risk of death is having a lack of autonomy. > Then they're stupid or extremely biased. It's a special case of the AlchianAllen effect and it pretty much follows straight from very simple supply and demand calculations. On top of that the empirical studies done on the subject show pretty much unilateral support for it. I'd be happy to see a study that shows the opposite if you have one.  Well, apparently the author of the book you referenced used it as an argument for legalization of marijuana, [arguing that marijuana legalization would reduce hard drug use](http://endingcannabisprohibition.yuku.com/topic/634/HOW-THE-NARCS-CREATED-CRACK-by-Richard-C-Cowan#.WJFzRVMrKM9). And considering marijuana is effectively legal in most of Canada, especially BC where fentanyl use is soaring, something's wrong with the ""Iron Law of Prohibition"".  > There's a reason it's America that has a huge Fentanyl problem and not Europe.  Estonia has some of the most relaxed drug laws in Europe, with many drugs decriminalized and users typically just incurring a small fine, and yet [fentanyl is a serious problem drug in the country](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17524945).  > I'm not saying legal drugs are without problems. I'm saying prohibition makes the problems worse.  And I disagree, I think it depends on the drug.  Another example, as I pointed out elsewhere, is meth. The drug itself doesn't cause a whole lot of direct harm to users, provided they don't overdose on it, so there isn't much room for improvement with regulated (or free market) legalization. But users can sometimes go for a month or so without sleeping if they're using regularly, and the sleep deprivation causes a whole host of physical and mental problems that can be permanent. > You mean Adderall?  No, I mean meth, speed, etc.  > And yet you could furnish no example. (Please correct me if I'm wrong and you have an example/support of things getting much, much worse after legalization of a controlled substance.)  I provided an example when discussing meth, and you erroneously wrote off as an example of another drug altogether.  > Even if you're not religious, you suggest failure. You suggest atrocity. You suggest throwing addicts in prison for being addicts and for no other reason. This is how prohibition works. It doesn't stop the behavior it claims to stop.  This is just rhetoric, and a dishonest portrayal of my views.  > Legalization, regulation, and a system of support for those that fall will do more good, cause less damage, and cost less by far.  I'm fine with providing support to users. But for more dangerous drugs manufacture and sale should still be prosecuted in my opinion.  > And the only reason we don't do this, is because for some reason, ""getting high"" is a bad thing while ""getting drunk"" tends to be socially acceptable up until you hurt someone as a result.  No, this is a straw man argument entirely of your own design.. Society has to deal with the fallout for certain hard drugs. There is a financial cost, and society has the right to attempt to minimize that, even if it's through decriminalization for users.  > I simply suggest parity.   I appreciate the apology.  It's worth mentioning that legalization doesn't inherently mean criminals would no longer benefit from sales. For example, both olive oil and asbestos are legal substances, although the latter is controlled, and both industries are largely controlled by criminal enterprise. I'm not sure about the latter, but the former has even resulted in violence (yes, I'm talking about the olive oil you use in cooking).  I'm not sure what it's like in USA, but in Canada fentanyl is being brought in by the triads. And they aren't fighting with each other to do so. The Hell's Angels (their competitors) seem to have kept their hands off of fentanyl, and there is no gang war to speak of. Things have been quite since the 2008 economic crisis, which was the largest cause of gang violence in the last 20 years or so.  > It's easier to die when you don't know the purity of your drug, it's a given, esp if it's cut with fentanyl, that's been the cause of the increased spike in opiate ODs in the states. Make it legal and allow nestle or some company like bayer to sell it and you will see a dramatic decrease in drug death.  I disagree. [People knowingly abuse fentanyl and still overdose](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/the-new-face-of-fentanyl-addiction-kati-s-story-1.3766697). Legalization won't change that, it will just make it easier to get a hold of.  > People will have time to get their life back together. Most addicts are not trying to kill themselves, they have families and loved ones and often have jobs. They are sick individuals who deserve compassion, not the hammer.  I should emphasize that I do not agree with persecuting users. As far as I'm concerned users have a health problem. Manufacturers and dealers of certain hard drugs however are creating serious social problems that the rest of society is forced to deal with, in my opinion, and these people should be persecuted by law. Meth is a good example. Keeping production illegal increases fire hazards, I agree. Making it legal make however increases ease of access, and it's an addictive drug that seriously disrupts sleep, which can result in permanent physical and mental problems. You want less fire hazards, I get that, but I'm not as worried about that and want less schizophrenics to deal with, can you understand that? The law the Harper government passed forces fixed election cycles on other parties. The party in power can still dissolve parliament for early elections.  Big sugar did legitimate damage to the health of millions in north america with their insidious lobbying and biased studies.  To that note, sugar is still one of the few items on a nutrional label that has a daily recommended intake that isn't labelled as a %. Guess who's behind that little misleading piece of information, you only find out guidelines for that via official channels after you've begun showing signs of diabetes. A common problem with those two drugs (meth and fentanyl) is that they're often used as cutting agents in other drugs. Perhaps legalization of those other drugs could reduce the demand for them.  Alright, so let's say that does happen and there is an option to buy clean heroin. What's the motivation for regular gang bangers to stop selling their own homemade heroin? Wouldn't a safer, government regulated version be watered down, or whatever term fits? Wouldn't people seeking a better high just go to the local drug dealers? new york city was gentrified by a bunch of white people moving in and replacing the population that was burned out I'm talking about before the first conviction. or just find an older friend who also doesn't care about contributing to the delinquency of minors, it's not that hard.  ps. oh wait it's almost like finding a drug dealer. No one's misconceived. Everyone knows alcohol is a drug, a socially acceptable one like coffee and Viagra. When people do stupid things and injure or kill themselves, their relatives cry about it and cry for change.  Society doesn't have the stomach to tell them to piss off and let their friend or relatives kill themselves. Ideally yeah, we'd need no police or laws or regulations at all, everyone can just pull thier shit together. I think we leave these kinda laws in because the damage the stupid or young individual can do to themselves and society is too great. I agree alot of drugs shouldn't fall in this category, like weed and maybe some hallocenogenics.  Yea, a cooling off period so you can think about whether or not you want to fuck your life up. There are people that work in the addiction recovery field that place alcohol in the same realm as heroin and meth. Especially when it comes to affecting people around you. 2 or 3 beers a few times a week. That is more than most people would do cocaine, for example, so why is alcohol not a hard drug? Saying something is 'hard' because of its addictive nature is odd though, sugar would be a hard drug by that standard. Do you know how ridiculously cheap it is to make shitnlike heroin or meth at an industrial scale? Illicit producers would never be able to beat it. Ever notice how nobody is making big bucks from moonshine anymore? There's a reason for that. Just look at how things are going in states with legal weed. Prices are coming down, and fewer and fewer people are willing to go through the hassle of getting weed the old fashioned way. Change doesn't happen overnight, but it is happening.  >I start caring when I have to pay for higher healthcare costs (which is a direct result from long-term drug use).  Who exactly do you think is paying for them right now? The only difference is that we're paying for prison cells instead of just rehab.  Would you rather pay for someone to have their life ruined (and possibly forced into crime just to get by) or pay for rehab and get them to be productive members of society?   Some people will always do drugs. Putting them in a jail cell has done absolutely nothing to help society. Doing the same exact thing over and over and expecting different results is absolute stupidity Drug cartels exist in Latin American and do business through regional gangs.  In Canada the big ones are Italians and Hell's Angels.  Every single city has some level of FOB gangs and aboriginal gangs.  If we're only looking to cut out the Mexican drug cartels that do little business in Canada, well that's easy you just have stronger enforcement.  However making it legal in Canada doesn't cut them out of the picture because it is illegal to transport these materials across international waters and through the United States.  Who are we talking about RCMP arresting if not locals?  Why would you suddenly switch gangs to meaning the cartels? The pursuit of power and greed.   Distribution remains  illegal. Intent to sell, illegal. Creating, illegal.   I do agree that the punishments should be more geared towards rehabilitation. Some can't be, those need to be monitored and isolated.  Also the manufacturers of the 'good' drugs (which kill far more people than all illegal drugs combined) have big interests in keeping illegal drugs where they are. Believe me, we're bitching and moaning to each other on FB and in the office every day, but we won't give that leash too much slack. There are like 13 or 14 northern states that really rely on us, and we really rely on you guys for trade, so I don't think we're in any position to do anything drastic. Trudeau wants the Keystone pipeline, so that doesn't hurt anything, but this whole immigration ban does not sit well with him. Going to be a weird few years.  To be honest this is what gives me hope for Mexico to try auch thing, if Latinamerica as a whole did it we would be one step closer to becoming a regional powerhouse. Drugs drains way too many resources when in the end the majority of them are meant for the US. And shrooms Diplomacy is not the same thing as kneeling over. The American military is the reason we don't belong to Russia. It's a relationship and there is compromise.  Fair enough They're a problem because they're now hard to get and the crap you get on the street isn't consistent.  Physically, they're pretty harmless. > Yes, and people die of alcohol poisoning by the thousands each year. Doesn't mean prohibition is better.  This argument doesn't suggest it's any worse either. To prevent ostracizing drug users from society, and creating a national crises.  I'm fine with drug users being solely responsible for overdose while filling a *recreational prescription*. I just want to establish a legal method by which people can do all drugs in safety under appropriate supervision.   I'm pretty much down for anything, like requiring regular therapy to get access to hard drugs. I don't do them myself, but I don't want addicts to suffer. History? Drug use constantly goes up when access increases. Just about every drug trend you can think of has had exactly that happen. Pick a drug and it's happened. Most recently people started using opioids a lot more when doctors started prescribing them far more readily. Where do you think this opioid epidemic people talk of came from?  Just look at alcohol and tobacco. > Well, apparently the author of the book you referenced used it as an argument for legalization of marijuana, arguing that marijuana legalization would reduce hard drug use. And considering marijuana is effectively legal in most of Canada, especially BC where fentanyl use is soaring, something's wrong with the ""Iron Law of Prohibition"".  That only prooves that marijuana and fentanyl are not perfect substitution goods. If you were to legalize opiates you would see far better results.  >Estonia has some of the most relaxed drug laws in Europe,  Huh? Based on what?  >And I disagree, I think it depends on the drug.  The thing I'm trying to explain is that prohibition affects the choices of drugs as well. Even drug users by and large want safer drugs. They're not primarily looking for risk, but for a high. They're however willing to take risks in order to get their high. A big problem is that prohibition skewes the risk/reward ratio towards more potent drugs that otherwise wouldn't be as appealing. > No, I mean meth, speed, etc.  Dude, Adderall is a methamphetamine salt. It's literally ""meth, speed, etc..""  >I provided an example when discussing meth, and you erroneously wrote off as an example of another drug altogether.  I'll repeat, there are legal forms of meth. See above.  >This is just rhetoric, and a dishonest portrayal of my views.  No. It's the reality played out by following your views. ""Those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it"" and all.  >I'm fine with providing support to users. But for more dangerous drugs manufacture and sale should still be prosecuted in my opinion.  You cannot provide support to those that break the law. You put them in jail. Do you think a meth addict gets the support he needs in jail?  >Society has to deal with the fallout for certain hard drugs. There is a financial cost, and society has the right to attempt to minimize that, even if it's through decriminalization for users.  So still prosecute ""dangerous drugs"" manufacture and sale up until the point we can show that legalization would reduce the cost to society for those drugs?  You know what? I agree with that. Now, I wonder if there's historical precedent of something people considered a ""dangerous drug"" and some before it was illegal, during illegal, and post illegal cost on society numbers....  Because I do believe, numbers wise, legalization is ALWAYS cheaper on society than prohibition. But production will always be illegal, even if doing meth isn't illegal. It will likely also not be legal to sell it in stores because it's a terrible bathtub drug.  Users will use regardless of law. They deserve help not criminal records. If they commit crimes while on it then they should be charged with committing a crime while under the influence. Well, nobody is stopping anyone now. Legalization at least gives the option. It's not black and white but what you're describing is still a safer scenario than what is currently established. Perhaps, yes. But my point was intended to point out the casual use of the phrase ""literally destroyed by drugs"".  This also applies to people stealing liquor. In Ontario, Liquor bottles have locks on them that trigger alarms when taken out of the store due to thef concerns. not sure why you were downvoted. I got paid when i turned 18 to buy smokes and booze for younger friends. and i took like 20-30% service fee. once i pocketed 10 dollars for a 8 dollar mickey, so it can be profitable for after counter market sales in teenagers. Just because a drug is socially acceptable doesn't make it harmless. I think if we want to deal with the issue of harms in a scientific manner, then all drugs should be up for inspection, including alcohol. Not all drugs are going to fuck up your life though. There's a big difference between heroin and LSD or shrooms.  But yeah I think the wait period could be used to research what they are about to put into their body. Maybe make them take a test on the long term side effects/dangers of the drugs? Yup, especially because it can usually increase agressive behavior in people.   Personal anecdote:  I was watching a movie once by myself, and having a drink. I have only been drinking for two years and accidentally went over my limit. When I woke up, everything was trashed, I had broken appliences, my laptop, the oven. Never even been remotely close to this state of impairment with weed, coke, or hallucinogens. I'm just happy there weren't other's around. Let's say drugs are legal in canada tomorrow.  Who is in the best position to manufacture and distribute drugs on a large scale? It's not the hell angels my friend, it's the established pot farms and pharmaceutical companies who have the greatest productive capacity and distribution networks.  Why would a producer in Latin America hire gangs to transport and distribute his product when he could hire a shipping company at a fraction of the cost and risk?  Why would anyone buy heroin cut with god-knows-what from a shady dealer, when they could walk into a Shoppers and get pure, medical grade heroin for a fraction of the cost of street junk?  Now let's say the gangs that derived their income from drugs decide to go legit. Why on earth would they risk their freedom and their businesses by resolving thefts and disputes with their competition through violence? The courts and law enforcement exist as a peaceful avenue for the resolution of disputes and the administration of justice. Moreover, being legitimate entities, they would be able to buy insurance.  Now will legalization stop all criminal distribution of drugs? As you pointed out, there will still be smuggling into countries where drus remain illegal. However, that is a symptom of a lack of universal legalization. Universal legalization would eliminate the drugs black market entirely and instantly. I mean your PM probably already pissed Donnie Lil'hands off with that impassioned refugee speech so he can't do any worse than that. >There are like 13 or 14 northern states that really rely on us, and we really rely on you guys for trade  What if--and I'm just putting this out there--those states seceded from the United States, formed our own country, elected Bernie Sanders as our first President, and forged an alliance with Canada?  Wouldn't we all be better off?  The knuckle-dragging fools can have their Trumptopia. We'll go our own way, thank you very much.     And blackjack and hookers. The United State's ignorance will not impact the aid the government will give to it's citizens, ever. The reason we don't belong to Russia, is because Russia has never wanted us. Fighting over Alaska or Antarctica is not the same as wanting Canadian land. It's extremely unlikely you'd be able to demonstrate that you were capable of making that decision and also want to kill yourself, given that it's a decision wherein psychiatric depression precludes competency. Your example of a perfectly healthy, competent eighteen year old who wants suicide is therefore a strawman. However if theoretically such a person could exist, then yes, that walking paradox has the right to choose what happens with his or her life. Including ending it. It's not your choice to make for them.  Right, my two sentence comment is not a comprehensive argument on why legalization is better. > To prevent ostracizing drug users from society, and creating a national crises.  This sentiment does not necessitate legalization specifically. Decriminalization would likely be just as effective in this regard.  > I'm fine with drug users being solely responsible for overdose while filling a *recreational prescription*. I just want to establish a legal method by which people can do all drugs in safety under appropriate supervision.  You may be fine with this, but the point is many doctors -- the ""appropriate supervision"" you're referring to -- aren't. This is clear considering support *among doctors* for safe injection sites is disputed across Canada, for example.  > I'm pretty much down for anything, like requiring regular therapy to get access to hard drugs. I don't do them myself, but I don't want addicts to suffer.  Addiction itself a form of suffering. This isn't rhetoric, we're talking about products that diminish free will and in some cases, as I mentioned earlier with respect to meth, disrupt sleep and other biological processes necessary for mental health. > recreational prescription  There's no such thing lol, that's the point. If it's recreational then you don't have doctors signing off on it saying that it's necessary.  It's like alcohol or so tobacco, you don't get prescriptions for those. > To prevent ostracizing drug users from society  The whole point of legalizing drugs is so that we can legitimately ostracize drug users. Much like how smokers are being ostracized. > If you were to legalize opiates you would see far better results.  You're assuming opiates are perfect substitute drugs, and I would argue because they carry a much greater risk of death they are not.  > Huh? Based on what?  [See here](http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/countries/estonia). Dealing is illegal, but use is typically met with a fine.  > The thing I'm trying to explain is that prohibition affects the choices of drugs as well. Even drug users by and large want safer drugs. They're not primarily looking for risk, but for a high. They're however willing to take risks in order to get their high. A big problem is that prohibition skewes the risk/reward ratio towards more potent drugs that otherwise wouldn't be as appealing.  And the thing I'm trying to explain is that certain drugs don't become safer when legalized, such as fentanyl and meth. I'm all for legally selling drugs with a low risk of death, permanent schizophrenia, etc. But drugs with higher risks carry with them higher social and financial costs for society, as it's usually others that have to deal with the fallout. > Dude, Adderall is a methamphetamine salt. It's literally ""meth, speed, etc..""  Actually, Adderall is an **[amphetamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adderall)**. It's not part of the [**meth**amphetamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) methyl group that crystal meth/speed belongs to. They're similar in the same sense that watching a cheap porno on your cell phone and having sex with your flesh and blood girlfriend are similar.  > I'll repeat, there are legal forms of meth.  No, it's really not.  > You cannot provide support to those that break the law. You put them in jail. Do you think a meth addict gets the support he needs in jail?  I don't advocate placing *users* in jail, only dealers and manufacturers.  > So still prosecute ""dangerous drugs"" manufacture and sale up until the point we can show that legalization would reduce the cost to society for those drugs?  In short, yes.  > Because I do believe, numbers wise, legalization is ALWAYS cheaper on society than prohibition.  Having lived in an area where crystal meth was, for all intents and purposes, readily available without risk of prosecution, I'm inclined to disagree. Sorry, I think I misunderstood you're last post. You and I are on the same page, I agree that users should be treated like a health problem, not criminals. Putting users in jail is stupid. Hard drugs, like meth, should be illegal to manufacture and sell.  But unfortunately I must inform you that this statement...  > I don't think most people who want to legalize drugs are saying people should be able to produce meth in their own homes.  ...is wrong. I've been arguing with quite a few people on this subject who strongly believe all drugs should be legal for both consumption and production. No one's saying they shouldn't... In fact,if you read what I was saying I see the root problems to almost all drugs being the poor social infrastructure. Hence, improve that, fix problem. IF we are talking about making all drugs legal let's level, the coca plant is illegal to ship by UN resolution.  If a coca plant, seed or any segment of it were to enter international waters or through another sovereign country it would be seized.  There is no legal way to have legal cocaine in Canada without involving the black market.  Do you really think pharmaceutical companies are going to want to deal with the cartel?  Of course not, and if Shoppers sold cocaine to anyone at all they would be boycotted by their loyal shoppers. So you will need gangs and gangs don't compete like Shoppers does by lowering their prices or providing a superior product, they fuck people up. Have you looked at an election map?  Outside of a few dozen inner cities new york and the three west coast states no one supports the democrats.  Theres literally a half dozen counties on the Canadian border that support clinton total and you expect them to be with you in secession?  They would be first in line to kill you for trying.  And you claim they're the idiots lol. With trump at the wheel, I think something like that would result in a very long nuclear winter. You could just be part of Canada. Might as well stay in the G7. Trudeau isn't perfect, but at least we elected someone in their early 40s. It was hyperbole, I'm just saying we rely on their protection if it ever came to it. That's a good counterpoint, I'm merely advocating for drastic solutions because the problem seems overwhelming.   Again, just looking to provide a legal framework that would encourage drug users to make regular contact with medical professionals. I'm a big fan of the carrot over the stick. > You're assuming opiates are perfect substitute drugs, and I would argue because they carry a much greater risk of death they are not.  No, I'm just assuming they are better substitution goods than marijuana and opiates, as in the highs are closer.  The risk of death is irrelevant in this respect. People are buying drugs to get high, not to die. When they compare drugs, they primarily compare the high, not the risk. It's the high that makes the user determine how close two drugs are. Once they have decided what kind of high they want, they compare other factors such as price and risk, but those are secondary.  > See here. Dealing is illegal, but use is typically met with a fine.  That's not even close to enough to make it have ""some of the most relaxed drug laws in Europe."" Maybe that sounds extremely liberal for american ears, but to a european that is pretty much expected as standard. I can't think of any european country that actually jaills users. That may not even enough to put it in the top half (not saying they're not in the top half, just saying that the fact they only fine users is not enough info to place them there since that's pretty much all countries in Europe). > They're similar in the same sense that watching a cheap porno on your cell phone and having sex with your flesh and blood girlfriend are similar.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_and_culture_of_substituted_amphetamines  Or, they're 2 different forms of largely the same thing with a vast amount of similarity of response and affects.  >I don't advocate placing users in jail, only dealers and manufacturers.  So make possession and use legal and criminalize production and sale? This is called ""decriminalization"" and doesn't work. Demand is kept steady or increases a bit since people think it's ok after decriminalization and creates scenarios where the user is now used by law enforcement to find the supplies. This results in atrocity.  >Having lived in an area where crystal meth was, for all intents and purposes, readily available without risk of prosecution, I'm inclined to disagree.  Actually living where ""top of the world"" was used to describe us for it, we are no longer, and we're still here.  >Methamphetamine is FDA approved for the treatment of ADHD and exogenous obesity. It is dispensed in the USA under the trademark name Desoxyn[14] and manufactured by Ovation Pharmaceuticals.[15] The levorotary form of methamphetamine, levomethamphetamine, is an over-the-counter drug used as in nasal decongestants such as Vicks VapoInhaler.[16]  You simply do not know what you're talking about. I think that's part of a solution. One of the main problems with how to manage drugs in society is the governments refusal to acknowledge the evidence. We saw it with [Prof. David Nutt being sacked by his govt when he stated the results of their drug harms study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npeUYNv8gto). We also see it with the [DEA's refusal to change policies to fit the data](http://ijr.com/opinion/2016/10/260813-medical-marijuana-illegal-dea/). But the good news is that things are changing despite all the resistence. You are right.  The big cities do tend to be the major Democratic strongholds.  They are blue islands in a sea of red.  But simply painting counties some color of red/purple/blue oversimplifies the issue.  There are nuances of ideology across the United States which pretty pictures cannot capture.  Let me give you an example.  Conservatives in the Northeast are much different than conservatives in the South.  For one thing, we tend not to bible-thump.  Most rural Northern conservatives don't care what you do with your own time, so long as it doesn't hurt them or their families: ""Stay out of my business and I'll stay out of yours.""  We tend to support conservation of natural resources (something you'd usually expect to see in more liberal folks), because poisoning the land and water and air is not good for business.  It's not good for anyone, really.  The rural counties of the North didn't so much vote *for* Donald Trump as they voted *against* Hilary Clinton, because to us, it seemed pretty likely that she would continue the modern Federal tradition of meddling in people's business, stealing their money, and sending Northerners off to die in stupid, wasteful wars in the desert.  A lot of people around here chafe at the knowledge that our lives are ruled by people a thousand miles away who seem not to give a shit about us.  Bernie Sanders gives a shit about us, but Hilary Clinton robbed him of the nomination.  I remind you that the Democratic primary map for New York looked like [this](http://imgur.com/3p2UfZH), and that westernmost block is blue by less than half a percent.  Bernie won Vermont 86-13, New Hampshire 60-38, and Maine 64-35.  He also won Rhode Island and the rural areas of Connecticut and Massachusetts.  So yeah, I do think a lot of people around here outside the cities (and even some in them) would be down for secession. With respect, the bigger the country, the more likely it is that terrible people will rise to rule it.  Accountability is better served by keeping nations small.  Further, a large nation will also trend toward cultural homogeneity, and this is no good either.  California is beautiful place with nice people living there, but they have their own culture--their own way of doing things--which is distinct from the culture we have in the Northeast.  (I think it has to do with climate; if the Earth is trying to kill you for six months out of the year, you have to struggle to keep yourself warm and sheltered.  Not so in California, which is why Californians are very laid-back and Yankees work hard, talk fast, etc.  [No time to waste. Winter is coming.])  It's sort of like Jefferson's ""laboratories of democracy"" idea.  Each nation should have the opportunity to conduct itself the way it wishes, in keeping with its own culture.  But certainly our nations should be friends, since our general goals do align with each other pretty well.  There's no reason we can't have mutually-beneficial treaties with one another.  Plus, the more flags flying outside the HQ of the North American Alliance, the prettier it looks.    Except it's BS. What country wants to take Canadian or would likely ever attack Canada? The most likely answer would be the U.S. more than any other country. Just saying we shouldn't rely on them, they shouldn't affect us at all politically. On this, I agree. Although I'm opposed to legalizing hard drugs, mainly because the fallout from these drugs is a lot for society to deal with, I do think the best way to combat use is provide social support. Putting users in jail is just stupid. > https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_and_culture_of_substituted_amphetamines  > Or, they're 2 different forms of largely the same thing with a vast amount of similarity of response and affects.  They have similar effects, but there are some stark differences. They're different methyl groups, and your link doesn't dispute this. Furthrmore, when you said ""adderall is a methamphetamine salt"" you were, quite frankly, wrong.  > So make possession and use legal and criminalize production and sale? This is called ""decriminalization"" and doesn't work. Demand is kept steady or increases a bit since people think it's ok after decriminalization and creates scenarios where the user is now used by law enforcement to find the supplies. This results in atrocity.  Decriminalization is working pretty well in Portugal, the evidence is pretty clear on this.  >  Actually living where ""top of the world"" was used to describe us for it, we are no longer, and we're still here.  I'm not sure what you're referring to, but okay.  > > Methamphetamine is FDA approved for the treatment of ADHD and exogenous obesity. It is dispensed in the USA under the trademark name Desoxyn[14] and manufactured by Ovation Pharmaceuticals.[15] The levorotary form of methamphetamine, levomethamphetamine, is an over-the-counter drug used as in nasal decongestants such as Vicks VapoInhaler.[16]  > You simply do not know what you're talking about.  Says the guy that is purposely conflating Adderall with Desoxyn (the latter of which is a different form of meth than the street drug too).  **EDIT:** By your reasoning, various beers and distilled liquors, and certain engine fuels for both cars and rockets, and various kinds of antifreeze, solvents and sugar products all have similar effects on the human body and brain because they are all alcohols of some kind. It's absurd. Can't agree more. What happened to Nutt was a disgrace and alcohol is a far more dangerous drug than most. My own personal hatred is reserved for tobacco. The most pointless drug out there. Incredible damage, horrifically addictive and almost no payoff other than to feel kinda normal for a while (but actually a kinda crap, out of breath, stinky normal). If there is one drug the world could do without, that's it. Go ahead and try.  I guarantee you will fail. >By your reasoning, various beers and distilled liquors, and certain engine fuels for both cars and rockets, and various kinds of antifreeze, solvents and sugar products all have similar effects on the human body and brain because they are all alcohols of some kind.  If you're ignoring the fact that the effects of meth and those legal forms ARE the same. Legalization would cause the more caustic variations to fall away in favor of the safer forms. Kind of like how you may still be able to find alcohol brewed in a bathtub, but it's not really all that common as far safer forms exist. Also, be careful with your comparisons.  >Decriminalization is working pretty well in Portugal, the evidence is pretty clear on this.  You think? Really? Decriminalization is work compared to prohibition? No kidding? Of course it does. When you compare it to outright prohibition. When compared to full legalization, back to failure.  >Says the guy that is purposely conflating Adderall with Desoxyn (the latter of which is a different form of meth than the street drug too).  It's also legal meth.

"2",1,"5rb1qz","2017-01-31","I think bombing the shit out of their home countries and killing thousands of innocents over the last 15 years is better propaganda than anything else Trump does.  Edit: I did not mean to imply Trump isn't also bombing them. He is. The executive order specifically mentions 9/11. 15 out of 19 of the 9/11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia. The executive order does not apply to Saudi Arabia. In fact, the EO doesn't apply to ANY of the countries the highjackers came from (UAE, Egypt and Lebanon were also left off the list.)  THIS IS LITERALLY EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS GODDAMN ""EXECUTIVE ORDER"". [Word cloud out of all the comments.](http://i.imgur.com/5groJ3k.png)  I hope you like it Everything the United States does is a ""propaganda oppurtunity"" for the Islamic State...  A more effective tool than dropping drone strikes on civilians?  ""Criticizing these people only emboldens them!""  What horrible, flawed, manipulative, disingenuous, reasoning. >We shouldn't defend ourselves, our enemy might get the wrong idea and be offended!  ~ this sub I didnt vote for Trump. I dont even particularly like him, so its been odd lately that Ive been put in the precarious position of defending him. This isnt a Muslim ban. Malaysia, Indonesia, Egypt, Bangladesh, Turkey, Pakistan, (and we could keep going) arent banned. Its a ban from seven countries that are considered potential security threats. Furthermore, these were countries specifically picked by the Obama Administration. Here are the countries that have been banned: Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Libya, Sudan, and Iran. Now here is a list of countries Obama bombed: Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Libya, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Notice some overlap?   And Ill just reiterate, it was Obama that named these countries security threats, and nobody complained when he banned Iraqis, many of whom served with our military as interpreters, for six months during his tenure. Should it have applied to people who had already had visas and legal green cards? No, of course not. It was misinterpreted, and a judge got that sorted, and the authorities are complying with the judicial order. The system worked the way it was supposed to. Is it unconstitutional? No, actually it isnt. Obama did it. Jimmy Carter did it. Both Democrats. Furthermore, all of these countries that Trump banned have standing bans on other countries themselves.   The fact is that any country has the right to ban citizens of any other country. You dont have a right to go to someone elses country anymore than they have a right to just go to America. In America, this discretion is given to the president to ban people from nations that are considered a security threat since presumably he has access to all the classified data we dont. And in this case, these were all countries Obama considered a security threat also.   The fact is that the Mainstream Media is obviously out to demonize Trump right now and have been for the last year, and theyre trading their credibility for views instead of just reporting the truth. I dont particularly think this ban is a good idea myself, but it is a far cry from the hyperbolic propaganda that the media is railing about. If the act of banning them turns them into violent militants, then shouldn't we have banned them in the first place? What's to stop them from being radicalized after they enter US borders if they're so susceptible to that way of thinking?  I feel like the UK home secretary missed the mark on this one. ""Brother, our soldiers are depleted - we need a new recruitment video!""  ""Okay - how about 'Infidels martyring 45,000 of our ISIS brethren over the last 8 years'?""  ""Boring""  ""100s of innocents killed by the serpent US under Obama in drone strikes? (complete with dead baby pictures)?""  Yawn  ...  ...  ""My brother can't visit Disneyland for at least 6 months?""  ""ROLL THAT TAPE"" Don't fight back against terror. It might make more terror. If you kill them. They win.  Really reddit?  This is what you're fucking doing now?  EVERYTHING WE DO IS PROPAGANDA FOR ISIS.  This website is the fucking worst. >""Islam has nothing to do with terrorism so don't ban people from those countries or else terrorism will go up""  lel I forgot we're supposed to be bending over backwards pleasing isis Is there any action the U.S. could take to protect itself from terrorism that couldn't be used as propaganda by terrorists? Sorry but no one is radicalized because they can't enter another country. How stupid does that sound? They are radicalized when they hear that the western world allows boys to enter women's restrooms, it allows people to choose their gender, and it removes the name of God from the majority of it's institutions.  All 7 Muslim countries banned jews from Israel a while back. Where were the protests back then? 'Donald Trump's US acceptance of homosexuals could become a ""propaganda opportunity"" for so-called Islamic State, the UK's home secretary has warned', would not be an acceptable reason to denounce pro-LGBT actions. So how is this a valid reason to denounce the travel ban? Attack the travel ban for what it is. You don't need to play the ISIS card. If all it takes for a Muslim to go from normal to a head chopping suicide bombing maniac is a temp ban on travel to the US then they were already insane to begin with If we panic about everything terrorists or potential terrorists don't like being a propaganda opportunity, that is just submitting to a different kind of terrorism. ""Islam is peaceful and poses no threat, but this executive order might make moderate muslims mad and make them turn into terrorists""  lol dat doublethink Anyone who thinks ISIS operates in merely a reactionary manner, simply doesn't understand what radical Islam really is.   There is no ban in the UK. So why are so many fighters for ISIS from there? There are people in the London streets yelling about Islam and threatening  your own citizens. How is that working out? Well no shit, a terrorists main objective is to terrify and cause global destabilization and look. Our relations with many different countries are going down the tubes and were pushing everyone out because were afraid when facts state no one from those seven countries have ever commited a terrorist act on American soil. Meanwhile we rip at eachother from inside the country causing unrest within our own borders. If i was an enemy i would point and laugh at us to. right.....so lets do everything we can to appease ISIS so they dont use it as propaganda. In other news: our Harvard experts have confirmed that bombing countries to hell does not create a ""propaganda opportunity"" for Islamic State.  Continued bombing strongly recommended.   So we have to let everyone in because we will upset the terrorists who are sending terrorists into our country to do terrorist things? It makes sense when you think about it. Or does it.   Fuck it. Whatever.... Look at that, now we have to be careful not to offend that terrorist.  No foreign national in a foreign land, without ties to the United States, has any unfettered right to demand entry into the United States or to demand immigration benefits in the United States.  If not letting somebody into my country makes them want to kill me, I do not want them in my country. This should not be controversial - ""let me in or I'll kill you"" is not a reasonable request to make. 1. Allow muslims in, Isis wants to blow you up.  2. Deny muslims entry, Isis still wants to blow you up.   Option 3? Blow up Isis.  Our entire existance is propaganda for isis they hate the west they hate our values they hate everything we stand for I guess we should just kill ourselves thanks reddit MSM and the left are creating a propaganda opportunity by continuously portraying the executive order as some kind of umbrella ban on Muslims.  ""Let's not make the Muslims mad or they will kill us"" ""Let us in, or else!"", basically Are you people really this ignorant? They hate us, they want to kill us, banning them from coming here cannot make them hate us anymore. They already want to kill us.  This is the most idiotic crap I have ever seen. Can't criticize the Koran, can't prevent people that might be dangerous from coming, can't burn the Koran, can't do satire, can't build churches, can't do this or that, or it might create terrorists.    It's almost like a lot of Muslims really aren't compatible with the West. Yes, because it ""may"" be used as propaganda, let's just stop completely and hope they don't continue doing exactly the same thing... UK Government:  Muslims are so violent and dangerous that just rejecting their visa could cause them to murder you.  Right...because it's important the United States mold its policies to what terrorists think and want. Sounds like good reason to ban then  ""Let me come in, or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down"" said the Big Bad Wolf Oh well I guess that it's if they can use it for propaganda the US has crossed a line now. Oh wait they don't need any.  They attacked Belgium and Belgium just let everyone is and was sweet to them.  Muslims are not terrorists!!!! But if you anger them they become terrorists!!!!!!!  Sounds like this guy believes moderate Muslims are so volatile that they're willing to join terrorist groups at the drop of a hat just because they're barred from entering a single country in the world, kind of proves Trumps point, right? Thus proving the need for such a ban.  If a night club kicks me out, I don't then return with a petrol bomb. So then he's implying that Muslims are so unstable that one hurt feeling will flip a switch and turn them into full jihad ISIS mode? LOL It's totally irrelevant now that Mad Dog Mattis has the military reins.  Who cares what Isis is using for propaganda, the only people buying it is half gone idiots in the first place If you fight your enemy, they win. Trump could order the deaths of every American Muslim by the end of the day, and ISIS would still feel the exact same about America tomorrow as they did this morning.  well they hated us well before this travel ban (9/11, embassy bombings, Paris, Brussels, i think you get the point) so know they will hate us more?  This is the most lame attempt at criticizing the ban.  They have wanted us dead for some time, I dont think banning travel from these countries will make us any less safe, maybe not more as well, but certainly not less So Muslims are prone to being radicalized?  The lack of logic in this statement is astounding.  Because you can't immigrate into the US, well that means I have to join ISIS and kill them.  Yup that makes complete and total sense. Ummm, I would argue that the protesters along with CNN and MSNBC plastering the term ""MUSLIM BAN"" all over the 24 hour news cycle would do more harm than anything this temporary immigration order did.  I was banned from Iran for my nationality, and I'm not a terrorist. Why should people from these countries become terrorists based on this temporary restriction?  This kind of proves the point, though, that if something like this triggers a terrorist attack, then we weren't safe to begin with and this was necessary.  Guys, Obama created these lists of countries. Not to mention that if it was a ""Muslim ban"" then why are 90% of the world Muslims unaffected?  Indonesia Bangladesh India Pakistan and Nigeria all have the most Muslims per country. If trump is really "" A FASCIST WAAAAHHH"" then explain why 92% of the worlds Muslims are completely unaffected?   Quit trying to frame everything in a bad light on trump for once. He's trying to keep people safe, and people wonder how we could have prevented attacks. THIS is how.   Edit: ALSO, Obama dropped over 100,000 bombs on these people for 8 years yet he wins a novel peace prize and everyone forgets about that? That's a bomb every 20 minutes for 8 years.   edit: CTR Shills in full force today.  Obama fucking bombed all but 1 of those countries.. What knucklehead thinks ISIS needs American liberals supposed""propaganda?""  Are people really that daft?  These liberals really have no clue do they? 1 + 1 = 3 to them..  SMH  Put stupid in, get stupid out. I guess we shouldn't make laws. Lest we upset criminals or turn people to a life of crime. Great! They now want to really really kill us instead of just wanting to really kill us. yeah just the DAESCH video productions showcasing the indoctrination on 10-yr olds, culminating in the childs' first,  ""mercy kill"" of an adult infidel. tied to a merry go round.   but yeah this travel ban is way more of a recruiting tool than the ISS propaganda videos.  Jesus christ do you people not get sick of bitching about this? I mean every fucking day a hundred articles with you morons just bitching and bitching and bitching about this. I can't even come to this stupid fucking website anymore. Fuck Trump, fuck the refugees, and fuck you. #Fakenews Obama chose the 7 countries. Where was the outrage in 2011 with the Iraqi ban? Liberal hypocrisy! It's not a Muslim ban. Get it right!!! Isn't anything we do against radical Islam going to be used as a propaganda tool? This argument is stupid. Fun fact. This list of nations was compiled by the Obama administration. And no one complained when Obama banned immigrants from Iraq or drone bombed the shit out of Muslims or started wars in Libya and Syria. I'm sick of selective outrage from virtue signalers   So what did Germany/France do to ISIS to provoke them?  They welcomed them all in with open arms.  Point is, you don't need propaganda to get attacked by these pieces of shit.  You shouldn't have to walk on egg shells when dealing with terrorists. This will be buried, I know. But I just wanna say that I never understood this argument. If perfectly normal happy people are going to be driven to commit terrorist acts because they can't visit a country that they likely would never go to anyway, well, I think something else is at play.  Doesn't take an IQ of 120 to figure that one out. The crazy thing is, the propaganda is perpetuated by SJW's whose only intention is to bad mouth Trump for as long as he is in power because they can't help but feel PERSONALLY defeated. Falsely calling it a universal Muslim ban doesnt help, or refusing to accept the fact that the list was created by Obama's administration, or the fact that the ban is temporary. Nope, Trump is Hitler, and all of THAT preaching is what will drive a new age of violence.  Yeah, let's craft policy based on what ISIS wants us to do.  Better outlaw gay marriage then, they might use that as a tool to recruit.  You mean the violent radical Muslim extremists might not like America anymore? Donald trump holding up an lgbt flag and upholding equality among sexes could become a ""propaganda opportunity"" for so called Islamic state, the UK's home secretary has warned. Why don't you just admit everything triggers the Islamic state so who gives a fuck what they think??? They're losing ground as we speak thanks to Assad and Putin.

Doubtful it will become a propaganda opportunity, these idiots still mad about things done by Roman Empire. Besides even if it did, that just makes it easier to kill them when they are all in one area. That is a very islamophobic thing to say. Anything can and will be used for propaganda opportunities, but no need to hand it to them.  Isn't everything the US does a propaganda opportunity for ISIS?  Do not confuse this for support of this EO. It's incredibly ineffective, shortsighted and makes the US look dumb.  meh, they are doing it all the time anyway Luckily we had Obama to point these banned countries out! Thanks Obama! I thought they were raping and murdering infidels already though? ONLY 8% OF MUSLIMS ARE AFFECTED STOP PUSHING A MISGUIDED NARRATIVE. OBAMA DID THE SAME. EXACT. THING. The new administration has to be sure that we have vetting procedures that sercure Americas safety. Its a 90 day ban in order to sort things out, stop the things that have been happening foregin and domestic. Please google ""obama immigration ban 2011. Banning visas from Iraqis for 6 months. The list was issued by the Obama administration. Why do you all not care for safety?  As any action against them could be, so yeah let's just sit back and let them kick up a stink of extremist terrorism just in case someone gets offended when we do something to try combat it.  I'm not defending Trump's latest actions but you hear this line every time there's talk of trying to deal with ISIS etc. Isis don't care about religion anymore, they would accept anyone who wants to join.  Don't forget the stupid [""cowgirl""](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03505/Hasna_Aitboulahcen_3505419k.jpg) suicide bomber from France.  She used to drank alcohol, drugs, sex, and had never read the Quran... If dying children weren't working as a propaganda tool 'ruining my holiday to america' won't either.  Not unlike obamas ""bombing hospitals"" policy Trump doesn't need a lecture from Rudd or May who was Home Secretary before Rudd, considering Britain's disgusting record of border control which has enabled many terrorists and even hundreds of suspected war criminals to reside in the UK.  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9872647/Hundreds-of-suspected-war-criminals-discovered-in-UK.html I don't get it. If he banned everyone from my country or my religion I might think he was an arsehole and a moron - but I'd never become a suicide bomber in response.   Is this report saying that many Muslims are so fragile that they're on the verge of becoming terrorists and anything could set them off? If that's the case it would seem to support Trump's case theory...  Wow I realized there's actually a subreddit on this website that represents both sides of the argument pretty decently.   I'm so sick of reading comments on anything trump related and seeing ONLY shit against him. r/politics is the r/the_donald of the left. r/worldnews, you've gained a subscriber.  Hey Snowflakes, it's not the ""travel ban"" that incites violence, it's the carpet bombs.  Everything is a propaganda opportunity for them.  I understand this could easily be used as propaganda for them but couldn't almost everything done against them in some way be spun to be propaganda? I smell holy war. ""Could"" isn't news. These guys use a BLT as reason to create violent propaganda. Whatever... ""don't hurt the feelings of ISIS or there might be consequences!""  grow a pair you spineless cowards; will you take a stand against *anything?* Literally anything can be used as propaganda against the West. A travel ban is weak even for ISIS. McCain said same thing. I can't understand this logic.  McCain: Trump's ban may fuel ISIS propaganda - 01/29/17   http://thehill.com/policy/international/316748-mccain-trumps-ban-may-fuel-isis-propaganda For the love of Allah can we stop calling it the Muslim ban?  The 'travel ban' IS NOT a ban on Muslim immigrants.  Dubbing it the ""Muslim ban"" is divisive and irresponsible. Of the ten countries on earth that have the largest Muslim populations, only Iran (7th) is on the list.  When people from nine of the top ten countries with the largest Muslim populations are still allowed to travel here it can hardly be considered a ban on Muslims.   Yeah, I'm sure the bombings and weapons sales isn't what's gonna push them over the edge. 'In other news, the sky during daylight hours continues to be blue. Tune in after the break where our seafront correspondent is looking to find conclusive answers to the question, is water wet?' Wouldn't LGBT issues,  belonging to different religions,  and women walking on the street unchaperoned also serve ISIS propaganda.?  ""If you kill your enemy they win"". I'm sure ISIS will understand the nuance that it's not a ""Muslim ban"".   /s I'm sure the fact that the the West is quite prosperous is a propaganda and recruiting tool for ISIS also, should we abandoned the struggle for prosperity?? What about the relative tolerance shown to the LGBT community? I'm sure that's also used for fueling fundamentalist propaganda. Etc. This is outrage over common sense. You mean how it was a propaganda opportunity for CNN and the rest of the fake news outlets? Oh man, probably a good thing we aren't going to let them into the country, then.  This is like saying Islamic countries are to blame for radicalizing that Quebec guy who shot up the mosque the other day.  Is it propaganda if it's true?   Obviously ISIS is going try and paint the whole ""west"" in a broad stroke and Lord knows trump doesn't represent all of us but it's rather clear that a significant portions of Americans see all Muslims as he enemy. Trump would never have gotten far without that. Right, this will make ISIS want to kill us all More ISIS propaganda -> More violence -> More young people turn away from religion.  Its a win.  Dont be scared of terrorists. Dont let them determine, limit or affect what you do. Do what you have to do.  That being said, what this ""president"" did could have been done in a better way. Because bombing the Middle East for 26 years wasn't enough to radicalize them...  I disagree with Trump's policy, but I also don't give a shit what IS thinks. Not long ago people were saying ""why would we want to let people in who will join ISIS or commit terrorist attacks if faced against adversities"" now it's a complete 180 and everyone wants to let everyone in.  Well if you can apply the same logic, a person or a group of people receiving immense amount of hate/threats/discrimination/racism will turn to extreme violent matters, then the same could be said for Trump, all this hate and backlash he receives for every move he makes, it wouldn't surprise me if he gets 100x worse.  ""You won't let us in... GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO FUCKING KILL YOU"" Moderate! I don't want people who are able to be convinced to kill in the name of religion to come here.  The one good thing i'm hoping will come out of this administration is that i'm pretty sure ISIS is fucked.    That Sec of Defense Mattis is gonna fuck them up.   I'm not a Trump supporter and i don't like him.   but this might be the one plus. Why does isis need to say anything, CNN is doing all the work for them. ""see that country you're helping because they promised you you could live there after, they lied, how about you come get revenge"" not exactly the hardest argument to make. Trump clearly hasn't thought many of his/Bannon's policies through ""I cant travel to the us, therefore i will join the group of genocidal maniacs that has been ravaging half of my country""  if you're on this page it sounds to me that you're just looking for an excuse If someone joins ISIS over their anger at a 90 day travel ban, then I'm sure America wouldn't want that kind of person to begin with. Generation of feelings.  Still going strong. Western Civilization as a whole is a propaganda opportunity for IS; where was the outrage when we bombed the shit out of them for years? That's a pretty early ""It's not their fault!"" That however should never bind a government. Hell, anything could be used as propaganda for the IS. Canceling turkeys visa-freedom wish can be used as proof of hate a wall of the unbelieving against the islam.   .  Let me fakenews this: UK home secretary suggests to accept IS influcence in US politics. ""Five more years in Afghanistan, and we get a gold watch!""    -- Jimmy Dore It's funny that you think we're suddenly going to stop doing that now...  [Oh look. Trump's first military raid killed 10 innocent women and children.](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/president-trump-ordered-raid-kills-8-year-old-american-girl-article-1.2960256)  **Edit** It looks like the 8-year old girl killed was the daughter of an al Qaeda martyr. ""We'll kill their families,"" Trump said. He wasn't lying.  That doesn't mean it can't be propaganda  You don't understand how long folks were planning their US visits. This ban is a serious bummer and you shouldn't underestimate the rage they will feel at not seeing Mickey and Goofy. While I get your meaning, and there is certainly a valid argument about American foreign policy in the Muslim world, but you're certainly oversimplifying the issue. This order is extremely high profile, has extremely negative press, and affects a huge portion of people that seek to visit, work in, and call the US home. With stories pouring in about families being separated, especially those who already have valid Visas and Green Cards, this is a PR nightmare and taints the narrative in new ways. US military strikes against suspected terror targets, while at times questionable, can at least be framed in a directed national security context and is part of an ongoing narrative that is pretty established. Hence, its effects are already seen.   This travel ban is creating new ill will, and most informed people seem to agree that its justifications are slim at best and pure political expedience at worst. So while, again, I get your argument you aren't helping by essentially dismissing and minimizing the negative impact of this order. Aha, that may be so. But it's not like most Islamic terrorists give a shit about other Muslims being bombed. They regard Shia muslims as low as ""heretics"" and even other fellow Sunnis as ""corrupted"" somehow. And pooring gas on the flame. Honestly, I disagree. Yes, constant war against various groups killing civilians in the process is a really strong factor, (not just bashing the US, ISIS existing has it's root in the decisions made by Britain, France and Russia during WW1).  But this, this is different. This isn't, oh sorry, we fuck you up while fighting the bad guy. This is, hey you, yes you, fuck you.  It's a direct attack and insult, not on ""the bad guy"", but on every single person in every single one of those countries.  So, while it won't like have nearly as serious as an effect as the wars or the drones, as an insult, it perfectly creates the us vs them mentality that ISIS itself tries desperately to promote.  America has done ISIS' job for them, better than they ever could. And if we don't, people will complain the US lets genocide happen. More fun fact? None of the countries on the list has committed an act of terror on US territory (at least since 1975). Also, Iran is one of the largest and most important forces fighting ISIS. It is a travesty that they are included on the list and Saudi Arabia isn't.  Most of the factions fighting ISIS are absurdly weak, and Iran's assistance is simply indispensible. I'd recommend checking out the Vice documentary on ISIS; it's pretty damn cool.  This logic isn't exactly flawless. I'm no supporter of Trump, but it doesn't take a genius to see that the 9/11 reference is simply stating it as an example of why action is needed against countries that host terrorist threats that exist TODAY, not an argument against the countries in that case specifically.  Apparently the countries are only countries named by Obama as problematic Except 9/11 was mentioned as an example of individuals utilizing visas to enter and attack the United States. Secondly those seven countries: Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen were not random nor were they chosen with a racist agenda. They were identified under the Obama administration as part of the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 (initially only Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Sudan were included, the rest came a short time later.) Under that act, anyone who even traveled to those countries were not, and still are not able to enter the United States under the Visa Waiver program, regardless of their citizenship. National security is not a partisan issue, and individuals who have a nexus to known terror exporting countries should be scrutinized before they are allowed enter the United States. The list of countries was decided on by the Obama administration and adopted for Trump's ban. Saudi Arabia should indeed be included.  agree or disagree with the ban is one issue -- but you guys need to understand that the islamic state and such groups will ALWAYS have issues to use as propaganda -- i hate to break it to you but they also use homosexuality, sexuality in general, as well as  womens rights in the west as propaganda to show how sinful we are--So, should we ban gay marriage so they dont have propaganda? lol of course not..... so from trumps point of view, these guys exist already- they are hell bent on destroying the west -- thus, you should at least have extreme vetting for refugees/immigrants from certain countries -- personally, i think other countries should also be on thr list, but thats a seperate issue as well...  > You can't bomb them out of existence, because every piece of ""collateral damage"" is reason for someone new to say fuck the west.   This. This is my biggest argument for staying the fuck out of other peoples' business. Collateral damage and dictating our policies to puppet governments is what causes people to hate us. I don't care if literally Hitler is in the other room; I'm probably going to take offense to you deciding to blow my house up and killing my family. Sure, I'd probably understand it's better for humanity and try to get past it, but I can't say I honestly know if I would.   The issue here is that the collateral damage sufferers might not think the person we wiped out was literally Hitler; it might have just been Steve, their friend. Right or wrong, they might have not seen them as evil and, well, since a bunch of people they haven't (or likely will never have) met decided to come in and destroy their life before just moving on like nothing happened.   Lots of Americans have hatred toward people they've never met. Those peoples' militaries don't come bombing their shit and expect it to just be accepted.  If you think offending otherwise completely normal and peace-loving Muslims will make them strap a bomb to their chest, you are islamophobic.  ""You kill one terrorist, you make ten."" US forces shooting a child in the neck and letting her bleed out for 2 hours and having Trump and Co call it a grand success and indicative of things to come is going to create far more terrorists than they killed.  you're right but also war is big money, so.  war. I always find word clouds really pleasing to look at. 10/10 novelty account. To me it reads ""Trump will ban people."" Strangely beautiful, especially considering I just got about 45 messages worth of ""but Obama"". It's stupid logic. Propaganda spins a story a certain way no matter what. Maybe Manchester United should be shamed into not winning so many matches in England because that creates a propaganda opportunity for Chelsea to activate its fan base, and we all know that a radical splinter of those beat up people and set stuff on fire.  Which is obviously Manchester's fault then. Be afraid of unreasonable Manchester winning matches. Very afraid. In this case people that are being criticized (muslims with visas/green cards) and the people that get embolded (ISIS fighters) are totally different people.  But USA is known for attacking the wrong target, so there's no surprise there. I imagine it's one piece of a larger radicalisation pie. Killing children is actually the main reason. But this also tells them that the west does hate them Just like violence spreads violence, hate spreads hate. And to people that have nothing to lose and nothing to gain, their mind is but a blank canvas ready to be painted by someone else.  If people straight get their news from this site, and particularly this sub the hysteria makes sense. Some of these comments are positively unhinged.  >This isnt a Muslim ban. Malaysia, Indonesia, Egypt, Bangladesh, Turkey, Pakistan, (and we could keep going) arent banned. Its a ban from seven countries that are considered potential security threats.   I am astounded that propagandists have successfully obscured this obvious fact. I probably shouldn't be, but it seems so plain that Muslims come from other countries than those seven that I don't see how anyone could claim otherwise. The UK home secretary is using this as a propaganda opportunity for himself. If we let them into the U.S. they magically become good, *American* Muslims.  Seeing the Statue of Liberty as you chug past Ellis Island on the ferry boat immediately removes any anti-American sentiment, and they set about chasing the American dream with hard work, optimism, and the desire to be inclusive and productive citizens of the country that gave all that to them.  Or they could disappear into a Muslim enclave in Wisconsin and grow to loathe the infidels they're surrounded by. ""What about proof that everything we say is truth; the west hates you, sees you all as dangerous and even admits themselves that the west isn't meant for you and Islam""  Because it is that argument they are making, nothing about vacations. Lol EXACTLY anyone saying THIS is the straw that broke the camels back is either completely ignorant of what we have done in the middle east or lying  Totes, just let it happen. A look through the comments is often refreshing, what makes the top and what should make the top is never the same with this place.  Exactly!! The hypocrisy and contradiction is astounding.  I am seeing so much of this in the wake of the EO.  I am not interested in appeasing a group that exists with the sole goal to kill me, innocent civilians, and all non muslims.  And if I take a step to try to protect myself from such people and it so pisses you off that you join them, well fuck you too. Glad I know who you are now.  Let them recruit and wipe them all out.  Let Muslims in or they'll become terrorists??? Well the gay people I know aren't running around trying to recruit ignorant heterosexuals.  /s  (in all seriousness, I do agree, the ban should be discussed based on the law/constitution, not propaganda/sensationalism.) Because the ""point"" of the ban is to increase national security. If the act of banning countries bolsters ISIS's recruitment, then it has done the opposite of what it was supposed to. The US didn't make Gay Marriage legal because we wanted better security, therefor Gay Marriage being used as propaganda isn't a headline because it was never meant to be involved in our security status. The U.S. under Obama has been bombing Yemen for years while nobody in America seems to give a damn. I bet more than 90% of Americans couldn't even find Yemen on a fucking map, yet it's a fucking travel ban that would turn moderate muslims into extremists?  > Attack the travel ban for what it is.  ""An attempt to weaken ISIS and other anti-USA terrorist organizations"" *is* what the travel ban is.  If experts are pointing out that it is most likely to cause the opposite of its nominal goal, that's a problem. [removed] Exactly.   This entire story is media sponsored bullshit intended to advance the anti-Trump narrative.  To draw a connection between the two is ludicrous.   Just like this other article that hate crimes against Chinese were up in LA by 6x in 2015 and is Trumps fault because he said in the campaign trail that we are getting beat by China in everything.   You literally cannot make this stuff up.   And yet our liberal citizens,  the most highly educated people in the country, have somehow allowed their emotions to get the best of them and they've forgotten how to think with logic, reason, and demonstrate the most basic understanding of cause,  effect,  and correlation.   It's sad really.    The Left has been biting their tongue for 8 years while Obama is in office. Now that a Democrat is no longer President you will be hearing about ""propaganda opportunity"" on a weekly if not daily basis.   In the same way that 9/11 turned America from ""peaceful"" to ""bombing the shit out of the Middle East"", yes.  Yes, it is possible and logical to be considered peaceful, even if you will retaliate when severely provoked.  EDIT: *I understand that the US was not truly peaceful before 9/11.* I am pointing out the double standard in the implicit assumption that Islam is somehow *unique and uniquely dangerous* because they reacted in a roughly similar way as the US did when backed into a corner. ""Americans are peaceful and pose no threat, but this one terror attack might make moderate americans mad and make them turn into soldiers""   You get that from saying there is an information battle and we have to win people over? We shouldn't giftwrap propaganda to our enemies.  No sensible person would doubt that Islamic extremism is a danger.  The question is what to do to lessen that danger.  Do you honestly believe that, in the long run, this executive order lessens the threat?  I have a feeling you've never had a family member killed by an invading army, or had your house bombed out. Just a wild guess. It kind of makes sense. A moderate is more likely to be swayed to extremism than the other way around. People who walk the fence can tip one way or the other while people who stay far in their corner rarely come out to see what's happening on the other side. How many moderates voted for Trump? We are basically going to tear our own country apart at this rate and no one will be there to save us. Isis will take any action or inaction and turn it into propaganda. That's what they do, they put some BS spin on it and suddenly the west is at fault. That is really their deal. Everything is a reason to hate the western world.    You know ISIS would've hated the U.S even if there was no ban. Only difference is that they're using this as a recruiting tool right now. ISIS cares very little about fellow Muslims.   I'm already imposing Shariah law in my office. That'll keep them quiet. There's a difference between ""doing things to appease them"" and ""not being a dick to the rest of the world."" No one is saying it's a right.  That's not the narrative.  The narrative is that it doesn't do any good to ban people from Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S., especially when those people haven't proven to be a threat to Americans in recent time.   Option 4. Show Isis that the World hates Trump's 90 day ban. Isis still wants to blow you up... Way to completely miss the fucking point. Yeah but they would have more recruits by the evening. ISIS wouldn't change their minds, but other Muslims would. Never worry about the people who have already made up their mind. Worry about those whose minds can be changed. Yes there are idiots in ISIS who love war. But ISIS is always trying to recruit more people. It's going to be easier to recruit people if more people hate America, and if more people don't have anywhere else to go.  Many Syrians are faced with the idea of ""flee, or get caught up in the war."" if you take out the option to flee, suddenly they're going to get caught up in the war, and not everyone will be on the good side. Humans are  Remember that recent attack at a mosque in Canada by that radical Trump supporter. Yeah its not just people who follow a certain religion.  when you spend decades bombing, invading, occupying and committing war crimes against them, yeah.  Imagine if Iraq had invaded the US over some lies. Would you be surprised if Americans started having negative views of Iraq?  because the left would rather double down on calling racism and pray trump does something actually racist, than ever look at any facts from a neutral and unbiased position  they have no choice but to keep maintaining the illusion that the person they have spent so much energy hating is actually bad. if they at any point admit or are proven wrong it will make them look like colossal idiots who have wasted almost a year now constantly screaming into their own echo chamber about how evil he is, when in reality it could just turn out he wanted to make america a bit safer and more economically strong  it's like maintaining an impossible bluff in poker and just hoping, for some reason, everyone else eventually folds Why are you losers hiding behind Obama. Calling a country unstable, which is what he did, is not the same as banning people from coming here. Including those with permanent legal status. Are you people retarded? I thought Obama sucked? I seriously think all you people have a learning disability and tiny dicks.  So why not ban Pakistan and Saudi Arabia? I feel the same exact way Well considering the establishment is using the travel ban as propaganda against Trump, and since the U.S. has also been supplying arms to 'moderate' terrorists, then I guess the title really does hold merit I dont know if this is extemely cynical or actually pretty close to the truth. The Pentagon is claiming that at least some of the women were fighters:  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-38808631  >  ""Take reports of female casualties with a grain of salt. Not all female casualties are civilian casualties. In many cases, and certainly in this one, females can be legitimate combatants.""  The child killed was an 8 year girl whose brother was previous killed in an Obama drone strike.  >  Asked about the boy's death at the time, Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary under Barack Obama, said: ""Maybe he should've had a more responsible father."" business as usual for every president.  I don't see where in his comment you're reading that Trump is not going to continue the bombings. He used the time period of 15 years, so he's clearly not implicating a single president. He said ""anything else Trump does"" which to me directly implies that Trump in fact will continue the bombings. > It's funny that you think we're suddenly going to stop doing that now...  When the hell did he say he thinks that? Why do you lot always need to lie & malign the people you disagree with? oh ok so they've been bombed and their going to continue to be bombed but not letting them into the country is going to be last straw? be serious.  That operation was most likely planned before Trump even took office, all he did was say Go. I don't mean to. But you are forgetting that the narrative we get is not what the people in these countries see. Its hard to care about the US' national security when they're the ones bombing your neighborhood and killing innocent families. The people in these countries don't see the US as liberators or anything like that. Any narrative that our country crafts is only good to the Western countries. ""Terrorism is the price of empire."" -Pat Buchanan Terrorists don't come from being told you can't go to another country. They come from occupation,  foreign aggression, internal conflict enflamed by the west, etc. There are lots of books about ""Blowback"" and very rarely is it ever about some other country you dont really want to go to saying you can't come in. Weren't those countries chosen by obama as ""Credible terrorist hotspots""  Im not trying to start a flame war, I'm just an Aussie trying to get info from the horse's mouth (i.e Americans) 4 of those countries (Libya, Syria, Yemen, and Sudan) are currently in the midst of Civil Wars, 2 of them (Somalia and Iraq) are the midst of sliding into Civil War, and the last country (Iran) hasn't recognized our country in 37 years.  Dear reader: you may have heard this talking point during this past week. Did you ever wonder why it specifies ""*on US territory*""? It's because Iran [bombed a barracks full of US Marines in Lebanon, killing 241](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Beirut_barracks_bombings). Iranian IEDs were also linked to the deaths of [at least 500 American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan](http://www.militarytimes.com/story/military/capitol-hill/2015/07/14/iran-linked-to-deaths-of-500-us-troops-in-iraq-afghanistan/30131097/).  This talking point also relies on the technicality that [the 2011 terror plot by Iranian agents to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States with a bomb and bomb the Saudi and Israeli embassies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Iran_assassination_plot) was foiled before it could be hatched.  In 2006 a naturalized Iranian, Mohammed Reza Taheri-azar, [rammed a crowd of people with a SUV at UNC-Chapel Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_UNC_SUV_attack), injuring 9. He stated that ""I was aiming to follow in the footsteps of one of my role models, Mohamed Atta, one of the 9/11 hijackers"" and that he wanted ""to punish the government of the United States and ""avenge the deaths or murders of Muslims around the world.""  In 2013 Chiheb Esseghaier and Raed Jaser were arrested for attempting to carry out [an attack on a Via Railway train travelling from Canada to the U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_VIA_Rail_Canada_terrorism_plot) RCMP Assistant Commissioner James Malizia told reporters The individuals were receiving support from al-Qaeda elements located in Iran. Canadian and American intelligence experts have linked the plot to involvement by Al-Qaeda elements in Iran. Chiheb Esseghaier is known to have travelled to Iran.  That's a lot of technicalities, isn't it? Linked to 700+ Americans deaths overseas, but not on US territory. Why? Because two attacks were foiled before they could be carried out and another only succeeded in injuring nine people. [removed] Didn't Obama admin have those countries as threats? > More fun fact? None of the countries on the list has committed an act of terror on US territory (at least since 1975).   ...  Oh is that so?  I guess the Somali refugee Abdul Razak Ali Artan that was behind the [recent Ohio State University terrorist attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Ohio_State_University_attack) wasn't actually a Somali refugee.    You got me there.   I guess the media lied, and this must be an example of #FakeNews  It doesn't make sense because Trump is just trying to appease voters. That's all. To be fair, there are Iranian terrorist groups but none have ever posed a threat to the West and the majority of Iranian Americans aren't even Muslim. All the major players spreading this toxic ideology got off scot free.  Hey, my buddy won a grammy for sound editing that documentary. I think the more relevant fact is that this ban wouldn't have stopped any of the recent terror attacks (mostly done by people born in the US).   What's different about Saudi Arabia today and 15 years ago? UAE and Egypt? All of Reddit: doesn't matter; Obama Because executive orders need to be self-evidently constitutional or modify existing law where the POTUS has authority.  He's using the Obama list because he has too. I mostly agree, but I do feel like there's a middle ground between this and staying out completely. I understand the reason for bombings in other countries (even if I don't entirely agree that it's right) but I feel that if it really is necessary, we should also be doing much more to get the support of the people around. They need to be convinced that the guy next door is literally Hitler. And perhaps more importantly, they need to know that we give a fuck about them and that we're not just mindlessly bombing everything because their life is worthless.  This is what really gets me about this ban. It's one thing to bomb somebody's home and say ""Sorry, we were trying to get the bad guy"". But to then shut the door on them when they come for help just seems like rubbing salt in the wounds. Obviously nobody is going to become radicalised overnight because they couldn't visit America one time. But this is an extra fuck you to people who are trying to escape areas that are dangerous largely because of intervention from the west (and Russia). Yeah I don't see where islamaphobia comes in.  If you're alienated and ostracized by developed countries, where do you go? Maybe the group of terrorists who tell you that you're equal in their eyes if you fight with them? It doesn't have to be ISIS. Just look at Iran and their furor against the American government. That was caused by us installing a false leader for them, and the people falling under the spell of Islamic propaganda. Put people in a bad place,  they're gonna react in a manner you won't like.    Stop thinking black and white. There's a whole spectrum of people in the Islamic faith. ISIS isn't recruiting secular, peace loving Muslims. They're recruiting those that are easy to recruit, and just need a tipping point before they actually can become radicalized.  If you put me in cuffs, discriminate against my people, and continue to bomb my country in the mean time, I'd terrorize you too. If the government of the US bombed by house and killed my family for no reason, then banned me from being a refugee, I would become a radical, and I am not Muslim. Would I blow myself up or kill innocents? No, I hope not, but people have different temperaments. However, if I was a Muslim, I'd probably be a Muslim radical as my religion would give me conviction - my mind would be extremely susceptible to religious leaders. This is a subtlety that right wingers like to think is to do with Muslims being violent and other people find it to be common sense. Put Christians in the exact same situation and they will react the same - it's religion that is dangerous, not just Islam, and you require a bit of subtlety and tact to understand different peoples' situations. In the end, the people that go violent due to Islam are the same proportion of people that would go violent from any religion given the same circumstances, and I suspect a lot of them would go violent anyway - a tiny proportion. [Mainstream beliefs in the Muslim areas of the global south are extremist beliefs by Western standards.](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/) It's true that these people are fleeing extremists from their own perspective, but from our perspective they are also extremists. If you lose multiple family members wouldn't you fight against whoever killed them? I'm pretty sure I would. Why dont you invite them to your home? Action! Lets do it! Hosting muslim to show how wrong he is! Incredible how few people are going to go from the US to Iran and purposefully kill civilians because of this  Bro Trump used the phrase Muslim ban first. I don't understand why that fact is being obscured as well... I think the difficulty is that if you run for President calling for a Muslim ban, and then ask Rudy Giuliani how to do it legally, and then implement something that focuses on seven Muslim countries, and then go on a Christian news show to say that you will prioritise Christians over Muslims, and then tweet about how hard Christians in the ME have it, people might find it hard to give you the benefit of the doubt. It's absolutely amazing how effective the reframing has been.   It is widely reported as a ""Muslim ban"" or a ""Muslim travel ban"". It is transparently neither of those things.   The result of this irresponsible reporting is massive protests wherein protesters can identify no complaint or message more specific than ""racism is wrong"" or ""my grandparents were immigrants"". Those platitudes have no relation whatsoever to the EO.  The public dialogue about the EO has been successfully shifted from the merits of a temporary restriction on immigration from a handful of countries long ago identified as problematic to some formless screeching feud about race and ""American values"".  The real menace of this rhetoric is that now, in order to ""defend"" the EO, you have to appear to be arguing with platitudes like ""racism is wrong"". They successfully silence the other side by land-mining the conversation with these contrived associations with racism.  It's really awful to watch the conversations unfold. And the worst part is: *I don't even want to defend Trump*. I want to criticize him. But I can't just give way to the outright dishonest rhetoric being used to reframe every political conversation about the guy.  It's all a mess. TBF not having any considerations for green cards and visa's was an unnecessary oversight and greatly contributed to the clusterfuck. Do you know how I know you didn't read the article It's a lot easier to knock over that strawman, and ignore how ones actions can impact others on a deeper level. I also love how people keep comparing the entirety of Obama's presidency to the first week and a half of Trump's. >""What about proof that everything we say is truth; the west hates you, sees you all as dangerous and even admits themselves that the west isn't meant for you and Islam""  >Because it is that argument they are making, nothing about vacations.   ""The west hates you not because they bomb us and help our enemies but because they temporarily banned some of us from certain countries to travel there""  If that is the argument they are making then it won't be that effective. If you are working as a translator for the US with the hope that you will one day get to go to the US, and you see the events of last weekend, are you going to risk your life for the US still?  The world isn't binary. There isn't some huge tipping point of behavior. This is about small nudges that can have large effects on a societal scale.  Did any one individual who bullied the Columbine shooters cause that shooting? No. That would be an inane argument. Did the weight of all of that not in some way affect those killers? No. [removed] Good point honestly We better just let them take over then. Anything we do in the name of national security is liable to make ISIS mad and therefore decrease national security. Checkmate USA. Many many people on the left criticise the foreign policy mess that has been churning around for decades. Some leftists are, as you imply, selective in when or what they choose to criticise, I guess as part of a strategy to ensure the 2nd worst policy gets enacted instead of the absolute worst?  I'm with you though, US foreign policy was shit long before Trump or Bush etc. BUT this doesn't mean Trump shouldn't face criticism for continuing it/making it even worse.   It's not to weaken isis necessarily,  it's to strengthen American homeland security  Wait so if we piss off ISIS, they might become terrorists?   I realize I'm twisting your words but in all seriousness, it really doesn't mean anything to piss off a group that you already can't reason away from committing genocide.      Before the pitchforks come out, I'm not in support of the ban just on the side of making sure we don't extrapolate, project, tout and assume things that will turn into news that starts a world War. That's all.   The question is - does it actually do that in any meaningful way, while avoiding large-scale detrimental effects.  If no Muslim was ever allowed in America, would there be fewer Americans killed in Islamic terror attacks? (Fewer than the 5 per year average over the last decade) Likely yes. Would America miss thousands of doctors, lawyers, engineers, and all around good, hard-working people? Would our society be measurably worse if we took away the 3.3 million Muslims in our country? Yes.  I find it fascinating the lack of nuance in these discussions. The easiest answer is to treat this as a black and white issue and do the simple thing.   Some Muslim immigrant commits a crime? Forbid Muslim immigration. A Muslim citizen commits an act of terror? Put full-time police officers in mosques and tap every Muslim's phone. Happens again? Ban Islam.  But in each of these things, we have to consider that we are giving something up, if not only economically, culturally, etc. then also in terms of our values, standing in the world, and even adherence to the Constitution.  There are no easy answers, but I would challenge you to identify what line of intervention with respect to preventing terror stacks you *would not* cross. Those are different.  You shouldn't upset your enemies if avoidable. Not even enemies, but anyone that might harm you. Don't provoke people. Avoid conflict.  However, calling the cops on your husband is avoiding conflict. Where do you get the idea that the country's liberal citizens are its most highly educated? [We were bombing the shit out of the Middle East way before 9/11, just so you know.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War) 9/11 and a 90 day refuge ban are not the same thing.  Sure, bombing their countries could be a reason but that's not the topic at hand.    A refuge ban is never a reason to turn into a terrorist and assuming that they will shows how little you truly think of them. Violent terrorist attack against a nation = temporarily revoking privileges to some foreigners.  Okay. It's the US.  We gotta bomb something.  Right, because saying ""no we don't want you to come over and play"" should elicit the same reaction as ""I'm going to go murder some of them"". Conflating 9/11 to a six month immigration ban on countries that harbor terrorists - only on Reddit  This so much. I use the same reasoning with North Korea. NK will say anything to sound like a threat, but they are poor cowards in a dying state. No matter what we say or do, they will continue to make empty threats against the West. that applies to politics in general.  one side does or says something.  the other side finds some way to condemn it, even if they generally agree. if trump made a fucking Ham sandwich they would use it as a recruiting tool  ""Hey Obama, stop killing innocent people in the middle east for 8 years!""   If only I could send text messages back in time >Imagine if Iraq had invaded the US over some lies. Would you be surprised if Americans started having negative views of Iraq?  Sure. And I'm sure this action will cause people to have negative views of America. There is a pretty solid leap from having negative views about something to beheading children, murdering civilians, and taking sex slaves, though.  You're exactly correct.  Facts:  -list made by OBAMA  - 92% of Muslims worldwide completely unaffected, yet still called - ""Muslim ban.""  - Halting immigration from countries that export terrorists way more often then others. It's quite simple  The left just wants to throw anything at trump as him being a ""HATEFUL RACIST WAHHH"" and collective Reddit is having a meltdown now.  Trump could cure cancer and it would be racist to those with diabetes.  I have no idea wtf America is doing in Afghanistan anymore. They say we're killing jihadists in training camps, but I'm not sure if we've completed the ""are you a jihadist?"" questionnaire for the subjects prior to droning them.  At this point, I presume we've resorted to bombing any large groups of people, and any place with monkey bars.  Damn. That is some cold shit.  While what the pentagon is claiming may be true, the pentagon has a known track record of being generous when classifying fighters. There are plenty of occasions where civilians where classified as fighters, so their reports aren't always representative of reality. While that may be true regarding female fighters, what is definitely true is that every male above a certain age (like 14 or 16) is considered a militant, by association. Human shields are a reality in the war against the caliphate. BECAUSE NO WOMAN OR CHILD HAS EVER KILLED ANYONE Well that is one thing people don't seem to consider, women are also active participants in terror attacks and militant movements.   Despite having a different standing in Islamic societies than they have in the west, it appears women blowing people up doesn't seem to scandalise them nearly as much as it does to us.   Western mentality still has very much the view that women are innocent angels and mostly always victims, its odd to think about it.  It's right to complain about both policies. I would never claim that most people see the US as liberators, or even support US bombing operations in affected countries. My essential argument here is that the Muslim world is a whole lot bigger than the group that sees the US ""bombing your neighborhood and killing innocent families"". A lot of people prone to radicalization are young people within the US and other developed countries. Something as high profile and directly and visibly damaging to innocent bystanders as this ban is on a new level. Young Muslims, disaffected by not only religious or ideological differences, but also of economic and personal issues similar to gang push factors in many US communities, see their TVs filled with massive protests against the President's plan and see much of the status quo support the program or look the other way. I expect this ban to serve as a much more effective radicalizing factor because it is new, high profile, and affects much more than security policy to most Americans. I see what you mean, but to be fair, I'm not saying it's because they wanted to go to America, so much as because it's insulting.  Like if a business has a ""no blacks"" sign, the insult cuts far deeper than the physical inability to use the service.  But, look, I'm not Islamic, nor have I ever been to the middle east, so everything I am saying is straight out of my arse anyway. I think be banned them on the grounds of their known instability. There are also some key differences (or so I've heard) from Obama's travel ban and this current one. Just shows what a circle jerk Reddit has become where you have to justify yourself for wanting to ask a simple question without being insulted and downvoted to hell.  It's complicated. There is more investigation of refugees from those countries already. But Trump shut it down entirely, including reentry for people with green cards (temporary residence permits previously issued by the US).  More details: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/28/trump-immigration-ban-syria-muslims-reaction-lawsuits >4 of those countries (Libya, Syria, Yemen, and Sudan) are currently in the midst of Civil Wars, 2 of them (Somalia and Iraq) are the midst of sliding into Civil War  This explains the civilians fleeing violence. Isn't Iran mostly Shiite though? As far as I know, most Islamic terrorism comes from Sunnis, right?  Although we still allow people from other countries who are in the midst of civil wars and wars with other countries to travel to the United States. We allow Russians to come and go as they please, despite their conflict with the Ukraine. Also, a civil war is not a war with the US. If the Sudan is not our ally and the Sudanese are attacking one another, which of our allies are being hurt? None. >  (Iran) hasn't recognized our country in 37 years  i though they recognized us as in a ""we hate you, politically speaking"" kind of thing. I'm not too familiar so i could be wrong. can I get more information on this?  hey thanks for this, I knew that I should've researched further but hated Trump for the Muslim ban and this has changed my perspective a little bit..  The 1983 barracks attack and the IEDs were directed at soldiers, so these are not terrorist attacks (I'm not saying they should go unpunished). So you are left with a few failed or non-fatal attacks, while the countries whose citizens committed 9/11 go unbanned. Not much of a talking point.  So looking at an international perspective on Americans, how will this ban help prevent any further deadly attacks on our military abroad?  This EO has been pushed as making Americans feel safer and I'm sure many Americans do feel safer.  This list was made by Obama and that is no surprise.  We know that there are terrorists in these countries.  But if we are banning entry into this country then their issue is terrorism at home.  And the fact of the matter is that there have been no deadly terror attacks perpetrated by nationals of those countries IN THE USA.  If this were an executive order on bombing those countries and there was still outcry, then these are valid and topical points.  But to me it feels like this EO will be a rallying cry for ISIS to say ""See we told you.  America does not care about you.""  This is exactly what we knew would happen, Trump has alluded to this for over a year.  The speculation has to end soon which will be better for discussion and progress, but I fear that this could cause an immense backlash that we did not want to see. Lebanon-based Hezbollah did the Marine Corps barracks bombing. Yes, they were assisted by Iran and Syria, but if you follow your logic, Lebanon should be on the list too.  Maybe this talking point specifies ""on US territory"" because that's the only relevant territory when discussing an order that bans people from traveling to the US. Okay so Somalia makes sense -- what about the other six, and what about preventing another 9/11? One with vague references to his Somali-*American* community, and one with nothing even resembling terrorism? It's not terrorism just because a Muslim attacks someone.  And I believe the context of that visa waiver issue was basically saying ""hey, usually you just fill this online form in and we trust you and let you in when you show up at one of our airports. Now if you've been to one of these risky areas you're required to get an actual visa, which means an interview before getting on the plane in the first place"". Pretty fair, considering. However I think this EO has stretched that logic a bit far without much evidence other than executive emotion...  Trump was perfectly free to ignore Obama's list or change it. And the visa waiver program is the same as refusing green card holders entry? ok.... well Trump is president now so what's to stop trump from adding a few countries to the list?    I really fail to see how because obama had a similar list Trump gets off the hook Someone needs to refresh my memory on what is labelled a terrorist attack and what isn't. Cause I don't know anymore. The majority of Iranian Americans aren't Muslims because they had to flee their violent and oppressive Islamic regime.  My buddy's grandparents were publicly executed in Iran for being Baha'i.   It's not my job to examine the landscapes of countries and assess the level of risk they present, that job belongs to a very educated and very trained group of people employed by the US Government. And those people assessed the countries of risk and found that the 7 listed presented the highest risk, making it necessary to enforce a level of action.  It should also be noted that this group of people did so and made this list of 7 countries under the order or president Obama, not Trump. There is a major difference between Obama's actions and Trump's. Obama Identified countries with unreliable internal vetting processes and required that citizens from those countries were subject to our vetting and granted visas. Trump decided that even those who we have granted visas to should be banned. People seem not to understand the difference between banning someone who has already been granted a visa and requiring them to acquire a visa. and we kill them with drones not bans. I think anyone who is turned into a white supremacist from seeing stuff like that is an idiot and a horrible person. I think the logical reaction to videos like that is - ""god damn it these people are retarded"" and move on with your life.  >I hear a lot of people on reddit arguing that things like MTV's white guy video helps turn people into white nationalists  People who say that were White Nationalists to begin with, and were using that talking point as a tool for possible recruitment.  I don't agree with the ban but I do love that your only alternative to people in Muslim countries moving to America is joining terrorist groups. Why do you rule out the possibility people in Islamic countries might chose to fight for democracy? He's attempting to slander you, a person who holds moderate American views, and by extension people who share those views (and liberals), as islamaphobes, that's why he mentioned it. Not argue honestly. He's not saying all of them are going to become terrorists, he's saying it is going to help them recruit at a better rate now.   You say he's speaking in black and white while you are speaking as if it's all or nothing.     Think of it this way, they are already recruiting at what I'd assume is an unacceptable rate with their propaganda.   Now we just gave them their propaganda wet dream.    Edit - spelling mistake. Iran isn't killing any Americans.... It's not being misframed. You're being gaslighted.   On Trumps website. Still, right now, TODAY.   https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-statement-on-preventing-muslim-immigration  > Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.  It's right on his web page.   Here's Giuliani telling Fox it's a Muslim Ban  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/29/trump-asked-for-a-muslim-ban-giuliani-says-and-ordered-a-commission-to-do-it-legally/?client=ms-android-google.  > I'll tell you the whole history of it, Giuliani responded eagerly. So when [Trump] first announced it, he said, 'Muslim ban.' He called me up. He said, 'Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.' ""  So what about Obama's list?   The reason Trump is using Obama's list is because ""Obama's list"" was actually created by Congress with him, giving it legal authority.   It was created in response to a prevented terror attack planned by refugees (the only confirmed attempt by refugees in America). The Obama administration took this seriously, and placed temporary restrictions on new Visas from Iraq, and took 6 months to create a new stronger vetting system (""extreme vetting?""). During that time, refugees were still coming from Iraq, just fewer while they created the new system.   Those 7 countries were singled out by the Obama administration, and then approved by Congress so that there was a legal reason and authority to temporarily slow the flow from a specific country if there was a threat of terror until any vetting issues could be resolved.   This list was Obama, with the help of Congress, reacting pragmatically to the threat of a specific terrorist attack, and making it easier to expedite this process in the future to make attacks more preventable.   Trump on the other hand, is using this lis It because it's the only way he has the legal authority to do what he did. That's it. Otherwise, he would have to get Congressional approval.   If he was serious about this, he could absolutely meet with Congress and do this himself. Instead, he's using the Obama list as political coverage, which proves this is just political.   Otherwise, why would he use Obama's list, who Trump has called [the worst President ever?](https://mobile.twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/760552601356267520)  Why would he trust Obama's list from 6 years ago, and not create his own?  Because despite saying for the last year that Obama is a corrupt incompetent Kenyan born Muslim Tyrant, using Obamas list *provides legality to his executive order* because Congress approved it.   So refer back to Giuliani. This is a Muslim Ban. The same Muslim Ban still on his website. It's just a shitty incomplete Muslim Ban, because the only legal way to do it is to use Obama's list, or to get Congress to approve another list.   If Donald Trump gave a shit about our security, he would go to Congress and the JoS, identify the countries that are problems, and the clearly state to the public how we were going to handle this. This list would certainly include Pakistan, a hotbed of terrorist activity, and Saudi Arabia where the 9/11 hijackers came from.   But Trump is actually a fan of Saudi Arabia, despite the fact that Saudi Arabians killed 3000 Americans 15 years ago.  > ""They buy apartments from me,"" Trump said during the Alabama rally. ""They spend $40million, $50million. Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much.  [Source](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/306990-trump-appeared-to-register-eight-companies-in-saudi-arabia)http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/306990-trump-appeared-to-register-eight-companies-in-saudi-arabia  So clearly this has nothing to do with 9/11, or Saudi Arabia would be on the list. But that didn't stop the order from using it as justification anyways, despite not a single 9/11 hijacker being from those 7 banned countries.  > ""The visa-issuance process plays a crucial role in detecting individuals with terrorist ties and stopping them from entering the United States,"" the ordersaid."" Perhaps in no instance was that more apparent than the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, when State Department policy prevented consular officers from properly scrutinizing the visa applications of several of the 19 foreign nationals who went on to murder nearly 3,000 Americans.""  This is Trumps Muslim Ban. Yes it's a shitty, incomplete Muslim Ban, but that's because bans on religion are illegal. This is just the only legal avenue available, unless they get Congress to approve another list.  He said he wants to ban Muslims. It still says it on his website. And he just did it. There's no mystery here, just reframing by the Trump Administration, because otherwise it's illegal.  Exactly. I think the firepower any Muslim propaganda will have will come from the very home grown propaganda seen by just this example as made possible by the media.  Protesters can't come up with any complaint beyond racism? That's incredibly facile.  1. Implement EOs that stay fully within the bounds of the Constitution.  2.  Spend more time consulting with DHS, DOJ, State, etc to identify if the EO is the right approach, is legal, is worded correctly.  3. Consider using Congress ( which the GOP controls!) to make sweeping changes to immigration law.  4. Consider the repercussions for legal permanent residents and those on student visas, etc.   5. If DHS tells you it likely cannot apply to green card holders, take their advice.  6. Focus on implementing it in a clear, consistent fashion so that staff on the ground at airports etc know what the EO means and what they are supposed to do.  7. Avoid inflammatory rhetoric in writing and discussing the EO.  8. Don't have border agents ask green card holders their opinions of Donald Trump.   9. When a federal judge grants a stay, have DHS respond to that federal order, as is required under US law.  10. Consider whether or not there is data behind the EO, and if it will actually make Americans safer, or if it's just an EO pandering to your voter base  11. Consider the effects on America's world standing and relationships with key allies.  12. Consider the effects on our abilities to work with Muslim partners (including from the banned countries) in fighting ISIS.  13. Avoid religious tests or the presumption therein in your EO. Don't go on a Christian network and talk about how you will prioritise Christians over Muslims.  I could go on, but it's late.  Hope that's a little more than ""racism is wrong"", though. >  I don't even want to defend Trump. I want to criticize him. But I can't just give way to the outright dishonest rhetoric being used to reframe every political conversation about the guy.  Well there it is, this is how /r/The_Donald flourished  This happened to me too, I wanted to check if the outrage was real (during the campaigns)  and it turned out to be massive propaganda.  Its still shitty to bar visa holders.  Those are frustrating, because it seems to be the most often repeated arguments for Trump. Compete red herrings. Divert attention and counter attack without ever addressing the topic at hand. You'd need a wall on ideas for that, not on people. I'm not sure how many acts of terrorism have been committed by foreign nationals on US soil since 9/11, but there have been acts committed by US nationals or people who otherwise were already in the United States.   While the executive order may keep people out, it does not keep ideas out. ISIS doesn't need to get people into the Unites States to commit acts of terrorism, recruiting those already within works just as well, if not better. The entire point of 9/11 was for us to ask why attack us? Their hope was that we as citizens would look at what our government was doing in the middle east and demand they stop. I mean it's a fucking retarded plan, but we were bombing them way before they attacked.  And I didn't see anyone in the media up in arms when Obama was bombing **5** of the 7 countries on this ban.  It's immoral to stop them traveling to the United States!  But it's totally cool to bomb the shit out of them! > Sure, bombing their countries could be a reason  lmao. Could be. maybe. just a little bit. Yeah dude the lengths people are going to make this sound like the most horrible thing that's happened in 10 years is completely ridiculous.  >9/11 and a 90 day refuge ban are not the same thing.  You are absolutely right, terrorist attacks are committed by individuals or fringe ideologies so it's my fair to blame everyone with slightly similar beliefs or the same nationality. The policy of a democratic government represents all the people in the country.  >No one can say America is peaceful with a straight face lol.   Am American. You forget who we are. We *can* say America is peaceful with a straight face. It would be a lie but we can do it. We're numb.  You'd think so, but a lot of Americans on here would think otherwise 90 days* Just don't challenge Kim Jong-Un to a round of golf. I hear he can shoot a 17 on an 18 hole golf course.  yeah, there is absolutely no rationality behind their ideology but destroying everything in their path.  I'd be on board with that.  Even go so far back as to Iran Contra affair, and avoid supporting Osama in the first place.  Generally screwing around in the Mideast has come back to bite America's ass in some form or another just about every time. It seems that when you're spending as much money on the military as America is, you've gotta use it, even if it's ill-advised to. America isn't that involved in Afghanistan anymore. At this point, US involvement is limited to part of a NATO force supplementing the Afghani military, specifically there are 9,800 US troops as part of the 13,000-troop NATO coalition backing up the 350,000-strong Afghan military. And the only reason we're still there even at that capacity is because the Taliban currently control roughly one third of the country. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_in_Afghanistan 1st things 1st: I love America.  That being said I can't help but wonder how many extremists are extremists because of an ideology and how many want justice...   Edit: ooooookaaaaaayyy let me make myself a little bit more clear: what I'm getting at is there may be more than one factor at play here. Maybe JUST MAYBE we should be a little more critical of our governments tactics and the amount of collateral damage. And maybe if they were just a bit more careful isis would have less fighters.  That's it.  That's all.  I am not an extremist sympathizer. The US has some cold people.  Bear in mind, cattle ranchers that got rich in the territories killed farmers with hired hands to take land and water.  Our country was founded by slavery, and goddamn if we didn't turn it into a fine way to breed and show off our fellow man's flesh, for gold.    We are a cold people, through and through.  Maybe not all of us, but enough. ""Yes, we have high confidence the dog was a Taliban spy."" This was al-Qaeda in Yemen, not ISIS. Out of curiosity, do you have an statistical data on how much higher of a percentage of the youth is being radicalized in the US? UK? Middle East? This is the most concerning issue that this election has created in my opinion. I understand how people can be sick of being politically correct all the time, but I think it is unfortunate that we refuse to be politically correct about issues that can affect US relations and even US citizens relations with citizens in the arab and/or greater muslim world as a whole. First step to defeating ISIS IMHO would be to ensure the youth in the muslim world don't empathize with the ISIS fighters and it's a scary thought that a bunch of grown men in the US are trolling around the internet spewing hate for muslims. Yes, they were chosen because of their inability to work with the US visa program. All of these countries have unstable if not non-existent governments with lax record-keeping. Pretty difficult to vet anyone from them. You mean it not being a travel ban and being a ban on visa waivers? Obama didn't have a travel ""ban"", he just changed it to require them to get tourist visas (like most countries citizens entering the U.S.). TBH I havent been able to find a place that actually lists the full run down of all the EO Trump is putting down most of the time its hyper sensationalised or one sided.   Is there an official listing of all the orders being carried out and the parameters of each? Mainly that Obama's wasn't a travel ban at all. Mainly that there was no travel ban with Obama. In the case of Obama, people in certain allied countries don't have to get a tour visa or be vetted but anyone coming from, or who has visited the listed countries,  has to apply for a visa and be vetted.  In other words Trump is freezing immigration people from countries where, under Obama there were higher vetting standards. Obama did not implement a travel ban.  The action was related to what visa people from those countries needed.  Separately, acting on specific intelligence, there was a limited block on some people coming from Iraq. It's not unique to Reddit. Serious question; who is going to rebuild Syria and Libya once the majority of people with skills have sought asylum in another country?  Hezbollah is the only notable Shia terrorist org, who was formerly backed by the Iranian government. The last time Hezbollah attacked American assets was during the Lebanese civil war though.  Right? The whole reason people say ""on US territory"" is because the US has a very specific vetting process for the people we allow into this country. Vastly different than European vetting. Thus, the very few amount of terrorist attacks from these countries in the US.  Our vetting processes for people from these countries has resulted 0 acts of terror in the past ~30 years by people from these countries, which would lend to the idea that our vetting process WORKS. Which, in turn, makes people question what the rationale was behind Trump's EO. > (I'm not saying they should go unpunished)  Hmm... How much time must pass though? I mean... that's like nearly 35 years. The people who were into this back then are very old or dead.   Iran especially over the last few years seems to have changed it's tune a fair bit. The issue is that this order doesn't really do anything beneficial. The states selected aren't churning out terrorists by the dozens. This EO was a win win for Trump. He follows through on a campaign promise and even though four judges issued stays and people are protesting, he's dominating the news cycles without actually doing anything with major geopolitical implications. It's no coincidence that this list, even though it was created by the Obama administration, has left off places like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.  I really don't think people can comprehend just how powerful Saudi Arabia is since they can solely manipulate the price of oil, which significantly affects states where the cost to get oil out of the ground is much higher than SA.   This EO was issued because it benefits Trump and that's it. It doesn't keep any of our military members safer abroad, in fact I'd say this dangers them and American citizens in general. The perpetrators of these terrorist attacks that have been committed recently have primarily been by radicalized while they've been in the US. This certainly doesn't make Muslims feel included into society. ISIS then tries to recruit members based on these feelings.  I think you're completely right that ISIS will use this as a tool to recruit more members, but I sincerely hope that they don't. * Multiple law enforcement agencies confirmed it's terrorism.  * [Law enforcement officials stated that Artan was inspired by terrorist propaganda from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and radical Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Ohio_State_University_attack#Terrorism_classification)  * He clearly states the motivation in a [Facebook post](http://ijr.com/2016/11/745287-make-peace-with-daesh/). I'm not even going to quote it here because I'd end up on a list. Open and shut case of political/ideological/religious terrorism.  * ISIL claimed responsibility.  How anyone can credibly assert it isn't terrorism is beyond me. > However I think this EO has stretched that logic a bit far without much evidence other than executive emotion...  It's also laughably contradictory, citing 9/11 as reasoning multiple times but not banning any of the countries whose citizens were responsible for 9/11. =IF(perp=muslim,""terrorist"",if(perp=mexican,""illegal"",""lunatic"")  > those people assessed the countries of risk and found that the 7 listed presented the highest risk  Yes  >making it necessary to enforce a level of action.  No, the intelligence agencies have all said they see no reason for to ban immigrants from those countries.  Obama made a list, he didn't ban those countries.  Trump has to justify why he's banning immigrants from those countries, he can't just take a list obama made and say it's obama's list, because that was NOT a list of countries to ban people from.  Obama and the people from his administration (Like Sally Yates) are against the EO, full stop, so if we're going by what they did, he should repeal the EO immediately.    Bomb them in the name of liberty and then say ""hey, not our problem, seek help elsewhere"" doesn't really suprise me as an imflamatory stance, one which would deeply embitter a previous decent individual.  > Why do you rule out the possibility people in Islamic countries might chose to fight for democracy?  The 800lb. elephant here is that it's fairly well understood even if you magically gave full out democracy to many of these countries, they would vote for politicians who would enact oppressive religious law.   Just look at what measures Lebanon has to take to maintain any semblance of stability, or better yet, take a look at what happened in what many considered the first legitimate election in the history of Egypt: the people elected a president from the Islamist party, resulting in the military staging a coup less than a year later.  Because the way that these Muslims see it they are fighting for their country and their right to self determination. Obama killed somewhere between 1500 - 3000 civilians in drone strikes while in office. These are mothers, brothers, fathers, sons, aunts, and grandparents. It is perfectly reasonable that from the perspective of a person living in one of these countries, America is the terrorist organization and that they are at war with them. Why would someone from Afghanistan fight for democracy when they could instead take vengeance on the government that killed their family? The only way to counteract this is by presenting a positive image of America, and accepting immigrants and refugees from these countries is one way to do that.  As a liberal myself, the guy who called him islamophobic is just an idiot. It's 100% true that people radicalize because their loved ones are killed or the west keeps giving them more and more reasons to say 'Fuck you America'.  That's the point I was trying to make.  Which then provided Donald with a compounding interest rate of political influence, when he pointed out the media was biased against him--and they actually are! ""They're against me because they don't want change."" Rarely covered on TV news, that is for sure, but it was decently covered in print. I know a ton of people, civilians and journalists, who were pissed off st the drone strikes. Maybe you should get out more?  There is no rationality to their ideology.  There is absolutely a rationality to the means they use to try to achieve that ideology.    Let's just agree that Osama Bin Laden has been outrageously successful in achieving his goals. 9/11 and the subsequent war in Iraq has increased hostility between the Islamic and western worlds.  Kind of like a Time share.  Drone doesn't care.  You would be kidding yourself if you denied that we (the USA) didn't start this when we armed Afghanistan to fight the soviets, and overthrew the Shah of Iran Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh who was voted for through diplomatic process... I also love America, but I can't help but think we may be the bad guys here. Bin Laden himself was inspired to carry out 9/11 after watching America attack and bomb the middle east, in cahoots with Israel. These people aren't as crazy as you think. They were provoked.  > how many want justice...  I've been posting this link several times for the past days, but I believe it's *really* worth a read. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/5qpioz/redditor_explains_why_radical_terrorists_have/dd1hfvr/)  Goes in the same direction as u/suzy_sweetheart86 and u/Crazymoose86  comments The US tried to use a cat as a spy once during the cold war  The dog is the only one of the deceased whose identity we even knew. We decided he should die based on his cell phone metadata.  All those unknown deceased in dogs vicinity were def ""enemy combatants"" though. For sure. We don't know who they were, but we know they were the enemy. I'll try to find some in my research, though I don't recall a definite number. I'll try to summarize what I found real quick though. I know that the US has a comparatively lower radicalization rate due to factors such as better integration as a percentage of population and greater geographic isolation from unstable zones. Europe has a more difficult problem because of long term issues with a lack of integration (especially in France) and the geographic and border issues that come with proximity to the Middle East and free travel through the Schengen Zone. In the Middle East the factor are often different and radicalization is more direct. For example, a Syrian living in Aleppo was more likely to become radical as he might have been directly oppressed by the government or seen friends and family killed. In the US and Europe it is more of a call to Muslim purpose and identity preying on the gullibility and vulnerability of young people.  God knows I am no fan of the Iranian regime, but I'm pretty sure their government is stable and competent enough to keep records. That sounds pretty specious to me. *With the exception of Iran.  Them being on that list probably has more to do about the ongoing sanctions against the country. So then why is this travel ban so egregious? If BO initiated the ban during his presidency, and it is still difficult to vet people from those countries, how is a 90 day ban as bad as everyone makes it seem? This right here. That's why a law was passed in 2015 in case problems arose from these countries. ISIS has training and recruiting programs in these countries. Also all of those countries wont let you in if your passport has been stamped by Isreal.  Yeah, that was one. Green card holders weren't affected, I don't believe. Major oversight of Trump's EO ban. Nope. People from all these countries had to go through a vet and personal interview to get a tourist visa even before Obama signed that law. The law required people from 3rd countries, who were eligible for WVP, to get visas if they have been in any of the named countries.  For instance if I, a German, would take a short day trip by ferry to Qeshm during my upcoming vacation in Oman, as per the 2015 law I would have to apply for a visa to the U.S. when coming to Orlando for the next MS Ignite conference. I think the visa would be granted even under the current circumstances; I would not be directly affected by Trump's EO. Before the 2015 law, I would still have been eligible for WVP after travelling to Iran. [This is the ban EO.](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.bbc.co.uk%2F1%2Fshared%2Fbsp%2Fhi%2Fpdfs%2Ftrump_executive_order_refugee_curbs.pdf) https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/27/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states  http://www.npr.org/2017/01/31/512439121/trumps-executive-order-on-immigration-annotated Wait please ELI5 because people around me keep saying ""OBAMA DID THE SAME THING IN 2011"" but I need someone to explain how they are different or similar  It's a silly question to ask, because if they don't leave they'll get injured or killed, and then who is going to rebuild Syria and Libya? Serious reply: take a look at the Congo's history. The answer is warlords. It's just that no one's going to like the society they build.  I'm Syrian and pretty much UAE peeps are buying up heeeaaaaappppsssss of land in Syria so most likely them and Syrians.  This is one of those internal debates I have about refugees. When I see coverage of people trying to live in bomb riddled cities, or refugee camps, I can't fathom that existence and believe they should be helped to get out of the carnage. On the other hand, should we be letting them alone, forcing/aiding them to fight and take back their country?  Their own fucking people?    Crazy.  I know.    Let's not downplay Hezbollah, though. It is essentially fully functional army, complete with mechanized and armored units. It is stronger than the Lebanese Army.      Iran remains the single largest state sponsor of terror. It provides funds and equipments to not only Hezbollah, Hamas, and others, but it also uses a fully legitimate branch of it's military, the IRGC, to commit terrorist attacks abroad. Also, something around 90% of muslims are Sunni.  FBI chief said under oath that our vetting process isn't reliable in Syria and other regions of conflict My point was that soldiers are legitimate targets, though no respectable country is going to ignore attacks on them. The Reagan administration, for example,  responded by, um, withdrawing the U.S. forces and later selling arms to the Iranians and lying about it to Congress. Best. President. Ever. Well I think the issue of Saudi not being on the list is definitely one that should be discussed. But it's a separate issue altogether because it's MUCH BIGGER due to more links that would need to be untangled first. It's so difficult to ever discuss anything when people on reddit feel the need to discuss EVERY ISSUE EVER in EVERY THREAD. Things can be important but not overrule everything else. Nothing gets solved if we try and solve everything in one go with one criteria... ugh this place is exhausting lately  Sorry that turned into a rant  If I were a Muslim living in the Middle East, I certainly wouldn't think the USA was looking out for me.  And they wouldn't necessarily be wrong, which is the part that's truly sad. Makes killing easy. Feel bad from the guys that have to pull the trigger. Eye in the Sky is a really good movie about s drone strike and killing of no combatants.  ...and helped Irak fight Iran for a decade, actually intervention in the Irak-Iran war, accidently shooting down a Iran airlines by the USS Vincennes while being in Iranian water.   And obiously the Iran are also irresponsible if there boats enters international water and come to close to a US warship. Even if it's just a few miles from Iranian waters and the US is pretty much on the other side of the planet.   All reasons to call them part of the axis of evil (whatever that means).  How dare they feel threathend and seek nukes, because some country with thousand of nukes, that actively supported a dictator and then war against them try to tell them what to do? Story goes that Bin laden saw on TV news, a multi story hotel in Beirut Lebanon; being bombed to bits by Israel.   He wanted to inflict similar damage to the West in revenge.  US troops in Mecca didnt help soothe him either. It was actually much simpler, it was about pride.  Bin Laden was angry that Saudi Arabia had declined his offer to fight Saddam (who only recenlty concluded his decade long war with Iran, had just overrun Kuwait with particular brutality, and was now talking about how certain parts of Saudi territory were stolen from Iraq..) and had instead invited the United States to deal with the threat of Iraq.  The last thing the Saudis wanted was a bunch of armed groups coming into Saudi Arabia whose motivations were murky at best; history is replete with examples of religious forces turning on their leaders when they feel the leaders are lacking in faith- and there was plenty of risk that any number of these holy warriors might try to claim the throne for themselves. The motivations of the United States were crystal clear -protect the flow of oil- and it would be extremely unlikely for any American general to decide to try to overthrow the monarchy.  If Bin Laden's primary focus was with the US and Israel, he wouldn't have waited until after the Saudi government refused his offer of assistance to declare his jihad against the United States. [In 1994 Saudi government basically told Bin Laden that he was a dead man if he ever turned up in Saudi Arabia.](https://partners.nytimes.com/library/world/africa/041094binladen.html)  For Bin Laden, it was about jealousy and personal pride.. No. Bin Laden was pissed that Americans were based on Saudi soil, which he considered holy. This is much more about imaginary sports than *you* think.  Bark Qaeda  Iran is literally the only exception though. All the other countries are currently in a civil war or have territory occupied by terrorists.   I suspect the Iranian regime doesn't cooperate with the US on visa issues The ban did not include dual citizens, student visas, or green card holders. It was also passed and execute after consulting with congress, the joint chiefs, and national security agencies. It was passed due to those groups agreeing that there was a credible threat at the time.  > So then why is this travel ban so egregious?  because it was without warning and it effected residents who have been vetted  > If BO initiated the ban during his presidency  there was no ban?  ""[O]n December 18, 2015, the President signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2016, which includes the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 (the Act). The Act, among other things, establishes new eligibility requirements for travel under the VWP. These new eligibility requirements do not bar travel to the United States. Instead, a traveler who does not meet the requirements must obtain a visa for travel to the United States, which generally includes an in-person interview at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate.""  https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/visit/visa-waiver-program.html  i think most people would agree that sounds nothing like what trump has issued. It was hard to vet but possible, less than 1 percent made it through and it was helping people. Also the ban is bad because it's keeping legal residents from coming home. A family friend can't go to Iran to see his father before he dies because if he leaves the US he can't come back in.  The list wasn't made for banning, the list was basically made so the BO administration can do double checking. Trump took it to the extreme by actually banning US residents.   Here is neutral politics' explanation for you: https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/5qu5ho/whats_the_difference_between_trumps_travel_ban/dd26bw0/  Tl;dr: the difference is both simple, and large. **Obama's 2015 act didn't ban anyone.** It just added an interview to vet people from Iraq before they could obtain a visa. **Trump's recent order goes far beyond that to an actual ban of permanent residents and immigrants.** It's probably the indefinite detention, as well as Trump not checking with the legal eagles whether this is feasible. That and he rarely briefs any of his staff about the EOs he writes, just kinda fires them off then tells his staff about them. Matthis was briefed on the travel ban when Trump was televising it, for example. I can't think why the military advisor would be kept in the dark over an order that stops translators being allowed into America. I thought obama just changed visa requirements?   In any case, trump stated multiple times he was in favor of a complete and total shutdown of muslims entering the country. Everybody knows that's what he wanted.  It's not an oversight if it was intentional, and reiterated by the White House when DHS wanted to not apply it to current green card holders. Can you explain the difference between green cards and visas and how that differentiates Obama's and Trump's policies for someone who is woefully ignorant. There's two things. First is that Obama slowed down the intake of Iraqi refugees for a period after we found fingerprints of two people we let in on an IED in Iraq. The two individuals were arrested and we slowed down Iraqi immigration until the IED forensics backlog could be cleared and we could verify we weren't letting in terrorists.  EDIT: THIS PART ISN'T TRUE  ~~The 7 countries thing comes from an Obama directive that those countries were dangerous for westerners to *visit* and had nothing to do with immigration.~~  http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/30/donald-trump/why-comparing-trumps-and-obamas-immigration-restri/ From ForeignPolicy.com:   **Scope:** The Obama administration conducted a review in 2011 of the vetting procedures applied to citizens of a single country (Iraq) and then only to refugees and applicants for Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs), created by Congress to help Iraqis (and later Afghans) who supported the United States in those conflicts. The Trump executive order, on the other hand, applies to seven countries with total population more than 130 million, and to virtually every category of immigrant other than diplomats, including tourists and business travelers.  **Rationale:** The Obama administrations 2011 review came in response to specific threat information, including the arrest in Kentucky of two Iraqi refugees, still the only terrorism-related arrests out of about 130,000 Iraqi refugees and SIV holders admitted to the United States. Thus far the Trump administration has provided no evidence, nor even asserted, that any specific information or intelligence has led to its draconian order.  **Impact:** Contrary to Trumps Sunday statement and the repeated claims of his defenders, the Obama administration did not ban visas for refugees from Iraq for six months. For one thing, refugees dont travel on visas. More importantly, while the flow of Iraqi refugees slowed significantly during the Obama administrations review, refugees continued to be admitted to the United States during that time, and there was not a single month in which no Iraqis arrived here. In other words, while there were delays in processing, there was no outright ban.  **Process:** The Obama administrations review was conducted over roughly a dozen deputies and principals committee meetings, involving Cabinet and deputy Cabinet-level officials from all of the relevant departments and agencies  including the State, Homeland Security and Justice Departments  and the intelligence community. The Trump executive order was reportedly drafted by White House political officials and then presented to the implementing agencies a fait accompli. This is not just bad policymaking practice, it led directly to the confusion, bordering on chaos, that has attended implementation of the order by agencies that could only start asking questions (such as: does this apply to green card holders?) once the train had left the station.  **Far stronger vetting today:** Much has been made of Trumps call for extreme vetting for citizens of certain countries. The entire purpose of the Obama administrations 2011 review was to enhance the already stringent vetting to which refugees and SIV applicants were subjected. While many of the details are classified, those rigorous procedures, which lead to waiting times of 18-24 months for many Iraqi and Syrian refugees, remain in place today and are continually reviewed by interagency officials. The Trump administration is, therefore, taking on a problem that has already been (and is continually being) addressed.  **The notorious seven countries:** The White Houses claim that the seven countries listed in the executive order came from the Obama administration is conveniently left unexplained. A bit of background shows that Trump is borrowing from a totally different context: soon after the December 2015 terror attack in San Bernadino, Obama signed an amendment to the Visa Waiver Program, a law that allows citizens of 38 countries to travel to the United States visa-free (and gives Americans reciprocal privileges in those countries). The amendment removed from the Visa Waiver Program dual nationals who were citizens of four countries (Iraq, Iran, Sudan, and Syria), or anyone who had recently traveled to those countries. The Obama administration added three more to the list (Libya, Somalia, and Yemen), bringing the total to seven. But this law did not bar anyone from coming to the United States. It only required a relatively small percentage of people to obtain a visa first. And to avoid punishing people who clearly had good reasons to travel to the relevant countries, the Obama administration used a waiver provided by Congress for certain travelers, including journalists, aid workers, and officials from international organizations like the U.N.  **Bottom line:** No immigration vetting system is perfect, no matter how extreme. Obama often said that his highest priority was keeping Americans safe. In keeping with Americas tradition and ideals, he also worked to establish a vetting system that worked more fairly and efficiently, particularly for refugees who are, by definition, in harms way. Trump should defend his approach on the merits, if he can. He should not compare it to his predecessors Isn't the point of 'America First' to not care about building Syria and Libya? Are not refugees supposed to return to their country when things get better? The Middle East is very different to Central Africa. Civil wars have occurred before, and those countries weren't 'rebuilt' by warlords. UAE probably just plans to build a pipeline through Syria for Natural Gas into Europe. A big threat to Russian exports and a reason for the Russian intervention in Syria. Assad was against this pipeline, and suddenly there is a civil war. I am not saying that its the literal cause, it could be coincidence, but damn its so fitting and there is a lot of mystery about multiple, different, groups of armed people before the start of the civil war.   Here is an article that goes over that pipeline a bit, but is more history based than that. Also, written by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and published on Politico, a really good read:  http://www.politico.eu/article/why-the-arabs-dont-want-us-in-syria-mideast-conflict-oil-intervention/ Most Muslims outside of the ME (or from the ME) don't identify as either, just Muslim. Their beliefs tend to fall in line with Sunnis though Of course not. The documentation infrastructure is mostly gone.  However, are we supposed to ignore the plight of refugees because the war was so bad that it destroyed their government infrastructure?  That seems somewhat absurd. That's not what the person you're replying to said, at all.  I'll restate it  At some point a moderate Muslim might think the USA is out to get Muslims.  In addition to the movie, I would highly recommend reading [A Theory of the Drone](https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Drone-Grgoire-Chamayou/dp/1595589759) by Grgoire Chamayou. It raises several ethical implications of drone use that I have never seen addressed anywhere else or in the media despite the abundent op-eds on the subject.  I wonder if Iran was tacked on by the GOP.  There are some serious grudges against Iran stage right.  While the Obama peace with Iran is amazing, had McCain won in 2008, it is very likely we'd be at war with them.    I wonder how this list came to be, and how much thought and consideration went into it?   Could it be for funding certain groups? Yeah for the fact that they funded the militias that killed US soldiers in Iraq and have funded and worked with ISIS and are testing ballistic missiles in violation of the treaty Obama gave to them along with billions of dollars in cash and an end to decades of sanctions. They're a theocratic autocracy and the world's #1 sponsor of terror. A 90 day ban on travel is pretty much the least we could do.  The Iranian government and the US government really don't have diplomatic relationships  A lot of Trump supporters feel taking out Hussein or going into Iraq in general was a mistake.   It really is a bummer, it was one of the strongest militaries in the world and provided a lot of stability to the region and we ruined it.  Regarding dual citizens, at least if you're Canadian, then it's [not a problem apparently](https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/01/28/passport-holders-of-7-muslim-majority-countries-cant-board-air-canada-flights-to-us.html). Why do you say it was passed after consultation, while everyone else says it was not well consulted and almost no one knew of it? That makes it worse (to me). >The 7 countries thing comes from an Obama directive that those countries were dangerous for westerners to visit and had nothing to do with immigration.  First part is correct, but this is a little off.  http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/how-the-trump-administration-chose-the-7-countries/  >In December 2015, President Obama signed into law a measure placing limited restrictions on certain travelers who had visited Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or Syria on or after March 1, 2011. Two months later, the Obama administration added Libya, Somalia, and Yemen to the list, in what it called an effort to address ""the growing threat from foreign terrorist fighters.""  >The restrictions specifically limited what is known as visa-waiver travel by those who had visited one of the seven countries within the specified time period. People who previously could have entered the United States without a visa were instead required to apply for one if they had traveled to one of the seven countries.  >Under the law, dual citizens of visa-waiver countries and Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or Syria could no longer travel to the U.S. without a visa. Dual citizens of Libya, Somalia, and Yemen could, however, still use the visa-waiver program if they hadn't traveled to any of the seven countries after March 2011.    [Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015](https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/visit/visa-waiver-program.html)    [DHS Announces Further Travel Restrictions for the Visa Waiver Program](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/02/18/dhs-announces-further-travel-restrictions-visa-waiver-program)  So as far as I can tell the Obama Administration did place travel restrictions on these same 7 countries (and not ""9/11"" countries like Saudi Arabia).  The difference is the Trump administration directly cited 9/11 as a reason for the bans, whereas Obama never claimed the restrictions were anything to do with 9/11 specifically, and wasn't an all-out ban anyway. Wow, that is way different, why are they being so misleading? >The 7 countries thing comes from an Obama directive that those countries were dangerous for westerners to visit and had nothing to do with immigration.  As far as I know, this is incorrect.  You can read about the criteria for choosing those countries [here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1187), and it doesn't have anything to do with the degree of danger associated with visiting there.  edit: TLDR: Iraq and Syria are specifically included as well as countries that support international terrorism, are a safe haven for terrorists, countries that have a significant presence of terrorists, and countries that an alien's presence in increases likelihood that they are a credible threat to the US.  At least that was the criteria. That's the beauty of nationalism -- it never makes sense, it's always about directing anger towards a specific group of people. Not helping anyone but the US or France or whichever country is of course bad for isolationism because helping them rebuild helps you in the long run by making sure people stay in their countries instead of fleeing to the west. Yes and no. When it comes to Syria specifically, it is in the best interest of the United States that the country is rebuilt with functioning, stable governance. Removing space from a Caliphate-shaped organisation with a purpose of bringing down the United States is the perfect example of acting in the interests of America through foreign aid. I think thats oversimplifying it. I believe the point isn't to say ""screw all other countries, America!"" But more that we should take care of all the terrible shit closer to home before we go spending a ton of money elsewhere. Obviously some people take this too far. My heart goes out to anyone who has to flee their country, but as a veteran I also question the military age males who are fleeing their country while expecting others to come fight in their stead.   That the skilled people who are applying for asylum (not that all of them are) will be in danger, or at least be stuck in a situation were their skills aren't going to be utilized effectively so it's all moot.  This assumed 'rebuilding' could be taking place in 30 years for all we know so arguing that they should hang around just to help out is a bit detached from their reality. > Assad was against this pipeline, and suddenly there is a civil war.   I used to believe in this theory, but it has massive holes. There's no proof Assad was ever against it for one. Secondly, the US was spending money on a tv program talking about propaganda against the government in Syria, in 2008. That was before any of the countries involved in this theory decided upon building a pipeline.   The United States was also funding rebels in Syria shortly before the pipleines were discussed. The whole reason behind this whole civil war is much simpler than this theory. Imperialism. American, and Russian imperialism. One wants to overthrow an authoritarian government, so they can set up a puppet, like usual. The other wants to keep an authoritarian government on their side, and in their pocket.  This shit is just history getting an expansion pack of the cold war. > However, are we supposed to ignore the plight of refugees because the war was so bad that it destroyed their government infrastructure?  No, I'd support putting them in safe zones in Syria. Just not letting them into America. I apologise, perhaps I didn't quite grasp what was being said. I very much agree with your understanding of the situation. I thought we were in agreement; to be honest, I'm not sure where our opinions diverge.  I mean, I'm not even muslim, nor do I live in the Middle East, but it certainly looks like the US is out to get Muslims.  Islam is the only current religion that you have to worry about its members getting mad and blowing something up. Maybe there is a problem with Islam.  Again... What about Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Lebanon? Like Saudi Arabia funds Al Qaeda? > worked with ISIS   Iran is a Shia theocracy, ISIS is a Sunni Caliphate. They do not work together.  I don't dispute your other claims but the idea that Iran funded and worked with Isis is obviously false.  Iran is a Shia country and Isis is a Wahhabi organization seeking to overthrow Iran's allies in (Shia controlled) Iraq and Assad in Syria.  Iran has been allied with Russia in supporting Assad against Isis and free Syrian army. the greatest mistake was banning the Baath party from jobs.  Something like 80k-100k jobs were dropped because the workers were of the ""ruling"" party.  Teachers, doctors, you name it, they were out of work once the US came in, circa 2003, the second time.   That was a mistake that has made things unimaginably worse in that nation.  If we had done things normally, the Baath party might have stayed in power and cooler heads may have prevailed in Iraq over time.    Removing Saddam was nasty, but seemed almost necessary.  Once we had invaded Iraq once, and then Clinton sat on it for a solid 8 years with no fly zones and sanctions, something was going to give and it wasn't going to be pretty.    We should have let all that move organically, however.  Just looking at ISIS, anything left in Iraq would have been better than what we have now.   As a dual citizen, let's just say I'm not too excited to go to the states for a while. -.- It wasn't a ban at all. It was 'you gotta get a visa like most of the people in the world' if you've visited these seven countries in the past 5 years. Frankly, this was kind of dumb and driven by the hysteria of the Paris attacks, but once again, it was nothing like Trump proposed. Good to know. Appreciate the info. Except for Iran, this was in response to specific intelligence and threats.  In 2015, Iraq and Syria were involved with ISIS and the Syrian Civil War.  We did not want Americans traveling there, training with ISIS or others and returning to carry out attacks here.  Yemen was in its internal conflict, which I guess we can call a civil war, so similar situation.  Libya overthrew Gadaffi several years earlier and is unstable, with both local militia (like the one that attacked the US compounds in Benghazi) and some outside groups like ISIS (though not as much in 2015 as today.)  Somalia is an unstable mess where some Somali-Americans have traveled and worked with local militia.  Sudan is in conflict with South Sudan, plus general human rights abuses such as in Darfur.  Iran is the oddball.  I don't recall the sequence of the nuclear arms treaty negotiations, but the inclusion of Iran on this list may have been to increase pressure on Tehran during the negotiations.  And as has been said, this was not a ban, but rather a move to require more stringent screenings of travelers and was largely based on specific problems and intelligence.  Also, unlike the Trump implementation which makes an exception for ""religious minorities"" from majority Muslim countries, making ban clearly targeting Muslims (and the political context), the Obama visa change did not target travelers based on their religion.  Trump is bullshit.  Trump supporters citing this are full of shit. Because not many people get facts from credible or the original source anymore, liberals and conservatives alike.   Ever played a game of ""telephone"" when you were a kid?   That is why things become so misleading. Because the truth doesn't fit their narrative.  ""alternative facts""  If you overwhelm the public with differing opinions and ""facts"", then at a certain point the people won't know what or who to believe, allowing you to do whatever you want.  That's their hope anyway. My hope is that in this age of information, it will become possible to vet out the fake from the real. Yea this is why Prince Charles' comments on ""forgetting the lessons of WWII"" are so poigniant  After WWII we rebuilt Japan, now it's one of our greatest allies.  We rebuilt Germany.  Another of our greatest allies.  We rebuilt England and France.  More great allies. It makes as little sense as Trump attempting to thwart companies seeking to build new factories in Mexico. If he genuinely wants to reduce immigration from Mexico then economic development is a GOOD thing.  You're fundamentally misunderstanding nationalism. A nationalist can be of the opinion that brain drain is bad and that people should better their own countries. Americans put America first, Syrians put Syria first, ect. There's no contradiction there.    > My heart goes out to anyone who has to flee their country, but as a veteran I also question the military age males who are fleeing their country while expecting others to come fight in their stead.  How many people who actually seek refuge from war-torn countries want the US Army to come in and sort their shit for them? Aside, or course, from the ones that bring up that it is for the most part America's fault that the country is destabilised to begin with. Are you aware that large parts of Syria are suffering significant drought and famine?  That this caused a mass migration to the cities, which they couldn't handle which was a significant factor in the uprising against  Assad?  Now tell me more about these safe areas in  Syria which are able to handle massive refugee populations. Tbh, I think he/she misunderstood your comment.  Me neither, you two seem to be making the same point  He/she may have misunderstood/misread your 'wouldn't' as 'would'.  Sometimes contractions are misread/misheard (at least for some).   If we're banning people for supporting Assad does that mean we'll he banning Russia as well for being their biggest backers? Don't forget Hezbollah, which is indisputably a terrorist organization.  Seriously can someone ELI5 why these countries weren't included, or is there simply just no explanation? It makes the whole thing seem very contradictory.  All 3 of which are strong allies  I think the reasoning is (with the exception of Iran, which was included for other reasons I presume) the countries included are in a state of civil unrest  I had to get a visa to be in Europe for more than 3 months. People don't seem to understand the difference between eliminating visa waivers and eliminating access to the country at all.  I don't even know who were talking about anymore. So many different 'theys' and narratives. Turns out that the internet is the literal million monkeys on a typewriter sort of information. To be fair, a lot of these countries we are trying to rebuild aren't receptive to the West rebuilding them. It's a very different situation to post WW2. The population of Iraq is no Japan. Yeah, but counterpoint, you're neglecting the first time we beat Germany and DIDN'T rebuild them and our motto was ""America First"" and we didn't want to get involved in Europe's problems and nationalism was on the rise everywhere and our stock market boomed and then everything was fine and America was great. So, maybe we'll just do that again. We also didn't help rebuild the USSR (which did almost all of the heavy lifting for the allies) despite aid promises and we all know how that turned out Yep putting tariffs on mexican imports can possibly cause economic downturn in Mexico causing more Mexicans to leave. Also consumers will be paying for the tariffs i.e. Americans paying for the products.  You say that like the US aids other countries for selfless reasons when in fact it's entirely to the benefit of their own country.  And you're misunderstanding what I'm saying. If you love your country, you can recognize that the best way to help it is to help develop other countries as it will benefit you in the long run as well. This is the entire basis of the EU and that has been working fine for the past 60 years. Haha. VGamer understands nationalism rather brilliantly.   To create nationalism.  1) Create an enemy.  2) Claim your country is better off alone.   The contradiction I thought was apparent. To not help Syria (or act only Nationalist stand point) will harm america.   I worry about your comment. Its the dangerous short sightedness of all too many right now.  Are you aware that [ten refugees can be supported in a culturally-compatible neighboring country for what it costs to support one refugee in a western country](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/syrian-refugees-will-cost-ten-times-more-to-care-for-in-europe-than-in-neighboring-countries-a6928676.html)?  > A budget of $3,000 per refugee in Jordan would provide food, water, education and opportunity. In Germany this will cost $30,000 Ahh that's a very good point, I always forget how easy it is to misinterpret stuff written on the internet. Thanks

Hah ""separatists"".  Right.   Russian Army more like it.  Russia attacked Avdiivka, not ""pro-Russian separatists"". Russia attacking avdiivka? Seems like Russia have decided to go A long There is a big difference between and ""attack"" and an exchange of ordinance. Do we know if there are actual offensive actions going on or they're just bombarding each other? It can't be true.  I remember candidate Trump telling Stephanopolous that Putin wouldn't go into Ukraine on his watch.  Of course, that was right after Donnie told him he Putin wouldn't go in at all - a year after he did Are we going to address the elephant in the room? The illegal coup of Ukrainian government?  Because that shit legitimised civil unrest across the entire country. Bullshit. Anti-trump propaganda This is a good thing... I don't know a single American who actually understands what's going on in Ukraine... Everyone's like ""oh no big bad Putin is coming to take Ukraine"" yet nobody ever talks about how Ukraine is being run by criminals and terrorists or the fact that Ukraine is filled with mostly Russian people. Clearly the Ukraine army capturing new territory in the area and advancing towards the rebel lines is completely unrelated.   > since mid-December Ukraine's armed forces have edged farther into parts of the gray zone in or near the war-worn cities of Avdiivka, Debaltseve, Dokuchaievsk, Horlivka, and Mariupol, shrinking the space between them and the separatist fighters.  > In doing so, the pro-Kyiv troops have sparked bloody clashes with their enemy, which has reportedly made advances of its own -- or tried to -- in recent weeks.  > ""The direct result of forward moves is escalation in tension, which often turns to violence,"" Alexander Hug, the principal deputy chief monitor of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Special Monitoring Mission (OSCE SMM) to Ukraine, had told RFE/RL prior to his visit.  See http://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-creeping-offensive-escalation-fighting/28268104.html It is?  Tell me why it's obvious. There is nothing obvious about it. Th conflict started years ago and Obama was still in power so ""Putin waiting for Obama to leave office"" makes no sense at all. Clearly he was afraid of another red line. So obvious. /s [removed] how dare you to bring facts into reddit! Well it's seperatisist in the Ukraine. It's rebels in Syria. It's secret agencys in the US. It's hackers in Russia or China. It's president in the turkey. It's dictator in Syria. We sell weapons to freedom fighters and later kill them as extremists.  Good thing that the 'we', the west, are always on the side of justice. It would be really confusing otherwise. Gotta fight all this fucking evilness.  Ukrainians liberating Ukrainian territory from Russian invaders? How dare they! I know Americans are fat, but that doesn't mean everything in the world revolves around them. I guess this is a mirror image of Putin's formative ""Moscow is silent"" moment. Shit, if only there were say, like 100 other countries in the world capable of doing something about it. Or a collection of European states, formed into an organization to promote international co-operation could do something about it.  I think we'll be seeing a number of people and places taking advantage of America's situation. Instability will be on the rise. of course blame putin , russia is responsible for everything even that mosquito that bit your right cheek last night. Donetsk is not under Putin's control. Putin sold guns for a profit in 2014 and 2015, but that has since halted since Donetsk supports groups that want Putin dead. The border between the two countries has since been militarized and pretty much a constant stand-off.  Donetsk's full of communists, they absolutely hate Putin as bourgeoisie. > Pro-Russians are bombing own locations in Ukraine?  One can't make reasonable conclusions from meaningless questions. Of course those who are bombing don't bomb themselves. But false flag operations are nothing new.  They assume no one will use critical thought like that when making these headlines. Half of them aren't even pro-russian. Some are but a lot ain't.  A lot of the Donetsk, Luhansk groups are separate from everyone type separatists and old school communists with a side smattering of war tourists/free militias and mercs whilst on the pro Kiev side there's the regular conscripts, even more free militias (azov battalion etc) and more mercs.  The whole area is a fucking mess but you'll never see it described that way in the news.  It's always the plucky Ukrainian army successfully *fending off* pro-russian/russian supported and supplied separatists or just basically ""the russians"". (since that's apparently how The Russians^TM work now ~ not like the massive hammer their military is designed as like you seen in Georgia but invisibly, without artillery and air support)  >own locations  No they bomb government-controlled Avdeevka. A good number of ISIS propagandists are *actual British citizens*. I was going to say: pro-Russian or actual Russian? Right? Ever since this happened years ago I've been sort of outraged that the mainstream media goes so far out of their way to keep from calling this the Russian invasion that it is. Russian soldiers appear to be sitting this one out. Donetsk is an actual seperatist movement, not pro-Russian at all. They're actually geared up to defend themselves from a Russian invasion at all times these days.  Either way, soldiers from Donetsk are rather diverse. Yes there's some ex Russian army (mainly communists since.. well that's the ideology of Donetsk), but also people from China, Germany, Poland, Spain, Italy, Canada, the USA, Brazil, etcetera.  I've heard the western soldiers have trouble with cloth machinegun belts. Yep, the Ukrainian military is invading its own country. /s Its almost as if overthrowing their government with an anarchistic coup was a bad idea. But hey, make your bed, lie in it. America did plenty going in there and instigating an illegal overthrow of a democratically elected government.  Why don't Americans overthrow their *own* government first? Most of them fled to Russia, who I believe took in nearly a million.  Because they aren't Muslim. Zakharchenko, Givi, Mosgovoi(RIP), Khodakovsky local leaders of local groups Oplot(miners), Prizrak(seem like old commies). Khodakovsky was in the police's alpha group under Yanukovitch. I make it local rebels make up about 70-80%, the rest from Russian, Serb and other smaller numbers of volunteers - even Spanish, Italian and Brazilian leftists joining Prizrak at times, or Vostok. I think there will be some Spetsnaz but no major numbers of official Russian forces, just comms and specialists but I think if there was a sudden breakthrough Russian forces would be fed in.  Thing is there most of the people in this region are sort of Russian and feel Russian, if the Ukrainian state was thinking of removing language rights and imposing Ukrainisation on them they wouldnt and obv. werent happy about it. WW2 is the major split with some believing in the Russian ideal of crushing Hitler and facism and others in the Ukrainian Bandera who threw his hand in with Hitler. Its the same in Yugoslavia, Serbs in Bosnia or Kosovo or Croats in Bosnia dont automatically become or feel Bosnian, they are left behinds, like Russians in Ukraine after USSR split.  Russian army is sitting right over the border, RF personnel in Donbass are there in advisory and logistical roles. You'll know right away when they show up in force. I don't think the Russian Army is doing most of the fighting, I think it's the separatists however I do think the Russians are close by and willing to help when things get a bit rough for the separatists. Ukraine's forces have actually been on a creeping offensive for the last few weeks, and separatists have been losing territory.  Hold your propaganda horses! What exactly is the difference between a legal coup and a illegal one? maybe, trump is no fan of western meddling in ukraine that started this whole thing off in the first place. i wouldnt want to be an ukrainian soldier right about now, i think their support from nato and america is gonna dry up pretty quickly Do you think you're some kind of hot ""rapper""!? Bwahahaha.  Keep trying. > Ukraine is filled with mostly Russian people.  That's the stupidest thing I've read today. It's like saying Mexico is filled with mostly Spanish people.   They're Ukrainians and they have the right to self determination. Not buying it, Ivan.  >...or the **fact** that Ukraine is filled with mostly Russian people.   I agree with you.. but by that logic Russia I filled with Africans. **In fact** 100% of Russians are African so I call on Russia to capitulate immediately - they don't get to have self-determination outside of what Africa allows/dictates.  Nice try, Ruski.        How many rubles do you make per post? > This is a good thing... I don't know a single American who actually understands what's going on in U**K**raine... Everyone's like ""oh no big bad Putin is comin**G** to take Ukraine"" yet no**B**ody ever talks about how Ukraine is being run by criminals and terrorists or the fact that Ukraine is filled with mostly Russian people.   My favorite part is that the article refers to the Ukrainian army as ""pro-Kyiv troops"" while the Russian army and its proxies (majority Russian mercenaries, with local quislings) are ""separatist fighters."" Somewhere out there, Orwell can't decide whether to laugh or cry. You mean THEIR TERRITORY?  You know, that Russia totally didn't invade US-Contra style? Do you mean they may, >gasp<, try to retake their territory? So you are saying shelling civilians with MRLs based [literally in between residential areas of Donetsk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSXQvbRRJ_8) ([pic](http://uaposition.com/file/2017/01/sheeling-Avdiyivka-from-Donetsk.jpg), there are more videos if you like) and endangering a population of between ten and sixteen thousands by death from temperatures down to -20C is an adequate retaliation to Ukrainian government troops attempting to gain control of the demarkation line as it was drawn in existing agreements? > capturing new territory  You mean operating in existing Ukrainian territory. If you ignore that they were already fighting in the area a day before the phone call.   > The SMM recorded more ceasefire violations [1] in Donetsk region, including about 420 explosions, compared with 228 in the previous reporting period. **More than 160 explosions were recorded around the Svitlodarsk area, with exchanges of fire also recorded around Avdiivka and Yasynuvata.**  See http://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/295996 Stop smoking conspiracy-theory-crack.  Donald: ""Hi putin! Bomb ukraine now!"" Putin: ""Gotcha bro!""  Only in your mind did that call have anything to do with this. He was too afraid of Obama. Had to wait for his puppet. Missiles are flying at Ukrainian towns.   Bombing has resumed. This time, without the pesky US to stand up to him, he's free to roam through Ukraine without worry of sanctions. https://impassenews.wordpress.com/2016/07/30/dont-believe-that-russia-is-actively-supporting-a-trump-presidency-follow-russias-trolls-and-propagandists-part-1/ There had been a cessation of hostilities for months, now it's heating up, just after Pres. Obama left office.  Seems obvious to me. Of course it does the heat to was too much with Obama and now there is no heat from his bromance.  Yeah! Can't you see how busy we are crying over the Russians stepping on the throats of those poor Ukrainians!  Pro-regime Ukrainians liberating Ukrainian territory from anti-regime Ukrainians. And yes, it's illegal to murder civilians. You orbit around me bitch Oh come on dude, you're talking about Russian imperial expansion into eastern Europe. That's revolved around US funding and military commitments since the day Nato was formed.  It pretty much does... If the  ""everything"" consists of pro russian seperatists then probably yeah. >russia is responsible for everything...  ...that happens in Eastern Ukraine. Yes, that is correct. The mosquito didn't annex Crimea and invade Ukraine, you dense motherfucker. There are many different people int heir ranks. From Brazilians to Spanish to Georgians fighting on ""pro russian"" side. All videos in liveleak. That's...completely irrelevant but okay... There are local Russians who are actually pro-Russian. Invading? They just bombing civilian districts like they did many times before.  There's no invasion here, lets be real here, that's just western propaganda because Euromaidan is euro-centric and thus convenient.  Donetsk is an actual seperatist movement of communist ideology. Russia sold guns to them in 2014 and 2015 to make a quick buck. Since then relations have chilled significantly as Donetsk supports groups intent on assassinating Putin.  They're actual people from the region who are very disillusioned with capitalism. You must understand, since 1991 the ex-soviet citizens suddenly became very poor. 12 years old girls commonly had to whore themselves out for food. Boys.. just starved, since they couldn't (usually). Either way, people are pissed, they revolt, bunch of Russians sell guns, and some others longing to communist times join up, west calls it an invasion. Yes how dare russia invade a country that's historically been apart of Russia with regions of majority ethnic Russian population that want to rejoin the motherland.  We just did. Russia is in charge here, too. Great. Hope they're safe. Bullshit, it's 50/50 to Russia and internal displacement in Ukraine. Russian media tended to overestimate numbers. Yeah, it's funny situation. Everyone claiming how Russia is bad and aggressor yet refugees comes here. Those would be the Russians that were living in Ukraine. Not Ukrainians.  Or because most are internal refugees or fled to russia +1 >Oplot(miners)  Gopniks from Kharkov mostly (EDIT: as resident of Kharkov I witnessed their appearance. and their attempts to take power in 2014. and how all their wealth and media support was coming from russia). Oplot was founded right before the war with strong anti-ukrainian and anti-western agenda. Russia knew it would attack long before revolution.  Prizrak was founded by guy who served in russian military and moved into Ukraine around 2010. Obvious sleeper cell.  Another ""leader"" Motorola was russian.  Initial leader - Strelkov - russian serviceman.  Initial political leader - Moscow PR guy. Everytime the ""rebels"" had a major offensive it was due to russian regulars entering eastern ukraine and pushing back the Ukrainian army.  Also, when they enter they tend to shoot down civilian airliners too. Legal coup is when NATO countries support it, illegal one is everyone else. Neither would I. Have you seen their ration packs?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGcJfqLP1HQ Go to Ukraine and come back and let me know about the russians By that logic everyone is African. Still doesn't mean Ukraine is full of Russians and is run by terrorists. I've heard that they are paid 12 rub per comment. Oh... myy... goddd....  ^^We're ^^doomed. This is a good thing... I don't k**n**ow a single American wh**o** actually under**s**tands what's going on in UKraine... Everyon**e**'s like ""oh no big bad Putin is cominG to take Ukrai**n**e"" yet noBody ever tal**k**s about how Ukraine is being run by criminals and terr**o**rists or the fact that Ukraine is filled with mostly Russian people.   My tax dollars are paying for this article, too. The Ukrainian army has been fighting alongside volunteer militias for most of the war. Because the Ukrainian army has little control over those militias the militias tend to be referred to as separate entities.   For example:  > In April 2015, the Ukrainian government appointed Governor of Luhansk Hennadiy Moskal stated that Aidar battalion was ""terrorizing the region"" and asked Ukrainian Defense Ministry to rein in its members after a series of thefts, including ambulances and the takeover of a bread factory  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aidar_Battalion  Aidar was technically part of the Ukrainian army since 2014 but it is often referred to as its own entity and the atrocities it has committed are not a reflection on the Ukrainian army.  It's both sides mate, hard conflict to read about. Ukrainians like to act like it's straight up Russian army brigades and nothing else fighting heroes who want to protect Ukrainian land. Russians like to act like it's unlawful troops from Western Ukraine taking the land of the poor people who live in those areas. As usual the truth is somewhere in the middle but depending on who you're talking to if you bring that up you're either a Russian or a Ukrainian spy.  You do understand that rferl is literally a US government's mouthpiece? I'm confused. What is it about calling them separatist fighters that's incorrect Yeah, except when information come out about those nazy batalions horrific crimes - like capturing people as hostages, torutring and raping them for months, delibirate killing of local populations, marauder and you know, just being open nazys - suddenly everybody remember - their are just volunteers, they are not part of Ukranian army and nobody in Kiev responsible for them.   Also - did you actualy was in Donetsk and count how many there russian army and how many locals? Cause you, seems to everybody who actualy goes there, can't find russian army at all.  Ok so, someone here with knowledge from and about the region:  The troops are not the Ukrainian standing military, but hired mercenaries as well as 'free brigades', freikorps may sound familiar to some. The latter of these groups, by the way, is kind of infamous for persecuting Jews, like, right now.  Donetsk is indeed seperatists, not pro-Russian. As evident from the militarized border between Russia and Donetsk, as well as Donetsk supporting groups within Russia that are intent on disposing the current ruling class. They're communists, something inconvenient and even dangerous to Putin. This is the way it's been reported since Russia first invaded. Even when countless stories came out proving they were Russian soldiers, the MSM still called them ""Separatists."" It's horrible. No matter what your political direction, the MSM is *all* fucked. Talk all the crap  you want about Fox, CNN is just as ridiculous, and vice versa.   Russia has grown balls that it needs more states under to support. Yes, but the separatists obviously feel differently and have the military power to back that up or they wouldn't exist anymore. So one side creeping is going to bring a response. As justified as it may be them trying to reclaim territory (It is not justified, it goes against the Minsk agreement but W/E it is understandable) they cannot act surprised when their attempts to do so gets a response and should not pretend that that response is not a direct consequence of them tying to do so. It's not their territory the same whay Scotland isn't England's territory. I mean that they are brazenly violating the Minsk II ceasefire agreement.   Personally I don't know why Ukraine's allies even bother pretending that Russia, and only Russia, is instigating this war when it is so obvious that Ukraine is responsible for this bout of fighting.  Then why reports of dead civilians come only from Donetsk where they die daily and you don't care ?  Also you do realise that power lines got damaged because Ukraine started this offence as OSCE reports ?  And Avdiivka was getting elecricity from ""separatist territory"", if they wanted to freeze the city they could just turn the switch like Ukraine did with whole Crimea mid winter. He means ""breaking Minsk II treaty that Poroshenko signed"". I still don't understand why Trump is a puppet  [removed] Other Ukrainians (those in Donbass) has complained about aggression from Kiev for some time.  Maybe it's the Ukrainians that are taking advantage of the situation.  Disclaimer: I honestly don't know who started this round of aggression.  Actually, no. There has continually been a low level of conflict with skirmishes ever since the last flare-up when the ""cease fire"" was agreed to.  Your US press were too frigging busy with your election circus to cover it though.  However, isn't is a nice coincidence that it is flaring up again after Obama leaves office, and after discussions between Trump and Poutin. Russian soldiers are not Ukrainian civilians. Russian mercenaries (a huge portion of the DNR/LNR are not Ukrainian civilians). Ukrainians who picked up arms against the state, to help Russia take over Ukrainian territory, are not civilians. Killing any of the above groups doesn't meet any legal definition of murder - by any sane definition, it's defense of the state.   https://windowoneurasia2.blogspot.ca/2015/09/dnr-poll-finds-population-doesnt.html  >  Despite what many would expect, Moskovsky komsomolets reported,**the majority of the people in the region were not against the Ukrainian Maidan and for the DNR, and although the agency with pride reports that the number of such people in recent times has increased by seven percent, that brings the number only to 29 percent**, that is, not even half.  You can contrast that against Chechnya, where Russia decimated a population that really did want their own state. Yeah this guys got a point here. If you don't see any correlation between the shady election of Donald Trump, and Putin stepping up his geopolitical power grab agenda, well you are either too young or too uneducated to be someone who should vote in the first place. Not just rebel positions, a friend of mine had their house shelled a while back. A ukrainian bomb killed a Donetsk politician a while back too, right in the appartment complex he lived.. killing many civilians. Ukraine blames the deaths on the politician they assassinated, saying he was putting all those people at risk by just.. living among his constituents. Fighting for your country sucks in many ways, I'm sure. But people complaining that countrymen are fighting the invasion would be annoying on top of all the fighting, and dying, and plight that goes along with war. > Ukraine has broke the ceasefire numerous times  According to who, if I may ask? Ceasefire was broken by russian regular forces advancing on Debaltsevo the day it was signed. > Ukraine has broke the ceasefire numerous times.   ""ceasefire"" LOL You're invading THEIR LAND, no such thing as a 'ceasefire' until you LEAVE. Classic propaganda.  Those districts are filled with Russian aggressors.  So really I don't give a shit, get your fucking ass out of their country.

The volunteer militias has been fighting alongside the Ukrainian army for the most of the war. Amount of volunteers engaged in fights is minuscule compared to a contingent of roughly 50-60 thousand regular troops.  > The Ukrainian army has been fighting alongside volunteer militias for most of the war. Because the Ukrainian army has little control over those militias the militias tend to be referred to as separate entities.  At this point, the volunteer battalions are overseen by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. They are effectively part of the Ukrainian army. Calling them pro-Kyiv forces is absurd on a number of levels. For one thing, they are not ""pro-Kyiv,"" but fighting on behalf of Ukraine. Second, to call them ""forces"" de-legitimizes their status as part of Ukraine's military.  > atrocities it has committed   Taking over a bread factory without authorization and random thefts are unacceptable actions from a military entity, but to call them ""atrocities"" is a bit of a stretch, isn't it? This is like the U.S. deciding it owns Baja California. So, the U.S. military comes in in unmarked vehicles and uniforms, then dresses up English speakers already living there in the same gear. Then they take over the state and call themselves ""Separatists.""  Like the whole "" you're either with me or against me"" I think the difference is that those ""unlawfu"" troops are fighting to restore their country not rebel or invade No, the truth is not in the middle. The majority of the ""separatist fighters"" actually are Russian army brigades. I understand that RFERL is US gov't-funded. That's why it's surprising that the language mirrors that of Kremlin propaganda channels. I also understand that the reporter, Chris Miller, is a former Kyivpost journalist, so you'd think he'd know better. > I'm confused. What is it about calling them separatist fighters that's incorrect  ""Separatist"" refers to Ukrainians who want to separate from Ukraine. How can a Russian (such as the Russian army and the mercenaries operating in Donbas) who wants to break off regions of Ukraine be called ""separatists?"" A ""separatist"" is, by definition, a local, who wants their territory to separate from their country.

Obviously they are hiding, it's an old communist tactics developed by KGB: to be seen in the world of information but can't be seen on UV and IR specter irl Yeah good analysis. Its definitely nuanced, factions within factions. Prizrak are commies, I think Vostok tend to have nationalist support. Strelkov I think isnt too happy that Putin didnt go all in and Dugan is a dark figure. For all the demonising in the west Putin is a sort of moderating, stable figure. If he is ousted I dont think the west has the same conditions it had when it helped Yeltsin get re elected, commies could make a come back or even Strelkov/Dugan which would be more dangerous, if even I know this I dont understand why we are so against Putin, but then I dont understand why we dont have a more neutral take on Assad either vs Sunnis. They don't have that power. Russia has that power, which they've loaned to them. Contra 2.0. I'll take ""False Equivalencies"" for 10! > I mean that they are brazenly violating the Minsk II ceasefire agreement.

That was a war against organizations like [Islamic International Brigade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_International_Brigade). And Ukrainian nazi-simpatizers from OUN/UPA were fighting on the side of jihadists.   And, please, tell me. Why did Ukrainian jets bombed Luhansk in June 2014? [NSFL video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1PDb668MrE). This is only one episode, you can find a lot if you will. Could you explain, WTF did Kiev expect after murdering civilians?   Fucking everyone? Have you not been paying attention? Neither side has been respecting the ceasefire, but Ukrainians have actually spent the last few weeks on a slow offensive. Ok, so one side is allowed to fight in the conflict but the other isn't? I mean that's a fine position to take, if you're for Ukraine breaking the ceasefire and going on the offensive more power to you. Just don't complain when the side they're fighting against pushes back. That's kind of the logical step to take for them... > Classic propaganda. Those districts are filled with Russian aggressors.  The lack of self-awareness is painful. It's not propaganda you ignorant idiots. I literally remember the first spring operations in 2014 with security cameras showing shells landing on parks and civilian losses. At the time nobody understood what was going on and media claimed ""accident"". Then it happened again and again. And Ukrainian government under Turchinov claimed Russian aggression and separatists shelling themselves. The fact that you stupid people cheer for post coup nationalist government makes me sick.  I wonder if you felt the same way about Assad bombing civilian districts in Aleppo? >irony  That right there is the propaganda, the only Russians in the area are the people who lived there since 1991, or people who came to Donetsk's aid after the initial revolt due to longing back to communist times. Donetsk is led by communists.  They absolutely hate Putin. But when Assad did it, everyone gone apeshit because he is an ally of Russia. Ask yourself how much you actually know about this conflict. I don't think Russians would mind at all. It would give them a great pretense to stomp Ukrainians and exact whatever concessions they wanted to in the aftermath. In the same vein, cold war planners would have *loved* it if Cubans launched an invasion of the US. Nothing like a good causus belli.   > How'd you like it if it was done to you (unidentified rebels propped up by a foreign regime causing shit in your sovereign territory)?  We already had this happened in Chechnya. With Saudi wahhabi emissars there. We annihilated them all. Its actually not most Russian soldiers. Its Russian special ops and logistical support to Ukranian rebels.  Saying it is 100% Russian soldiers just illustrates how ignorant to the nuanced nature of the this conlict you are. All of those lines on the map are ultimately imaginary and backed by force. If you can't keep it, it ain't yours.  Russians never joke. Well, we're on reddit, so. Reread that for a second. Now think of it the Mexican military came over the border in unmarked vehicles with unmarked artillary in unmarked uniforms and armed all the Mexicans living in the United States. Then they started a ""civil war"" (actually just Mexicans vs. Americans), that would be seen as what it is, an invasion. The same thing happened in Ukraine. Russian military came in and armed all the Russians. It is not a civil war, it is a war between Russians and Ukrainians...otherwise known as an invasion. US and EU did, especially after EU guarantors turned their back on agreement of peaceful transition of power and just let mob to seize government buildings. Yeah, those Ukrainian Armies are extremely under financed, while the private battalions are well supported, they even got some nice freshly US made supplies. Yet they are responsible for massive pillaging, killing and raping civilians. Because ""its ok to kill those donetsk vatniks"" as [Poroshenko stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHWHqj8g7Bk)  That is the middle though, you've never seen claims on here that the entire separatist force is made up of Russian troops? Clearly that's not the case, Russian troops were used in several battles in a long civil war. Russian advisors are openly there assisting them. However, both LPR and DPR are local Ukrainain troops, most battalions are local Ukrainain troops, there are plenty civilians in the bunch and war tourists from other countries.   Do you see how that's not in the middle of there are no Russian troops and the separatist army is Russian troops?  > The majority of the ""separatist fighters"" actually are Russian army brigades.  That's fucking laughable, dude. See if you can find a single reputable source that would agree with you. Not even the most ""optimistic"" SBU dispatches are in that ballpark. So DNR and LNR occupied by Russian army brigades? Where are protests? Why people are not saying truth about it? They have internet there. Citation needed my friend... Because most videos from locals and that region implies otherwise.  The Ukrainian ""revolution"" was very unpopular in eastern Ukraine, the Kiev government banned entire political parties popular in eastern Ukraine. You really think pro-Russian separatists don't exist? Putin being bad does not make the government of Ukraine good.  So rebels do not exist in Syria, it's Turkish army soldiers then? tl,dr - ""East Ukraine has no locals. All the people living there pre-war desperately wanted to be ruled by West Ukraine despite voting for opposing party consistently for decades. When war broke out, they all immigrated to Kiev and since than East Ukraine was populated exclusively by Russian Military""  they call them separatists because the bulk of those forces are in fact locals wanted to be separate from the country. The same locals that have been protesting the aftermath of Maidan for like 6 months on the streets before this shit escalated to atual war.   Do you have a source for that? I realy don't believe you don't understand difference between ""military intelligence officers were operating in the country"" and ""there are russian army"", nobody can be that stupid. You just pretend not too. NATO officers there are too, openly, that means NATO invaded Ukraine?  As for story with Buryat soldier, it never was proofed by audio or video source. Article itself contains a lot of stupid shit, almost like it was made up by someone who is not actualy work with tank. Also guy in the interview was very badly injured, burned, how he could give a hour (of a few hours) long interview?  I'm pretty sure it's fake.   There is a pretty simple logic here. There was russian troops in Crimea - and how that goes? Ukranians couldn't even lift a finger, was defeated without actual shoots.  Same would have happenned in Donbass, if there would be actual russian army there. Well maybe not the same, but they would be fucked anyway. Also do you understand how army works, in general? That is complex shit - command centers, communication, bases, aviation, supply, etc. You can't hide this things. And you can just change it by desire, it is very complex. Alt this crap about hybrid war is just justification to bomb the hell out of civlian populations refused to accept goverment overthrow and nazys in power.  I give you $1000000, I might take it back if you annoy me. Do you have $1000000? Its moot, for now they have the power regardless of the source. Tell me what is wrong? Also the British manage to have secession votes without war while the ukrainian Government just sends in the military. [removed] Too bad you are not trying not to buy anyones propaganda.  Also if you think what constitutes propaganda is defined by whether it aligns with your opinion or not i am afraid to tell you that is not how it works. Me neither, but I sure as shit don't trust the Ukrainian government either.  That's why I said I don't know what is going on. I find it really hard to get reliable information from the area. There is an international observation force that documents aggression from both sides. Read that if you want the truth. What you said is absolute horseshit and the reverse of that where Ukraine is the sole aggressor is absolute horseshit.  How do you know its Russia propaganda? Because Ukraine and US intelligence say so? cough...wmd...cough...Iraq...cough... You don't have to. Soon it will come free with your taxes. You don't have to...Rt and Pravda will give it to you for free. January is the new spring guys there's videos of russians firing artillery next to apartment buildings, it's all fucked.  Luckily that was never said so nobody here is ignorant to the nuanced nature of this Russian invasion. :) The US and EU had nothing to do with it? What are you even ranting about? You expected the EU to come in and stop the protesters with force? You are lying. The speech in the video is lacking context and he did not said ""it's ok to kill"".  Sedition should indeed carry the death penalty.  That's because it's a lie. But wait a second and the guy is going to give you ""selfie soldiers"" video from Vice. That proves that Poroshenko is right and 50,000 Russian troops are there /s I love that you people try to use voting patterns as a proxy of what people in Eastern Ukraine want, when *every* poll indicates that the vast majority of the people in even the most pro-Russian regions of Ukraine, supports a unified Ukrainian state, and does not want to join Russia, nor to be controlled by Russia's puppet ""republics."" Go ahead and try to find some polls indicating that anything close to a majority of Donbas favors separatism or joining Russia. I'll wait...  https://windowoneurasia2.blogspot.ca/2015/09/dnr-poll-finds-population-doesnt.html  >  Despite what many would expect, Moskovsky komsomolets reported,**the majority of the people in the region were not against the Ukrainian Maidan and for the DNR, and although the agency with pride reports that the number of such people in recent times has increased by seven percent, that brings the number only to 29 percent**, that is, not even half.

Trust me if it were just an entire Russian brigade I think they would have more success than the Ukrainian rebels. What am I ""ranting"" about? I am talking about the timeline of Ukrainian crisis and how US and EU played a role in it. Everybody loves to point a dirt stick on Russia but nobody seems to be aware of US/EU role in it.   What am I expecting? I am expecting the so called ""civilized"" world not to meddle in Ukraine. You can send back Nuland, McCain, Biden back to where they came from instead of agitating people on Maidan. I also expect EU to take a more sane stance on economics instead of proposing ultimatums to Ukraine. Yanukovoch was offered a better deal with Russia, a MUCH better deal. EU insisted on ""choosing"" them or Russia instead. EU guarantors also signed an agreement on peaceful transition of power. in February '14, when the country could've been saved instead of getting chaotic. Not to mention that Obama and Putin spoke on the phone days earlier, with Obama assuring Russian leadership that everything will be fine and stay within legal framework instead of supporting psycho mob, or should I call them ""peaceful protesters"" with molotovs and guns. As peaceful as ""moderate rebels"" in Syria. So if these legal documents mean anything to the ""civilized"" world that portrays to be supreme and epitome of justice, liberty and democracy, then perhaps they should've honored it?   Now after all this and attempted assassination on LEGAL president of Ukraine. Everybody has a nerve to claim that nobody else but Russia played a role in this mess? Really? Crimea and South Eastern parts just decided to protest these events for the fuck of it or were they all under the gun of Russian special ops? Get a grip on reality.   I don't know where you were for the last 3 years but I've watched this closely every single day and have an idea or two about these events. If you have no idea how US and EU comes into play then there is nothing I can do for you. It's been written by respected AMERICAN academics how US/EU fucked up in this geopolitical play. I am sorry it's a mystery to you, go back to watching Spongebob. (Oh, go figure, 5 day old account trolling on wordnews Ukrainian events, color me shocked).  See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreement_on_settlement_of_political_crisis_in_Ukraine).  The agreement was signed by Yanukovich, the opposition, Foreign Minister of Germany Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Foreign minister of Poland Sikorski and head of the Department for continental Europe of the Ministry of foreign Affairs of the French Republic Eric Fournier. And do you know what happened when on the next night opposition seized government quarter? The same European foreign ministers, who urged to peacefully resolve the political crisis, cheered new Ukrainian government and totally forgot about  the agreement.  Yeah, referring freaks like Vasilieva who in her reports kills football teams, students and characters from books - makes your source strong. Its really a difference without a distinction. Where does Russia end? Where do the separatists begin? Where does your money begin? Where does mine end? The difference you are looking for is irrelevant. The separitists have power? Russia has power? The source of the power doesn't change for Ukraine. >After Russia sends in theirs.   Don't see any: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1XA2dYhQKA [removed] Buddy if you imagine this conflict, well, any modern day conflict, as black and white you have more certainly bought into propoganda from one side or another.

This is what I said, and this is exactly what the invasion was. Throw in some Russians living in Ukraine and that's it in its entirety. A Russian living in Ukraine is still a Russian. Nice rant, but the facts are as clear as daylight. The USA played no part in maiden. The president of Ukraine fled the country on his own will, basically given up any and all power that he had. No one forced him to do that, except maybe Putin.   Hell, we won't even send Ukraine weapons but we will send them to the Kurds and SDF. That should tell you a ton.  Right, the EU brokered a deal for the president to revert the constitution back and hold elections to placate the protesters.   Instead the president fled the country, which led to the protesters storming the government buildings. If he never left, there would have just been another election.  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31747754  There's a lot written about this. That was just the first link I grabbed. It clear the Russia is active in Ukraine. Because of Crimea the counter argument has little credibility.  That's just more glaringly obvious water-muddying and I'm frankly ashamed of you for embarassing yourself with it. Russia ends at it's established borders. Discussion ends. That's because you're being dishonest with yourself. Which is fine, you're only hurting yourself. [removed] Because you're stupid. You do realize that up to 1991 Russia and Ukraine shared a military, and up to 2014 actually shared pretty much all military equipment with exchange deals? The Ukranians are the bulk of the forces fighting the government. ethnic Russians are still Ukranians if they live their there whole life Downvoting doesn't change facts.  If that was the case this situation wouldn't exist would it? But hey according to you Russia has no part in Eastern Ukraine. Because Russia ends at its borders. Certainly not crossing them. Show me where I lie to myself. [removed] But that's not true. There is plenty of equipment that Russia has developed and never sold to Ukraine. Or given to them.  no, Russians living in Ukraine are not Ukrainian. Just like Americans living in Germany are not German. Just like South Africans living in the United States are not American. I've met Russians from Ukraine and there is nothing Ukrainian about them. In fact, that scoff at Ukrainian tradition. They prefer to be called Russian. Even the United States hasn't tried that one, and they've done just about every kind of invasion and takeover under the sun.

First of all - we don't have such resources.    ""we invested of 5 billions dollars to assist Ukraine..."" and bla bla bla. And it just fucking Ukraine.  We can do that shit even if we want to.  Also, unlike what media... I'm a bot working hard to help Redditors find related videos to watch. I'll keep this updated as long as I can. *** [Play All](http://subtletv.com/_r5rajnd?feature=playlist&ftrlnk=1) | [Info](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubtleTV/wiki/mentioned_videos) | Get me on [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mentioned-videos-for-redd/fiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf) / [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mentioned-videos-for-reddit) According to the Rosbalt information agency arrest of the FSB officers is connected to the arrest of the Anikeev (aka Lewis) who was one of the leaders of the group known as Sholtai-boltai (this is Russian for Humpty-dumpty). Guess nicks of others members of the group.  So, long story short, Anikeev started from the hacking of e-mails of businessmen and local officials in Saint-Petersburg. For not leaking this information businessmen and officials pay money to him. Later Anikeev moved to Moscow and started to hack e-mails there, mostly government clerks and officials. As it was written in the Rosbalt article hacking was performed using special equipment. Anikeev and (later) members of his team made false Wi-Fi nets near the places where clerks from government and president administration like to spend their time (some specific restaurants and cafes). Also he made business by hacking information of different important persons and selling it to the interested party. After all he collected a lot of information from e-mails of the businessmen and officials and the idea to make a site with this information published came to his mind. This site was sort of the information stock exchange. Also some information transferred to the Sholtai-boltai group from those who wanted this information to be exposed and that this information looked as hacked not as leaked. Some information Sholtai-boltai sold for the bitcoins, some for the real money. Also in the Rosbalt article a lot more information about work specifics of this group, but I drop it. So, as Rosbalt stated after the investigation Lewis personality was indetified and after the operation Anikeev was arrested. After he gave information to the FSB they arrested Michailov and so on.  Kommersantreported that AndreiGerasimov, head of the FSBs Information Security Center since 20009, would be dismissed.... So this is future crime? They werent working for CIA. They published online correspondance of russian officials who were responsible for some shady deals. For that they are charged for threason Cleansing of the house, Emperor is taking care of all the traitors that were plotting against him. The CIA is a rogue agency. They have no real oversight or accountability. They are not to be trusted. Double for the FSB. Does this confirm the golden shower dossier? More fake news.  The Moscow Times is a free publication that advertises hookers on its back page.   Of course, since this supports Hillaryland's favorite fairy tale, ""Trump and the Golden Showers"", I am sure this story will be spread far and wide here on reddit.  Its crazy how Hillaryland accepts the ""Trump is a secret agent"" story despite the fact its been debunked and has no evidence supporting it, but they cant accept Hillary and her cronies are as corrupt as can be, even though its proven in the wikileaks emails.  I thought Trump had a lot of delusional supporters, but they don't hold a candle to the nuttery that people are willing to believe in Hillaryland.  Unleash the ad hominems! does it matter though? Trump will choose for himself what the facts actually are. I wonder how many spies tRump will give up to the Russians. He will betray every person who has ever aided American. Anyone else find that KGB sounds so much better than FSB.   KGB, CIA, MI6. All classics. Why did they go and change the name? That's exactly why CIA did not want to release evidence. Knowing what was leaked allows to narrow scope and focus counter-intelligence to bust spies.   Trump got 19.5% of Rosneft, the Russians should expect to get a few extras.  The spies were arrested in December. Was Obama a Russian agent too? To all the butthurt Russians in this thread:  Do yourself a favor and overthrow that tyrant Putin so you can become a 1st world nation and not just a bunch of serfs slaving away for a cabal of plutocrats. Except they were arrested while Obama was still president. It's very constractive to call every russian who disagree with you about Russia - bot. Clearly you know more about my contry than i am.  Also, you don't even make sense. Russian, like me, support Trump only because he said he want to repair our relationship, we realy don't give a shit about anything else in his programm. Especialy in light of his opponent wat talking about basicaly starting said war.  We are the one don't wanting a war here.   Lol. It was being downvoted because it reads like it was written by a 12 year old, contains zero facts or substance and just generally idiotic.   But no, it's the Russians who are after you. This fucking place sometimes.  Yeah they really are a ""special"" bunch. A state run by a mafia godfather is stronk.  lmao 8 more years of this I'm downvoting you because you're speaking like a child.  I share your concern about the Trump administration's ties with the Kremlin and am highly suspicious about the timing of this CI coup.  But please try to use your big boy words. You are choosing a book for reading You really are that delusional, aren't you?  Literally everything you believed has turned out wrong but you are just doubling down on the retard button. So many butt hurt Russians, good lord. Yea, it could only be russians downvoting your /r/conspiary nonsense. Downvoted for acting like you made some really courageous comment in the face of overwhelming odds. This is fucking rich, you people are going nuts. Take something to reduce cortisol, you're going to blow a gasket.  > you fucking enemies of humankind. You sick fucks really want WW3, don't you?)   lol this isn't Middle-earth. Settle down, drama queen Who would have been the better candidate? no, they dont want, thats why people voted for trump, and not hillary I can't tell if you're joking or actually believe this You're missing the subject. Folks are pointing out that the FSB has suddenly become far more effective at spotting our spies in the wake of Trump's inauguration. It is built on the conspiracy theory that Trump is working in concert with the Russian government. The notion is that Trump is somehow orchestrating an information flow to Russia, letting him know who our spies are over there.   Edit: I didn't say I agree with this. I was just explaining the conspiracy theory because the gentleman i'm responding to either hasn't heard of the theory before or was confused as to how it applied to this news item. Is someone criticizing Russia acting here? I only see people connecting it trump.    You looking for something to be mad at?  It seems probable that they got caught after Obama publicly ordered the CIA to ask their assets over Russian hacking into the DNC. It is a perfect opportunity for their counter intelligence to lay a trap as they have prior knowledge of our assets being activated.  Remember the stuff they needlessly declassified like Russian cheering Trump's victory? That is a counter intel gold mine. When it's ten thousand things correlating it probably *does* imply causation. Correlation is evidence of causation, which is the part people who failed stats always forget.  You know when he said the NSA can share data with all other agencies.. yeah that's called open sourcing. Why delete it when everyone can have it. :D > hope Obama ordered a purge of sensitive information  Wouldn't that be treason, I mean, purposefully hamstringing the next administration? You are so fucking ridiculous. >  I hope Obama ordered a purge of sensitive information like this before Trump gets his hands on it  That would be treason and Obama would be hanging by now. lol some people are pretty mad. wonder why  Lol, no it doesn't. A fake news org reported this nonsense story and the Hillbots lapped it up. Since hillary bots were paid to sabotage the internet. Yep.   Do you think the death camps start this year or next year? Trump's general behavior towards Putin and absolute, his reaction to the dirty dossier, that he calls Russia ""equals"" (Trump calls nobody equals), the unexplained murder of a Russian source, the Russian hacking, the claim that NATO is obsolete *and* this news confirms it. L.O.L. Bringing up ad hominems when your whole comment is one logical fallacy after another. I tell you what... Instead of making fun of you for it (The National Enquirer is tabloid crap, but broke the John Edwards cheating scandal... What's your point in ragging the moscow times?), how about you link us some of those ""dubunked"" facts. We'll wait. In the meantime, I'll just keep watching point after point in the ""Piss Publication"" from another ""rag"" called buzzfeed being proven.   On a completely different note, as a user above posted, ""Do yourself a favor and overthrow that tyrant Putin so you can become a 1st world nation and not just a bunch of serfs slaving away for a cabal of plutocrats."" You russian trolls are terrible at playing American. Redditor for a year, mod of DNCleaks, and nothing but political shitposting? Sounds about right. would you like to buy some aluminum foil? Yeah like those nukes Saddam stashed in his backyard. This pile of shit excuse keeps getting parroted and people just continue to lap it up. No one should trust a single word the CIA says without corroborating evidence.  No, Trump and friends only got the brokerage fee.  Well actually, it appears from documents Qatar got ~9% of that. The other ~9% going to the Caribbean bank probably owned by Exxon/Americans-involved-with-Russia. .5% is commission for the broker.  So the fascistic deals going on in the world involve: Russia + alt-reich orange man + Qatar.  Might explain why many of Qatar's allies did not get the immigration ban. (just remember that in the gulf, Iran + Qatar + Saudi are as extreme ideologies as it gets compared to their neighbors).   Now all that money Russia spent on propaganda & all that work Exxon and others did for the Arctic Oil Deal and Rosneft gift... it will all be for nothing if US doesn't lift sanctions on Russia and doesn't drill the Arctic oils. Even their stock prices will plummet if the sanctions are not lifted. If orange man can't deliver... there will be some interesting viral videos to say the least. I hope you used American-made tinfoil for your hat.  The Russian foil actually ENHANCES your brainwaves and let Putij read your thoughts personally. Trump was given security briefings in December  Ukraine being attacked and our spies being captured after Treasonous Donnie got intel briefings. Nice work. I do not think this has anything to do with what orange man did.   I think it has to do with December expelling of Russian spies by Obama & burning of their names onto the Treasury website.  Their spies were burned:  https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/OFAC-Enforcement/Pages/20161229.aspx Fuckin' A.  I never understood the Russian craving for tyranny.  They have everything they need to be prosperous and free, and yet they choose to be slaves.  I just don't get it. > Do yourself a favor and overthrow that tyrant Putin so you can become a 1st world nation and not just a bunch of serfs slaving away for a cabal of plutocrats.  For many Russians the days of 1990s under Yeltsin is very much fresh and the vast majority do not want to go back to the bad old days where life expectancy fell off the edge of the cliff, the economy imploded, rampant corruption, state assets sold for a song then add insult to injury you had the election system rigged by consultants from America to ensure that any viable opposition didn't have a dog balls chance in hell of ever winning. I'm not a Russian (I'm from New Zealand) but when you consider what occurred post Soviet collapse and how America dealt with it - you can see why many Russians are not chummy with the US. Thanks for the idea, but this is very unlikely to happen. Being Russian myself, I certainly would like to see Putin gone, but I don't want to end up in prison, tortured, or dead, and I am sure my wife wouldn't like it either.  Another reason this won't happen is because the majority of Russians really do love him (yes, pathetic but true) and are pretty content with their life. Putin did bring some stability to the country after all, even though the common folk had to sacrifice their freedom for that. And don't forget that most Russians have never been abroad, and they have no idea how shitty Russia really is compared to the developed world. I was fortunate enough to spend several years of my life in Japan and can see how Russia is going downhill, but there is nothing that can be done about it now.  EDIT: spelling What if we don't consider Putin - tyrant and ourself slaves?  Some of us, like me, even watch you media about it, just don't realy see any reason to trust it? The fact that you use archaic terms like ""1st world"" tells me your knowledge on geopolitics could use some improvement. You're asking people to overthrow and elected government because you, a non-Russian, doesn't like him? Isn't that a bit arrogant? Ok, Mr. Smart Guy, let's pretend Putin is gone. Who do you replace him with? You realize that Russia endured far more terrible things than him, he is far from the worst. Many think that the devil you know is better. And I'm not even being an apologist, it's the reality of the situation. Over time, he made himself irreplaceable, or at least he can't be replaced without causing a lot of damage or a lot of risk. He played his hand almost flawlessly, furthering his own interests over those of Russia. He founded his personal national guard last year that is authorised to shoot at crowds, of course, you will never be the one to get shot at the barricades, easy for you to preach. And this won't even be enough, there are hundreds of other powerful oligarchs that will keep plundering the country.       It's not hard to incite people to action, but think a few steps ahead please. It's one of the things I never got about Maidan, which made Ukraine FUBAR, among other things. People got mad, blew up a few cars, burned a couple of buildings, mister Golden Loaf pissed his pants and ran, mister Candy Man was elected. Democracy and freedom won, right? No, he is just as shitty as the last one. Maybe before wrecking shit you think about what could happen to the country next, and whether or not that is worth it.       So, yeah, maybe we could just dial that Soros fella, he could come up with some suggestions. But now when I think about it, that's not a very good idea after all, he is all kinds of sleazy.    As you can see, the situation is quite shitty and hopeless.  What a massive level of naivety. You think Putin is the problem? You know nothing. No thanks, we're pretty happy as it is and Putin has been a great leader for us so far. I voted for him last election and if he keeps going the way he has been, I'll vote for him again in the next one. One more thing - and I'm gonna indulge you here - just wait for around 15 years, and the odds are pretty good that he will be gone, if natural causes or power struggle don't claim him first. Our former minister of economic development recently gave Russian economy around 15 years to diversify until it becomes so bad that it will tear the country asunder. Of course, we won't be able to do that because we couldn't do that during 14 years of prosperity, and our higher ups will keep solemnly maintaining the ""this is fine"" attitude, just like they always do. And then people will be pissed enough to go apeshit.    ""Something something river something something bodies of your enemies"" -  a piece of ancient Chinese wisdom.  Do you really think working for your American corporate overlords is any better? Would be nice if the Americans could do the world a favor and not vote in an idiot for a second third time.   Oh wait... Yeah because your amazing democracy is working well in US. > Do yourself a favor and overthrow that tyrant $TYRANT so you can become a 1st world nation and not just a bunch of serfs slaving away for a cabal of plutocrats.  We may see this very comment reflected back at the US in a couple years ...  And then yet another to overthrow that guy who came after Putin. So no. Enough is enough. Another revolution is the lastest thing that Russia need. I see Russia as the biggest threat to world peace and prosperity, and Trump as his useful idiot or (most likely) actual puppet.  However, this doesn't mean we should begin talking like the guys at r/The_Donald or Russian trolls invading news sites. Let's keep our focus on rational arguments and then when we *do* need to show our disgust for our opponents complete lack of conscience and coherent thought, we can do a [proper insult](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRKz82v5JQY). Haha, this thread is hilarious. All kind of clueless people here, from russian guys thinking that putin is some kind of a god to some guy that believes that us created everything there is. So many freaks in one place. I don't buy that Trump's team sold them out yet but Trump and his team began getting limited intelligent briefing before the election and after the election, they began to get the full intelligent briefing that Obama also received.  Anything Obama knew, they would've known.  So it's possible that Trump team passed on information they received, and from that the Russian narrowed down to a short list of people knew the info and could've passed it to the CIA.  Another possibility is the dossier was known to the press as far back and June of last year and by September-October, many press organization had a copy of it.  If the many press organizations manage to get a hold of it, i'm sure the FSB could get a copy too.  From there, they probably figured out who wrote it and round up every one who had contact with the author while he was in Russia investigating. You know, I was going to make a snarky comment, while agreeing with you, but I can't. I can't take this topic seriously. People honestly fall for what really is a conspiracy theory that's so out there it's fucking hilarious. It is most likely a case of Russian counter intelligence using the very public inquiry into ""Russian hacking"" to find dormant moles.  I want to repair the relationship too, as soon as you get the fuck rid of that fascist piece of shit Putin from power. Honestly you just sound like a useful idiot more than anything. Now be careful. Just because Putin has a 140% approval rating doesn't mean that voting is a sham. In fact, 140% of people think it's not a sham!!  I kind of prefer that to countries run by puppets beholden to business interests... too much death and destruction for my liking, people live or people die, they still make money.  Don't worry president for life Trump will make sure no illegals ever vote again! There will not be 8 years, you strange person you.  This fucknuts will destroy the world if he has half a chance. Not only - also very stupid rednecks who believe anything Russian trolls tell them and call established facts ""conspiracy theory."" How courageous of you. Literally anyone who is not clinically insane and in hoc to America's enemies. As much as I don't like your comment, you probably would've been a better option. Me. That guy sitting beside me on the bus. Pretty much everyone I saw today. Look at the vote tally, genius.  People voted for Clinton by millions.  America chose her, then a few hundred people vetoed the election. They were arrested before the inauguration, so I guess Obama sold hem out. And FSB has always been very effective at spotting your spies. No, I'm not missing the point.  It seems like your only point is that you're angry and wanting to lash out even if it doesn't make sense. Seems like you're so mad you can't put together a coherent sentence.  The only thing I'm upset about is that both the republicans and democrats have lost their minds at this point, and there's no one left to represent level headed people. How can you tell a bald-faced lie like that!!!!???  >Sergei Mikhailov, allegedly detained at a board meeting last December, and his deputy, Dmitry Dokuchaev, were **arrested by the Kremlin on Jan. 27 for treason and illegal hacking.** Wow I'm surprised the CIA even has any agents left. If only that correlation actually existed and wasn't created because of some peoples pre-conceived notions on Trump. Now if Trump was actually working for Putin, then maybe this conspiracy could have legitimacy. A persons straw man dose not create correlation.   Also your right on that it would be evidence (alone) if a credible correlation existed, and I'm not trying to jump around. I was wrong in making that statement, because now I see it doesn't give off the argument was trying to make.    Is hamstringing the next administrations ability to commit treason treason? This story is being run everywhere. Its verified  What death camps?  You probably mean Happy Reeducation and Relaxation Camps. Calling buzzfeed a rag is an insult to rags. Yet another fake news victim.  I thought the 9/11 truthers were gullible.  Do you know how to use the website google?    Also L.O.L. at the idea that everyone who doesnt ignore reality and blindly support Hillary is a Russian serf.  Thank god these Hillary people have been kept out of power.  That's all I can say.   Right, America is the shining light on the hill. Now with this asshole Resident the hill is the landfill.  Which the GOP was more than willing to spread and defend.  Let's see some evidence that we shouldn't trust them. Yeah! Never trust experts, they're elitist!   /s Seriously though, can you not see the logic there? Why is it a ""pile of shit""? Why else is Russia cleaning house?   Your pro Trump? Thats great for you but the circumstantial evidence is really starting to strengthen beyond speculation. Pleople have been convicted of murder with less circumstantial evidence  Since when does the right care about evidence These men died in Dec, Buzfeed released the dossier in mid Jan ""only"" Never gonna ban the gulf states, they might support bad people, but they do it the right way. Have a read of Secret Affairs by Mark Curtis; the UK gives nearly as much support to radical Islam as any of the gulf states.   It's not the West vs Islam, it's the West vs Russia/China using Islam as required. oh boy we are calling them facists now whats next? calling the white house reichstag?  also the deal was signed back in [2012](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-exxon-rosneft-idUSBRE83H0UE20120418)NOT now..... Aluminum Foil. You're so naive you can't even insult someone without sounding stupid. At least you're ""NotSelfReferential"", just ""NotSelfIntelligent"" Why you try distracting from the actual topic? Earlier, actually, despite his initial lack of interest in attending/reading them. Is that what your almighty media told you? How do you know Ukraine didn't instigate the latest fighting in order to give Trump a reason not to lift the sanctions or at least put a bit of pressure on him? This anti-Russia paranoia is disturbing. You may be confusing diplomats with spies.  Fun fact: Russia was the last European country to maintain the institution of serfdom (which is just a hair more free than slavery).  While serfdom died out in western europe by the 1300's - Russia did not end the practice till the 1860's, and we are talking about a MAJORITY of Russians being virtual slaves up to that time.  I think that probably contributes a lot to the toxic blend of nihilism and a certain feeling of 'worthlessness' on the part of the average Russian psyche. They basically feel that human beings are animals and the only way to keep order is via a 'strong hand'. Because it's not a tyranny despite you calling it like that and under Putin Russia has enjoyed the most prosperous period of economic growth and political stability for long time.  Putin did a great job till now, Russians remember well the 90s and are going to avoid that situation like a plague.  It also does not help that Russia's opposition lacks any realistic and normal people to vote. The two biggest ""normal"" parties fused in Russia leaving in the opposition mostly lunatics. do they? no, they are just pushed into it by countries like us Not tyranny. Just some kind of order. When you know that you'll be paid for your work in time and won't be killed by some random guys near your home. Sadly that experiment with democracy utterly failed. That's a great response, thank you.  All I can say is things were just as shitty or worse at one point in human history - for hundreds of years nobody had any civil rights whatsoever.  But somehow or another, things slowly changed and got better. Part of this is probably because despite their insane 'privilege' - elites themselves lived horrible lives in constant fear of each other and their 'peasants'. What are castles but prison structures designed to keep people OUT instead of IN? For hundreds of years a noble could not take a walk outside their prison yards without fear of their lives. Today in some places like Mexico, even middle class people cannot drive around outside of walled compounds without fear of being kidnapped for ransom.   Which is to say, no matter how hopeless things may seem - they CAN get better. History proves this.  >What if we don't consider Putin - tyrant and ourself slaves?  I'm sure in an earlier time a lot of Russian serfs loved their masters and didn't feel themselves 'oppressed'. The best kind of slavery is the mental kind. There are none so hopelessly enslaved than those who believe they are free. Isn't it arrogant for Russians masquerading as Americans to come into US forums trying to sway the election to Trump and now propping him up?  If Russians feel entitled to do that, I feel equally entitled to inform them that they are advocating against their own best self interests (which I genuinely believe, BTW), and can DO A LOT BETTER then that POS Putin and his cabal of gangsters. > furthering his own interests over those of Russia.  Come on now, you can do better. We can ALL do better. Im fucking sick and tired of this bullshit of trying to justify Putin with lack of better alternative.  Thanks for painting Russia as a place where no one is better and would do better than him. /s  If he's really the best Russia could come out with, than burn this country to the ground and me with it, as there's really nothing worth of existence here at all.  The Koch Bros. have a lot more money than Soros, so I'm not sure why you chose him to take a swipe at the US. > Many think that the devil you know is better.  Why does it have to be a devil?  >Over time, he made himself irreplaceable  Indeed  > As you can see, the situation is quite shitty and hopeless.  Agreed  On a side note, I work with a few Russians. They support Putin. Want to know the funny thing? They don't even live in Russia.   The hypocrisy.   He has been in power for so long and still can't get the wages and conditions straight in there.   Don't understand why they won't try and beat China and US at their own game. They have the people and the technology to do so. Your hopelessness and fatalism is so genuinely Russian, it breaks my heart. And so long as it's widely believed and felt, it will be true.  >Who do you replace him with?  Someone who's not an ex-KGB murderer?  Like, are you serious? You think no one more worthy of leadership has come out of Russia than *Putin?* How brainwashed are you? > Who do you replace him with?   fucking. Gorbachev.   seriously > Who do you replace him with?  Any of you, I would think. Even the cook. OK - tell me then - what IS the problem? You cool with all those dead journalist? Are you proud he's become the richest man in the world through corruption? happy with a carrot Russia is the country of Pushkin, Tolstoy, Gorky, Dostoyevsky, Chekhov, Stravinsky, Prokokiev and one of my favorite filmmakers Andrei Tarkovsky.  Do not sell yourselves short. You sure make Putin sound great. Just 15 years until your country falls apart under him. What a super great leader. I'm out there marching in the streets - and I know many Russians have done the same.  None of us should give up hope for a better country. They've been 1000% better for Romania than the Warsaw Pact was.   At least the Russians didn't invade us twice, like CZ.  As someone who works for a corporation and gets paid well enough to do the things I want to do with my life, hell yeah. I'm not pretending to hold up the US as a good example by any means, there are other better run countries like in Scandinavia.  Lets hope it doesn't come to that but it very well might. Russia can do better. What? Russians love Putin. Just because Americans hate him and get a shitload of propaganda about him doesn't mean the whole world thinks just like Americans. So self absorbed. > Most people in Russia WANT Putin out  We all must keep fighting for a more fair and democratic society. Do they? Do you have any data to suggest that to be the case?  >Most people in Russia WANT Putin out.  Where exactly are you getting that from? [This year he has an 83% approval rating](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/how-to-understand-putins-jaw-droppingly-high-approval-ratings/2016/03/05/17f5d8f2-d5ba-11e5-a65b-587e721fb231_story.html?utm_term=.78cee6714633), which is astronomical compared to the West.  I would say that they want Putin IN.  Wow, such ignorance. Whatever reasons Russians are participating in these forums, I think the fact they ARE here opens up an opportunity for some interesting conversations. Most Russians I have met are fairly intelligent people - as a lot of Russians receive pretty good educations. >  believes that us created everything there is.  Link to where I said or even implied this? So basicaly right now you want war. Just because media and politicians told you Putin is evil. But you still manage to blame us for wanting war, cause you know, we don't wan't to believe them more than our own eyes.   Only Americans are allowed to put fascists in power. I'm pretty sure he wants too, as soon as you get rid of the terrorist-supporting CIA, the corrupt media and the imperialist congress. yeah, and instead of putin you want in kremlin some pro-us puppet right?  Very strong argument.  thanks:) My english is very flawed.  Putin's approval rating is around 80%, and its measured by western/international groups like Gartner, Gallup etc.   You once decried the UN-monitored, vetted and approved Nicaraguan elections as a sham. When western agencies themselves reported Putin's sky-high approval rating, you started saying ""Rooskie media is state-run Kremlin-bot/shill/troll"". When Novaya Gazeta said ""We are sorry, Netherlands"" for MH17 and criticized Putin for Crimea, you were nowhere to be seen. Unlike Russia where the puppet masters have thrown out the puppet and installed themselves as supreme overlords. How glorious YAY!  Ask a question. Get down voted.   This is a common problem of the current times where everyone assumes things and goes off on their little perspective rants. Seems to be a case of agree or be an enemy, fighting fire with fire, etc etc. but hey I am sure everyone here is important and opinions matter. Maybe if the US wouldn't treat half of the world like enemies they wouldn't have half the world against them. > personally, all I have seen from the Trumpists and the Bannoners is ""lets fight a war with China, cos its great and very nice, lets look down on China, lets try to push them around and shit...""  China is rising, fast. Russia is stagnating at best. Seems obvious that China is a more pressing matter don't you think?  China doesn't have the nuclear arsenal to assure mutual destruction, unlike Russia. Now is our chance to act. Your timeline is a tad off:  https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/intelligence-chiefs-briefed-trump-and-obama-on-unconfirmed-claims-russia-has-compromising-information-on-president-elect/2017/01/10/9da3969e-d788-11e6-9a36-1d296534b31e_story.html?utm_term=.242c0215a82d Your angry your missing or missed the point...it made sense to me and three others Are you simple? Every sentence in my statement was coherent.    I'll dumb it down for you.   No one here is attacking Russia for handling their spies. They're connecting it to trump.    Was that simple enough?  Dudes account is 3 days old and entirely comprised of shit talking and defending Russia.  Very much so. Just pretending they will be treasonous is not grounds for committing treason.  Projecting your wet dream of fascism on Trump isn't helping anything. Unfortunately just because a story appears in the MSMBS doesn't make it verified. No, I mean the ones where all the Muslims and Californians will be killed in.  Operation Northwoods. Iraq :( The dossier was shopped to every media outlet since at least September. Russia knew about it long before September or they suck at intelligence.  Yeah. The 0.5 % is probably the brokerage fee, which amounts to at least 250 million. Not sure though, please correct me if necessary. Uh, we've been calling them fascists for a while now. But only because they are. Wrong deal.  Learn to read tinfoil tnfl/ *noun* - foil made of aluminium or a similar grey metal, used especially for covering or wrapping food.  In this case, ""tinfoil"" has become abstracted from the material itself and become a descriptor of the usage of the object; thus, as superior materials have come along, the name has stuck. Similar words are ""linoleum"" and ""tarmac"" (often used to describe polyvinyl chloride and asphalt concrete, respectively).  This hasn't just happened with materials - for example, ""cupboard"" originally referred to a sideboard upon which one would display their cups, plates, etc. Now any cup or plate storage area is called a ""cupboard"".  Basically, words aren't just their etymologies. You are getting too close to the truth.  Me and my shadowy brothers in the Russia cabal have been paid handsomely to distract the brsve Americans. You conspiracy theorists need to make up your mind: is Trump a russian plant or not?  If he were, wouldn't Putin be telling him to actually *attend* intelligence briefings so he can.... steal intelligence? Almighty media? Sorry, we don't get our news from the Brgerbrukeller. Honestly the fact that Russians went from basically slaves to competing with the united States during the Cold war is an amazing feat of nation building. > 1860's  USA lagged similarly with slavery And that is why Russia had like 3 revolutions in XX century only.  Look at the black folk who casually reffer to themselves as dirt even as youngsters, speaking of their women like shit. generational colonisation of the mind. > It also does not help that Russia's opposition lacks any realistic and normal people to vote.  Putin rounded them up and had them shoot themselves in the face a few times before kindly stowing themselves in the trunk of a car. Very constractive.  Okay, please explain to me, how i am a slave of Putin (or somebody else for that matter)?  There is not a lot thing easier than educated people to leave Russia. It's like any moment you want. But somehow there are still a lot of them around. Didn't bunch of idiots screamed in USA not a long time ago, they all would immigrate in Canada. Like it's just some sort of people like that, has nothing to do with reality. And who are the ones here, telling me i am a slave, while completly sure they are living in total freedom. Wich nation calls their president ""leader of the free world"" - god, i cringe so hard, everytime i hear that.  My ideas, my understanding being constantly chalenged by western media, by youtube, by reddit, by russian opposition media, by all this arguments in comment sections.  And you are living in this comfortable circle jerk. Unfortunately for you the Russians are the ones that get to decide who their leaders are, not you, and it's by design. Your ""permission"" or ""approval"" or ""acceptance"" for the candidates or people who run Russia is neither sought nor required. > Im fucking sick and tired of this bullshit of trying to justify Putin with lack of better alternative.  I mean, even the US had two shit choices this time around, maybe we should burn them down too. Let's just unload our nuclear arsenal on the world, fuck this gay Earth with its corrupt politicians.    But like I mentioned in another post, nobody would let a caring and honest man become the president. Some greedy and powerful oligarch seizing power is a far more realistic scenario. [Good video on why would that happen, in authoritarian countries you have to pay off your key supporters to stay in power, which makes you corrupt.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs) > than burn this country to the ground  Good luck with that one. Everyone that has tried pretty much failed and with their nukes I'd say it's pretty much suicidal to try. Russia will exist and doesn't need anyone's consent. Oh no, if there will be no Russia someone else will have to play her role. You see, every system gives birth to the antisystem. And Russia is this antisystem for western civilization. Not China, not India - Russia. Because China and India have their own different civilizations. If we consider religious analogue China and India are diferrent religions, that can be fought or ignored; but Russia is a heresy that can destroy the system from inside or give birth to the alternative system (like it already did with communism).      Russia was always a heresy of western civilization, so it must be always oppressed but never destroyed, otherwise it will pop up elsewhere. And life there must be propoganded to be as unattractive as possible.      See, simple. It's funny that you failed to name anyone who would be a good fit for this position. But keep throwing insults at me, that certainly makes your point stronger.  That is the guy who would definitely be lynched in a week, seeing how many people are nostalgic about USSR and salty about its breakdown. Hanging from a tree with a [pizza slice in his mouth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgm14D1jHUw). In other word, you wan't a puppet and a yes man. People don't belive in democracy at all and afraid of any changes. And they have all reasons in the world for that. your attitude and the people who share it. Our elites. They were milking country and people for 20 years without a stop and will continue to do so. Right now these elites are somewhat contained by Putin, but he did enough shit against them that his successor will be crushed. I don't want Yeltsin 2.0 with bastards running around with zero regard to national interests and without even concealing shady stuff.  This problem will never be solved with popular uprising against ""ruler"". Maidan demonstrated what will happen: change of oligarch clan. There were plenty in the 90s before Putin came to power and ended the criminal bullshit yeah. Since he came to power, I don't really know of any where the government could be involved. did putin kill them? no Have you seen our alternatives to Putin? Loaded question, of course, he is not the richest man personally. But in the sense that he has the entire resources of Russia at his disposal while President, you could say he controls the most in the world.  What he actually did was sacrifice everything for his country. He gave up any chance of ever retiring and moving to Miami or whatever to live out his days in the sun. He lost his marriage because work took away all his free time.  If he was thinking of himself, he would simply sell out Russia bit by bit to criminals and western governments and companies, like Yeltsin did before him. He would then take all the money received in kickbacks from the criminals and move to some western country where he could present lectures on ""freedom and democracy"". Speak for yourself, I drive a Lexus and own my own home. Solzhenitsyn, Gogol, Yesinin...... Yeah, he isn't. Where did I say he is?  Do they pay you enough to compensate for living in an oligarchy? There are plenty of people in Russia, also an oligarchy, who would laugh at your paycheck. Everyone I know who lives in Russia incidentally also gets paid enough to do things they want to do. My American  friends though... In Michigan... The superiority might be only in your mind. It's already better than it was 30 years ago. Any kind of revolution just make everything worse for a long time. Well I wan't talking about you but referring to comments chain to your comment. Though if you are that guy who said that soviet industrialisation is almost entirely US merit then you are indeed the guy I was talking about.  edit: checked it, that guys name is Seret so nope, not you I do not want war, and you damn well know that.  Your Glorious Leader is a nihilistic maniac.  We will defend ourselves, as any human beings would.  If he would attack us, then you need to depose him. The man kills dissenters and journalists without complaint. He is hardly a good man. Regardless of what media you are consuming.  Facts are facts.  > Just because media and politicians told you Putin is evil.  Are you saying there is an international media conspiracy to frame Putin?  What about what your own countrymen say, like Garry Kasparov?  Some one who has been involved in Russian activism and had to flee because of his beliefs?  Putin has rightfully earned the label as a weasel-faced dictator. We'll have freedom as soon as we get rid of our security, press, and elected government?  Very Russian thinking. Or just someone who, you know, isn't a dictator. I find it ironic that the trump security staff(and I would not be surprised if trump himself) are using their personal private email servers, much like another certain candidate.  Half the world isn't against us.  Just exactly the same sorts of rotten bastards who are against us internally.  The decent people of America and the decent people of everywhere else are one and the same, and have the same cause. China isn't taking anyone over. Why would you want to attack China? How dumb is that?  ""Oh, this country is doing well economically, let's blast them before they get too many nukes."" Really? Are you twelve years old? You know this isn't a zero-sum game, right? Love how they always vanish when proof arrives.  Perhaps you're angry you don't know the difference between your and you're...and maybe that's why you can't articulate. If that's your idea of coherent I feel sorry for anyone who has to deal with you on a daily basis. There's so many 'people' here with accounts from a week to a couple months old, posting pro-Russia stuff on Russia-related posts. It's nuts.  That's interesting. Preventing treason is treasonous. Don't be silly we're not barbarians we'll simply put them in compounds surrounded by fencing and barbed wire for ""their own safety"". California in particular has had some practice rounding people up. The do some covert shit they can't tell citizens about, but when have they lied to our government? No.   Read up on it - the CIA came up with zero evidence initially and stuck with the facts until the Bush administration pressured them into picking and twisting bits that fit the story they wanted. Sorry I was being sarcastic, but I guess it didn't translate well over the internet.  Your number is pretty accurate, and it is an insanely large amount of money. i really REALLY doubt you know the difference between a facist and a typical right wing leader.. its the only deal ros has listed on their website unless ofc you claim they are keeping them in secret now.. Ah, you are in one of the St Petersburg ""troll factories"" then?  Trump is also a subject to his personality. I doubt he can handle too many meetings with obvious proof of Russian activities and threats while just listening. Luckily, for him, he doesn't have to. He can just hand the reports over instead. He's a Russian puppet, not a plant.  The degree of influence or improper relationship with Russia can be very problematic without him literally taking orders directly from Putin.  It's called sarcasm, look it up, it's under ""s"". Edit: Apparently Russian trolls don't like to hear anything that tarnishes the glorious legacy of the USSR   Fun fact - The success of soviet industrialism was almost entirely due to the effort to bring in American experts and technology. This was, in fact, Stalin's entire strategy.  Several major US companies including General Electric, Ford, and the major architecture firm (of Albert Kahn) who designed Ford's giant factories. They electrified the soviet union and build ALL of the major factories there, where they produced near exact copies of US tractors, automobiles,  tanks, etc.  The Russians didnt have the expertise to build a single one of these factories, let alone mass-produce a working engine, by themselves. Even after a lot of training, they lacked the organization skills to complete large scale industrial projects and had to call Americans to supervise at every level and train their people. It took YEARS until they got to a point where they were somewhat self sufficient. And then... wait for it...  After building it all up, which required selling off the grain his starving people worked to produce, Stalin ended the contracts and ordered the murder of the people he tasked with bringing in foreign talent, anyone who was trained overseas by foreigners, and so forth. He killed his own experts, even the ones who had key project management experience, all to control the soviet ideology of the time. He sent their wives to labor camps. He put soviet party heads in charge of the historical effort to document the industrialization of the Soviet Union and then quietly killed the whole project, and pushed the propaganda that it was all done by the great soviet people. Soviet history is a fucking wild ride.   Fantastic article.  Talks about the American Prussian Jewish Architect and the Russian Jewish negotiator who made this all possible. The Russian guy was  murdered, and the American was given shit for helping the commies, even though in doing so he allowed them to fend off the Nazis, which saved our ass later on.  https://www.jstor.org/stable/41933723  Well, you can credit all that to the Communists - but unfortunately they ended up turning on their own people, with Stalin just massacring incredible amounts of people.  AND by turning on their own people, in a way the communists just ended up REAFFIRMING the latent serf's love/hate relationship with their masters. They never stopped being slaves. Every big infrastructure or industry project under Stalin had its own mass grave. No different than serfdom. They worked like animals and lived in deplorable conditions. It was just a switch from working the fields to working the factories. And as far as accomplishments. The Russians really like to make it look like they're as good as others. But under the surface, it's apathy and vodka. Sorry, I have read up on this as I was also interested. The development of Russian further education started around the 1870s when it was recognised that they needed a lot of educated people in order to transform the economy. The process continued until communism when it was sped up in the 20s under Lenin and Stalin. Sure they took western tech where they could but they needed the educated workforce. but did USA with serfdom exist in 1300? They need to have another one and get rid of Putin.  Instead of trying to drag everyone down to their level, they should fight to rise above the kind of society they have now. > Look at the black folk who casually reffer to themselves as dirt  Link?  Have you ever actually met a black American? Well - go ahead right now and reply to this post by saying some extremely critical things about him - even if you don't actually believe them personally - do your best and just unload on him.... [removed] So you dictate what reality is? [A quick search about Russians brain drain will tell you that I'm correct.] (https://www.stratfor.com/image/brain-drain-sapping-russia-its-talent)   Its just beyond my understanding how someone can not believe that during a time of crisis the ones which posess marketable skills will leave the country to seek a better life. My country in particular has profited a lot from brain drains. (Switzerland) > Unfortunately for you the Russians are the ones that get to decide who their leaders are, not you.  But Russians ARE making a choice to come to US based websites like this one and offer THEIR opinions, sometimes about OUR politics.  All I am doing is using this as an opportunity to discuss what's going on in Russia from MY perspective, just as I engage with my fellow Americans about US politics. Of course I cannot 'decide' who Russian leaders are - I can't make my fellow Americans vote for who I want them to either for that matter.   But you act as if its some sort of 'audacity' on my part to even dare to have an opinion.  If you don't want to hear these things, why even come onto a US based website in the first place? He's just offering an opinion.  We're allowed to do that.  Fuck off. > fuck this gay Earth  lol wut? I think you didn't get my point.   Nobody is justifying or trying to paint Hilary or Trump as good, due the lack of better choices.   > Some greedy and powerful oligarch seizing power is a far more realistic scenario.  True, but at least he would be called for what he would be seen for what he is. Now with Putin, the difference between the Oligarchs and his cronies in the government is only in the name, as both are just a bunch of kleptocracy.   Putin toke away from the Oligarchs to give to the government, right? However, he brought his cronies to the government and they have full control and basically own all wealth and assets. The only difference is that Oligarchs have the wealth directly under their possession, while his cronies are just in control of it and will lose it if they stop supporting Putin.   So basically Putin is the ultimate Oligarch.   Now tell me how an obvious oligarch is any different or any worst than Putin?   I didn't mean it literally, but whatever! So you're saying there's literally no one better than your ex-KGB murderer turned dictator? Almost anyone would be better (assuming they weren't immediately murdered, of course), but specifically, why not start with Zyuganov?  he's got the experience, and was probably privy to things that the post-Soviet government might not know show me on the doll where Mr. Gorbachev touched you But if you look around at the rest of the world (which was not possible when Communists were in power) - you can see that democracy works very well for many countries. My 'attitude' being what exactly? > Right now these elites are somewhat contained by Putin  AFAIK he is part of them - have heard that right now he is one of the richest men in the world.  But your fear of the chaos that would take place if Putin was no longer in office is interesting as it reminds me of how the insane Ivan IV retained power in Russia because infighting of Boyars was so bad he as thought as the only alternative to retaining any semblance of order.  Ultimately - this is no kind of 'life'. Look at the world and see that other countries (and I'm not even talking about the US here)  are able to exist with a far more civil society and realize we are all human beings and CAN attain what other people do if we can just figure out the right path. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_journalists_killed_in_Russia#Under_Putin_.28incl._2nd_Chechen_conflict.29  The most infamous being https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Alexander_Litvinenko Death by polonium? If our leaders killed off all the opposition or had them jailed, we wouldn't go ""oh, seems like he's the most moderate left"". [Here's Putin's vacation home.](https://imgur.com/2dtEHYf)  [Here's his boat. ](https://imgur.com/fQo0ibE)  Quite a sacrifice your impeccable dear leader made. If I come rob your house will you kiss my ass too? yeah... here on reddit you can have and be whatever you want.   Truth is people are kept in the edge of poverty with a pseudo social state. If they start revolting this way they are easier to manipulate by pressing them into struggle.   Yay, long live Russia. >Ok, Mr. Smart Guy, let's pretend Putin is gone. Who do you replace him with?  Right there, by implication. You're telling me there's literally no one better than your ex-KGB murderer turned dictator? Or are you just *that* used to other people telling you what to do that you need me to do so as well? Grow a pair. Russia is a 2nd world nation - you can do better. Then what make you think we want too? Do you realy see russian as some warmongering horde, you brainwashed idiot?   Our president (nothing more, you make him some kinda allpowerfull godlike figure, for us hi is just who hi is) is who the fuck care who he is.  We judge him by decisions and changes in our lifes. Sorry we don't use CNN and BBC as final factor in our opinions - they shown to many times who full of shit they are.  And so far - nothing in his actions make me believe hi wants war with anybody.   Who you mean by ""We""? If NATO, you are realy braindead. We stand no chance against NATO in none nuclear war and we know that, also we have nothing to gain in war with them. This is just so stupid.  Except blaming him for every death of everybody from opposition - is not facts, just speculations.  There a lot of them and some are involved in any kinda of shady shit. And that don't make any sense, cause there are thothands of others, there are papers, radio, tv channels, killing some dude accomplish nothing, except for giving west chance to blame him for it. Realy, the version about them being killed by CIA to blame Putin looks much more reasonable (while also not being close to fact at all)   I wouldn't say conspiracy. You mainstream media just owned by that same people, who own you politicians, and they all pushing pretty much the same agenda. Making an exmaple of opposing politician or activist is very smart. As far as i can see - half of USA screamed about Trump being  ""literaly hitler"", another half pretty much the same about Hillary. Should i just trust one of them?   As far a people like Kasparov -main reason they flee west is nobody give the shit about them here, and there tha are heroic fighthers for  freedom.  how is he dictator? tell me because he is not us puppet? just like gaddafi, saddam and others? when they refused to be puppet, they were suddenly murderous dictators thank you:) Wtf! No!? The irony! I try to stay up to date, but shits moving too fast. Is this real? Well the decent people are surely not the majority that voted in the past three decades, leave alone the strategic allies of the US.  And while half the world was an euphemism Russia, China, various ME countries, and more easily add up to 2 maybe three billion people that are against or in a state against the US. > The decent people of America and the decent people of everywhere else are one and the same, and have the same cause.  Tell that to the decent people of Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Syria, Vietnam...   But those weren't deemed decent by the US, so they are fair game.  I am making the same argument MacArthur made in 1950. It's hardly original. Keyser Soze Lmao wow.....go somewhere  I knew i was seeing history being made when julian assange had his ama and seen all those russian shills, then a weird outage after...   Then after that i notice the donald spreading bullshit about john mccain teying to make him seem like a war criminal and all those posters were only about pro russia pro syria ... Then conspiracy got take over by russians complete  Ly the same day as that julian assange ama So is revolution.  Got a good source for that? I havent been able to find a quality source for that line of reasoning Lulz, if you're going to try to be an agent provocateur for Putin, at least use a different account that doesn't show a mile long comment history of you speaking in fluent Russian. Friendly tip: Be less obvious or it's off to Siberia for you, komrade!  Seriously, you suck at international destabilization. Stay the fuck out of our elections, Red Dawn. Holy Christ do you even know how to use the internet?  http://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN14O1XP [My mistake, comrade.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=javrU2r8_AU) (The *Marxist* comrade.) Whats to be ashamed of using the wests technology and expertise to develope? The country was 100 years behind Western Europe when Stalin was in charge. Of course they needed it. Its your attitude that has me downvoting you.  Ironically many of the murdered Americans who came to Russia were given absolutely zero help by the American government. The American embassador to Russia at the time was a huge sleezeball more concerned with bribes and stealing than he was over the lives of any American or Russian. Yep.   On top of that, the foundation of Soviet trucks was the quarter-million Studebakers we sent over, that they put their Katyushas on.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studebaker_US6 If you know any other recepie of turning 95% illiterate agrarian population, lagging half a century behind in technology, into a self-sufficient industrial superpower over the course of 20 years, please, enlighten us.      And don't forget that Soviet industrialisation by US wasn't selfless at all. It was your exit out of the Great Depression. And only ones who payed the price were poor russian peasants with their lives. You must be thankful, dear sir. Kulaks aren't people.   Oh. My. God.      That was an incredeble feat of compiling almost all liberal misconceptions and myths about Russia in a single post. Upvote! >Stalin just massacring incredible amounts of people.  Casually ignoring that it was Stalin that made the soviets a superpower building an actual industry No one is fooled. They want to be powerful but they never will be with Putin in charge. > but did USA with serfdom exist in 1300?  Excellent portrayal of ""whataboutism"".  And America was formed in 1776. I'm not even sure how to respond to the 1300 thing... Russia got serfdom in 1649. Before there were some peasants oppression, but cases of real serfdom/slavery weren't spread widely before late XVI century. And really close to the slavery it became only in XVIII century. Why would they? In 18 years Putin managed a lot and he still does. If I was a Russian there was no chance in hell I was not going to vote him because some guy in Pensacola says ""I lack freedom"". I would vote somebody else if they looked like a better opportunity and I was dissatisfied with current leadership. Putin has actual 80% support of his people. Part due to propaganda effort but russian gdp and influence has risen during his time. Trump on the other hand.. actually, during putin they prosper more than anytime in history What if we don't want to. Who are you to tell us who shoud govern our coutry?  Is democrasy means to you being a bitch of USA politicians and media - to what they say, believe what they say? I realy don't think that is a definition. Ridiculous thing to say. Hehehe. I'l do better. http://echo.msk.ru http://novayagazeta.ru https://tvrain.ru  This are 3 main oppositional resources in Russia. Radio, Paper and cabel channel.  They unload on Putin and goverment every fucking day, blaming them for all shit possible, pushing western countries agenda, promoting ukranian point of view and shit. While articles and shows try to be polite - there are hell in comment sections.  I read them and some other regulary just to challenge my point of view.   Also - i am disagree with goverment policy on many aspects and regulary express that, and actualy don't think Putin is deciding that much. Hi is more like a face of of some political powers, manager, nothing more.   The fact that you think critisizing Putin in Russia is somehow dangerous just show how fantasticaly brainwashed you are. You just how zero idea what you talkng about.   JUST DO IT I read/comment mostly on news somehow concerning Russia, i think that is only logical since i am, you know, russian. Also it's US politician-media drug Russia in you election-post election information bum.  Also - this US election became big news even in Russia, most others news here are not realy intersting for me.  Do you consider that my post history looks the same with other russian, cause you know, same reasons.  Let's take 2 different statements, pretend that they are the same, proof one and pretend that we just proofed both.  And this is how bullshit arguments being done.  You have a right to an opinion, no doubt about that, and I'm sure the Russians that come here are grateful, no doubt. It doesn't mean there aren't those that won't defend their country when they hear non-Russians talk about overthrowing their government and getting rid of its elected leader. I was offering my opinion as well. My opinion is that his opinion is neither sought nor required. > True, but at least he would be called for what he would be seen for what he is.   And? There won't be any real difference between Putin and some powerful oligarch for me. Same shit from other side. Okay, fair play. ex kgb  murderer?:  CNN told you? You'll be surprised but in the middle of 90s he won the votes for president and... shit himself! He is not a leader he is a clown. Try to explain that to people who lost everything and had no hope for better life in time that was called ""democracy"" by absolutely everybody. Don't bother--check out their comment histories for some idea of what views they're likely to advocate for. Irrational Russophobia, and you should try consuming media that isn't inherently biased against Russia.  > AFAIK he is part of them - have heard that right now he is one of the richest men in the world.  Once again: he is not a problem. The problem are people that we don't see/hear about. It's easy to judge a politician when you know nothing about behind-the-door politics. And all our politics are behind the door. Best we can judge is by other factors and other factors tell us that there are several groups of elites in the country. In 1999 Putin became a president because most groups supported him. Because he was a person that could keep shit together without ""siding"" with one group. He's a very important person and mindlessly removing him is asking for a disaster. After fall of USSR, after 1998 default, after 2008 and 2014 people don't need any more ""shocks"".  Also you can't just ""remove"" elites. These people, among many shit they've done, prevented Western powers from destroying us to stone age. If they're not there, then 90's will happen again and remaining USSR's legacy will be stolen once and for all.  > Ultimately - this is no kind of 'life'. Look at the world and see that other countries (and I'm not even talking about the US here) are able to exist with a far more civil society and realize we are all human beings and CAN attain what other people do if we can just figure out the right path.  I don't understand what kind of abstract bs you're spitting. Not sure about those two, but they would be state property if so, he doesn't get to keep it. You don't have to believe me, it won't make me enjoy my sweet car any less.  All my friends / people I meet are pretty successful in their respective fields, all it takes is hard work. It is a shame so many people are lazy or aren't very ambitious in Russia, but what can you do, hardly the government's fault. There might be, but currently I know of no such person. Out of 140 mln people that person probably exists somewhere out there, but it is much easier for a next in the power rankings oligarch to usurp power than for an actual good and fair leader to become the president.    Following the Ukraine example, was Poroshenko the best they could muster? No, he's arguably worse that the previous corrupt president. And that is how revolutions go to waste and bring only ruin. The thing about them is that they rarely lead to democracy, more often that not they cause chaos, the most ruthless and zealous men get an opportunity to seize absolute power for themselves, the way it happened in 1917.  You can't do everything immediately. Well said. I don't see Russia or Putin as this evil that wants to take over the world and I respect the Russian people's right to choose and be happy with whomever they pick as their leader. This is what I see: Putin dictated the outcome of our election.  He has violated something sacred.    If you want Russia to continue, remove him from power.  That's not a threat - that's simply a statement of reality.  America CAN'T forgive this.  Sooner or later the people he has harmed will be in power coincident with him and then it will all be fucked.  Please, I'm begging you - remove him from power.  The whole world needs this. C'mon man,  the guy is ex-KGB are you saying it's out of the question that he had a big mouth wacked?  >As far a people like Kasparov -main reason they flee west is nobody give the shit about them here, and there tha are heroic fighthers for freedom.  Oh, god what a load of shit.   I don't like Kasparov's politics myself, and I think he is utterly incompetent as a politician. However, he is very obviously committed to opposing Putin; it is the guy's raison d'tre.   Kasparov fled Russia because Boris Nemtsov warned him that he might be in danger. You know, [that Boris Nemtsov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Boris_Nemtsov).   Putin is a thug and a kleptocrat and I don't see how anyone can support him unless they are getting money from his corruption. In any case Putin's supporters deserve nothing but contempt. >As far a people like Kasparov -main reason they flee west is nobody give the shit about them here, and there tha are heroic fighthers for freedom.   Well, that's complete bullshit, but keep towing that Kremlin line.  I love how any time someone flees or is assassinated, the basic Kremlin talking point is how they weren't that important anyway. It is is a convenient way to dismiss a thug government that suppresses dissent.  But whatever helps you sleep at night! I think the word you're looking for is constrictive http://www.newsweek.com/trump-emails-rnc-reince-priebus-white-house-server-548191  They are using the RNC servers to correspond. Not quite Clinton, but still not a secured or auditable system. Edit: was doubting myself but u/codingalone found the link :) Yeah and same day it was reported three accounts got deleted.. Bannon and some others. Don't remember if the emails got wiped too..Here:  Newsweek reported that the emails of Bannon, Kushner and Conway had been deleted by the RNC since their story broke.  https://www.google.com/amp/www.newsweek.com/trump-emails-rnc-reince-priebus-white-house-server-548191%3Famp%3D1?client=ms-android-google  Lol even Russia today reported it.  I don't take your meaning, and you clearly don't take mine. And MacArthur was a huge idiot who wanted to start world war 3. So yep, you're right: you're hardly original, there have always been idiots. Yep. Russia is waging a massive disinformation campaign to weaken and divide Western society with internet trolls spreading conspiracies and lies. And they're very successful. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/51avn3/analysis_of_russias_information_war/) has a really detailed analysis on what they're doing if you're interested.  Welcome to the list! Google ""CIA pressure Iraq bush"" or similar and you'll find plenty.   Specifically, the PBS Frontline on the subject was particularly thorough.   http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB254/ http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/04/23/cia.iraq/ http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/23/world/a-nation-at-war-intelligence-cia-aides-feel-pressure-in-preparing-iraqi-reports.html  I forgive you. Now go, and sin no more. The shame is quite clearly in the execution of all the talent. After stealing all that expertise the masterstroke would be to nurture it and use it to fast-track the growth of your own innovative industries. You know, like the Chinese are doing. I can assure you that we would be very happy to turn places with you: 250 000 trucks for 20 000 000 victims of war.  Yep. Good add.  I don't have a problem with the strategy or the Russian people who worked on this endeavor. It was a very good one, and the Russians and Americans had a great working relationship - Russians proved highly intelligent, gracious, and capable partners.   I have a problem with Stalin erasing the history of the contributions of the Americans and his own incredible officials, and then murdering his own people for the sake of an ideological war. It was irrational and damaging to his own people - it's a tragedy.   Certainly American's role wasn't selfless - no one would argue that. But Kahn's motives weren't purely greed either, he was a good man. It's not the American's fault that Stalin put 70% of the budget into military industrialization and kept the people poor and starving so they couldn't break from the party. That's on Stalin.   Also, I'm a woman.  Well you should share your knowledge if you would like others to be educated instead of simply saying the GP is wrong.  Thank you! And he built that empire on a foundation of millions of dead Russians. And how exactly did massacring tens of thousands of innocent people make the USSR a 'superpower'?  You make me feel like I care more about Russians being killed than actual Russians do. Actually, it was Lend-Lease.  Every Katyusha rode on a Studebaker truck.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studebaker_US6 Putin will pave the way for someone a lot worse than he is. And the cycle will keep repeating. Its known that many Russians have protested against Putin in the past but presently he has gained the upper hand via a lot of PR and intimidation.  But one thing about human beings - nothing is ever 'over'. Any battle lost today can be won tomorrow. > Putin has actual 80% support of his people.  And if his support was actually a lot lower than that - how would you know?  Well - considering that under Communism people were in theory not supposed to accumulate any wealth at ALL - sure Russians have more money then they used to, but compared to first world nations Russians are relatively very poor except for a handful of oligarchs and gangsters. What is it about your current economy that makes you think it is so far superior to say, Sweden's? You really think you have it better then them? If so, why? Yeah man, your economy is like a potato. Super simple. Petroleum, gas, wood. Natural resources.   I don't think you really ever moved past Brezhnevs economics.   You know what the US exports? Jet engines. Electronics. Medicine.   Https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Russia_Export_Treemap.png  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/United_States_Export_Treemap.png  Let's be real. Oil is gone. Venezuela is a failed state. Do you want to be Venezuela?   Edit: ...and if you think Trump makes your Oligarchs rich before his friends, I think you're in for a real treat.  Yeah, instead just lube up your ass for Putin to do whatever he wants. I don't see why Russians are so anti-gay when they pretty much get fucked by a man on a regular basis. Typical bydlo mentality. No, it is not. Its the truth. Russia can do better. TFW when you challenge someone, they drop the mic, **pick it up again, and drop it a second time**.  This chain is 10/10, Ouroboros is a little strange folks. I'm way confused now, the media has led me to believe Putin kills anyone who opposes his POV...You're saying that's not the case? That isn't 'better' - I want to see you write a post lambasting Putin that could be used against you as evidence. I think 'ribadi' is having to go check with 'somebody' to see how far he/she is  permitted to go. If your country is in as good a shape as you think it is - he would  not have to be 'overthrown' but could just be voted out of office.  From what I hear, free and fair elections are not a reality in Russia right now  - but who knows, maybe I am wrong.  >when they hear non-Russians  really though - this IS a primarily American website...not to mention most Americans are much more ignorant about Russia then me...a lot think its still a communist country. [removed] Well no, this is a well established fact... I would be, if that were true. I know he got close in 96, but Yeltsin won (in no small part because all the oligarchs and western business interests were against him). Granted, I'd prefer a social democrat over a communist, but he was actually popular and capable of winning not so long ago.  What are you talking about, him winning and shitting himself? Russia average income is below that of even Poland or Hungary - you can do better. Literally Russian shills. People who doubt this theory, do you really think this many Russians come into an American social media website to defend their motherland? Come on. Wake the fuck up. Bucharest-born here.   It's not Russophobia. It's anti-imperialism, directed at Moscow.   The USSR didn't need to park it's ass in Romania for **SIXTY YEARS**.   They should have GTFO by the 50's.   At least we didn't get invaded like CZ.    I like Russians a lot - but it does not mean I think they have the best interests of my country at heart - and therefore we should not be under Russian control.  How is that 'irrational'? > The problem are people that we don't see/hear about  What makes you think you are seeing/hearing everything about Putin?  > He's a very important person and mindlessly removing him is asking for a disaster.  A few years ago I was reading a lot about Tsar Ivan IV and its interesting how the argument for keeping that lunatic (granted he was far worse than Putin) in power was exactly this.  >I don't understand what kind of abstract bs you're spitting.  Human history. Yeah I heard they're going to be turned into elementary schools when he's done being president for life.   You sound like a beaten wife making excuses. Time to leave honey.  Dude, the fact that you need to boast that you have a Lexus... lol... anyway, I understand you.. its our things.  > It is a shame so many people are lazy or aren't very ambitious in Russia,   That's very true.   > but what can you do, hardly the government's fault.  It is a consequence of our history of socialism, that made people become complacent with whatever they get in life convinced that they cant do anything to get better.   And yes, it is the government fault, because Putin actually did some great things but to keep his power and control and carry on with his ambitious expansionist agenda he's still cultivating old mentalities that turn people into numb sheep supporting whatever he does. He doesn't want the Russian people to evolve to much otherwise they may evolve to become to smart and represent competition or challenge him and his cronies. He keeps most people in the pseudo social state mentality limbo and only a few actually succeed, but they are not a large portion of the population, so they are easy to control also.  It is true that a significant portion of the younger generations (below 40 years old) have an active and professional life, almost at the level of the West, but that is mostly due to the way how we became open to it after the 90's. Russia was going on a great path, and we were not only reaching Western levels of life, but also merging with it, benefiting from mutual beneficial relationships, trade, exchange of knowledge, technology, etc...  But than our dear fucking leader decided to go rough with his agenda, and most people instead of realising how fucking backwards it was and call him up to act wise and with the interests of the people in mind, no, we just decided to support him and put ourself in the backwards track, and the world's trust on Russia is back to pre-90's.   Thanks Putin!       God Russia is filled with defeatists, no wonder history shits on you losers repeatedly. Guess you're just too used to being slaves, it's been bred into you.  Have fun getting shit on instead of looking for someone better. Don't forget to drink yourself to death. ""Putin dictated the outcome of our election.""  It's just way to stupid. My head hurts. I think you just gave me braincancer.   Well, my point of view. You had election and side, who is lost using Russia as a scapegoat (not sure if its right word) for their major fuck up. It's funny to watch, but not our problem.  Also, if it comes to begging - can your country stop overthrowing goverments, creating space for things like ISIS and generaly fucking whole world up just to keep world leader positions. We all would be in your debt, if you could do that.   There's still no public evidence that Russia interfered with the election. The last release was a joke, nothing in it pointed to Russia in it the slightest. This world starts to frighten me. Because I sincerely don't understand whether you are a troll or a sophisticated algorithm that is meant to represent an average neo-liberal. Scary shit. Lmao. Please don't speak for America, you are embarrassing us. First of all - demonisation of KGB is the legacy of Cold War. Most of KGB, FSB officers as just very educated, best of the best specialists handling all kind of operations. There are probably some assasination programms in place, but you know, secret and separate. It like calling every US military a murderer, cause you drone programm or some other shit.  Second - why would he do it. There are obviosly would be bing noise about it, he oviosly would be blamed for it by west, but where is the profit? What he can say, what anybody else can't and didn't say all the time. Also - if you lived in Russia, you would know that assasination of Nemtsov was biggest new story for a long time. In our federal channels. Hi got most attention than like 20 years before, after he got out of goverment. Why? There is 0 profit, there is a lot of loss. Also - thin about Nemtsov is, he was hated by most population in Russia. He was a part of a team, who destroyed our county, who managed proccess wich cost lives, homes, livehood for millons russians. If i saw him on the street, and i would have gun in my hands, it would be very hard for me to not shot the fucker. The fact that he, and other like him opposing Putin - actualy give him much more credibility. It's like tell me who is your enemy and i tell you who you are.  I know who Boris Nemtsov is very well. I don't know who shot him, but it definatl wan't a goverment.   And yeah, somewhat like 60-80% of Russia populations, according to diferent polls are paid by Putin to support him.  That's like, just your opinion.   There are thouthands of people critisizing Kremlin in Russia. Pretty bing media too. People actualy making good money out of it, from all this western grant for ""develping democracy"".   Why the all working here, but Kasparov just had to flee?  There are so many words in russian created from latin on english words, sometimes i just take russian version, make it more ""englishy"" and hope for the best. Works more often than you would think:). Not this time though.  Yeah, I think you're right. Not quite the irony I was hoping for. Thanks for posting that though. Solid research good sir.  Once Trump starts printing out highly classified material for his maid, I will be equally as upset. We were in a good position to win WW3 at that time. Yes I'm one of the cool kids now!  Edit: Putin can lick my balls.  See, without the Studebakers, even *more* Soviet troops would've died.   That's because with or without American support, Soviet doctrine was *medieval*. Hence the *tiny* proportion of US casualties in the war - we had exponentially better force protection (not to mention better field hospitals).  US fire support by the end of WWII was greater, at a platoon level, than the Soviets ever had, even in the 80's (this is due to a doctrinal difference, that leaves the Soviet commander with a few mortars as his *only* direct fire support). Conversely, ever since WWII, US commanders have been able to grab the radio-man, and request air support - even if that air support is under a different command.   It's called combined arms.  Nobody blames US, dear lady. It's just a bit naive to suspect that Stalin or any other if he was in Stalin's place could get away with industrialisation without putting all efforts into military first. Otherwise this newborn industrial nation would become a delicious meal for any imperialistic power of that time, including US, and we both know that.      It's easier to dismiss the sacrifices that were made by generation of that time as unnessesary, rather than respect them and be thankful. If you want, I can share my knowledge with you - ask away. But the intention of my post wasn't proving GP wrong, but expressing the actual amusement. ...please don't embarass yourself. Read about the History of the USSR, read it carefully then check in again and delete your comment.  Your one dimensional thinking is exactly why people don't take /r/politics seriously.   The massacer did happen but claiming thats the only thing he did is just ignorant and shallow minded  You could make a case that Trotzki would have made a much better and sane successor but thats mainly speculation Russia has rarely seen widespread protests.  Putin has been always very popular in Russia, his popularity has never dropped under 50 %.  There is no doubt that Russian government has quite some control over TV (which is the major source of information for nearly 90 % of russians), but it's not like there's no free press or private controlled televisions as well, and internet is not censored. You can find Russians reading reddit as well.  There's without a doubt a good dose of intimidation on opposition press (yet, it's not really derived from the government, I recommend you the documentary Putin's Kiss about it).  All that to say that while Russia does not rank among the most free press countries in the world is definitely a far shot from tyranny.  And to explain Putin's popularity simply by tv control is rather blind. There's plenty of countries around the world that had much less press freedom (and freedom in general) that have seen riots, protests and even rebellions (just see the arab spring).  To understand why Putin is pretty popular you have to understand what Russia's been in the 80s and 90s. A very miserable place, coups, instability, extremely bad politicians (Gorbachev and even worst, Yeltsin). Russia's seen a debt default and huge poverty in the 90s, isolation and being meaningless on the international stage (see Yugoslavia). Unemployment reached a historical high. Yeltsin even bombed its own parliament and Russia managed to get beaten in Chechnya. And not even considering the big hoarding of state industries sold for cheap to foreigners and Russian oligarchs in a giant cleptocracy.  Then Putin comes, brings you prosperity, nationalizes many of the industries and sectors that corrupted oligarchs had their hands on (gazprom, rosfnet, ecc), a prosperity that Russia never enjoyed compared to other countries, in its history. Brings you stability, reinforces the army, makes territorial gains around its borders, brings back Crimea to the Russian Federation, unemployment falls at one of the lowest on earth (sub 4 %), military grows and Russia starts meaning something on the world stage again and its allies (like Syria) do not get fucked in the arse like Serbia did while Moscow could do little but watch.  So again, why would a Russian consider to not vote Putin when he did, till now, a solid job at securing food on Russian's plates, security from a military standpoint and prestige?  My family grew in communist Poland, do you think people cared that much about generic ""democracy""?  What we cared for? Can we afford to buy a car next year? What tv should we buy? Where do we want to go on vacations? Should I buy the latest Beatles musicasette or the Rolling Stones one?  Everyday problems like most of the world, it's not like political activism was our first preoccupation, we wanted to enjoy a good life and more or less we did.  Sure, we enjoy modern poland even more, economy's even better, we don't have ratios on meat, there's much more choices in food and stuff, we like it. There are stuff we didn't really had before (criminality and poverty) but overall the average Pole does better.  So I'm hardly surprised Russians have a high support for Putin. If it were higher, how would you know? The fact that he's still in power is telling. Just because a lot of Americans don't like him doesn't mean the Russians shouldn't like him too. American feelings and sensibilities aren't universally valid. Late answer but its quite clear that russians like him. May this be due to propaganda or killing off dissident reporters but anyhow he is a very popular leader and more than getting rid of him russians are concerned that there isnt an alternative and others would be worse. He has risen their national spirit and quality of life, made russia great again and played the eu/us leaders like a fiddle.  what do you mean by very poor? have you even been in russia? problem is a lot of people have opinion about russia created by media, not reality  I have now idea and i don't judge about things i have no idea.  I know for a fact our economy and level of life are became way, like way better since Putin became president.   And being unhappy with some policy and decisions, wich i am regulary, is very far from desire to overthrow goverment and bring our coutry to hell - like Iraq, Libya, Siriya, Ukraine and actualy Russia in 90s. Already saw that shitshow.  jet engines, electronics, medicine the fact that they are not exporting it does not mean they do not make it I don't happy about our economy too. While what you say is far from truth, still. But what is has to do with Putin being tyrant and we needing a revolution. I asked many times here already. How exactly am i slave of Putin, in this version - how exactly am i being fucked by Putin?   You in the other hand - clearly just watching you mainstream media - believing in them, like good catholic girl believe in Jesus and say shit like that.  What? Desire to decide your fate, live by your own choises is a ""bydlo metality""? You should realy look that word up.  Calling for people to overthrow an elected leader because he hurt your feelings is arrogant and it's a reason why you won't get along with them. I agree with Trump that America should have a better relationship with Russia, being the only superpower doesn't mean America has to force everyone under it's thumb. I hope you are joking. But yeah, thats not the case. That is as far from the case as it could be.  Okay, i hate Putin and wan't him dead. He is a horrible person and we should immediatly start a revoluton.   Are you happy?  You might just be a Russophobe Well I heard former president Obama was a Muslim, I also heard Tupac was alive in Cuba, What you 'hear' doesn't make it fact, unless real evidence is forthcoming. Putin is widely supported and that's the reason he was elected and still remains president, their country, their way, their rules. It's arrogant for outsiders to talk about overthrowing the government they don't like, the only thing that matters is that Russians like him.  Fair play on this being an American website, nobody is denying that. America is a great country full of great people and I'm willing to bet most Russians will agree but some of the rhetoric can be disrespectful to downright scary sometimes.  Good. I'm glad you defend others giving opinions when it's an opinion you agree with.  Calling for an overthrow of a government is disrespectful and arrogant, you don't run the world and you should respect others living in it. Worry about your own government and stop telling others what to do. that he was KGB, yes that he is murder, no The true results of elections in 96 - communists won. And Zyuganov did nothing with that because 1) he had (and now have) all the goods that he want 2) he is not communist in fact but a puppet of goverment.   Bolee togo... oh how to say it in English... more then that - in the end of the USSR there were a huge vote where people of USSR were asked about the fate of the Union - do they want a democracy or communism. And of course the biggest part of people chosed the communism but no fuckin one leader of any country hadn't done anything with that.   The only times when all the world is blaming Russia with incorrect behavior is when Russia trying to do something good for themselves. When Russia destroing own country and people nobody gives a shit. That is a historical fact.   Before You will tell me that Ivan 4, Pyotr 1, Stalin and Putin a bloody dictators, try to imagine how many shit have been given on they period of time. BTW most of shit were from the West ;-)  P.s. I'm not a communist and I want peace to Russia and America because we both are really the best countries in the world =) Peace!   Yeah, you would prefer U.S. parking their ass in your country and fucking your women. > What makes you think you are seeing/hearing everything about Putin?  I never stated that anywhere.  > A few years ago I was reading a lot about Tsar Ivan IV and its interesting how the argument for keeping that lunatic (granted he was far worse than Putin) in power was exactly this.  As Bashkir I can say that Ivan IV was pretty reasonable. No, they will be used by the following government officials, that's what government property is for. I'm not boasting, you suggested we're all surviving on carrots, I stated that I have a higher standard of living than most people in western countries, that's all.  See, I don't think you can blame Putin for the worsening in relations. Let's be honest, the west started a massive propaganda campaign against us, it was evident during the 2008 war in Georgia when they blamed us for that war even though we did the right thing. They later released the real facts but they were glanced over and a lot of idiots on reddit still think we started that war.  It was then evident during the olympics, making up bs, but I guess they do that to all olympics. Then Ukraine, their media legitimised a violent overthrow of the government and then made up bs about us doing right by the people of Crimea.  Putin would love to be good friends with the west, but the west is so PC and SJW and their human emotions have no outlet, so they make Russia the scapegoat and let all their inner xenophobia and bigotry out on Russia. Get used to it, it's all coming to you too. Many dictators have started  their rule after being democratically elected.  History shows us as one of the most influential and important states to ever exist, what you on about with your eugenics? We'll handle Trumpler.  You handle Putin.  That's all either of us can promise.  But if either of us fails, the whole world is fucked. Purely out of curiosity, what are your thoughts on Trump admitting that it was probably Russia that hacked the DNC? Do you think he's being dishonest as well, and simply playing along with the rest of the intelligence community in this ""farce""?  *This being asked in text, I feel I have to say I'm not criticizing you or saying one thing or another about you. I'm genuinely curious.* ""Us""?  You're seriously claiming to be American, Boris?  ROFL Right, and the government definitely didn't kill Alexander Litvinenko or Anna Politkovskaya either. :|  I didn't say that everyone who supports Putin is payed by him. It should be obvious to people who have the information that Putin is a glorified mafia boss. Support for him is very short sighted, and will be bad for Russia in the long run, even if Russian people don't see it now... I would bet that Hitler got very high approval ratings after annexing Austria and the Sudetenland as well. KGB general says Kasparov's life in danger[edit] Speaking about Kasparov, former KGB general Oleg Kalugin in 2007 remarked, ""I do not talk in detailspeople who knew them are all dead now because they were vocal, they were open. I am quiet. There is only one man who is vocal and he may be in trouble: [former] world chess champion [Garry] Kasparov. He has been very outspoken in his attacks on Putin and I believe that he is probably next on the list.""  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Kasparov#Politics lol I understand how that can be, I've heard Russian and English are difficult languages to go between.    It's the same with English and Romance languages as well, the words *should* be the same but aren't. Yes, an idiot might have thought so. >[**How many people has Communism killed ? [2:20]**](http://youtu.be/kOnIp69r6vg)  > [*^RedArmyUncle*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBAnAga8iTjKiwARP_yxmog) ^in ^News ^& ^Politics  >*^61,924 ^views ^since ^Aug ^2014*  [^bot ^info](/r/youtubefactsbot/wiki/index) I'm not trying to disrespect those that sacrificed a lot for the safety of the nation. I already articulated that it was a good policy, for the most part. However, you cannot convince anyone that all of it was necessary. The purges especially are indefensible. Instead of killing his experts and erasing history he could have invested in his people.  i mean not adding any context or correction (assuming some exists) is basically just letting those beliefs propagate themselves, so i guess its good that they're so amusing. its an interesting reaction, ill give you that Would you care to now? I believe that's what he was asking - you know, derision shedding no light and all that.  I've read plenty about the History of the USSR - and probably from books a lot less biased then most soviets grew up reading.  But getting back to the mass purging of tens of thousands of people - in what ways did this help your country? >The massacer did happen but claiming thats the only thing he did is just ignorant and shallow minded  Yeah the only people who achieved 0% unemloyment in history are Hitle and Stalin. Such visionary people. You must be really smart to see the genious behind all that.  Step 1. Kill/Starve millions Step 2. Redistribute wealth Step 3. Be a visionary leader who build a Superpower.  Your multidimensional thinking is through the roof. this is r/worldnews Look, I am not a young person...I remember very well when Gorbachev decided to just 'end' Communism without any alternative plans in place and having a very, VERY bad feeling about what would happen. In broad terms, I am not surprised at all by what has happened in years since.  All I can say is that as long as Russians are going to choose to engage in conversations on a US-based forum, I might as well suggest to them that there IS a different way of thinking, as IMO a lot of Russians have a historically entrenched bleak viewpoint about human nature - things do not HAVE to be the way they are.     > If it were higher, how would you know?   Because if were higher you can be sure it was made known, because he has control over the polling.  Russia is basically economically a 2nd world nation when under a less corrupt government it could be a lot better off.  But look, I am unhappy with Trump and think that a lot of Americans voted against OUR self-interest too - its not as if this problem is unique to Russia. http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/inequality-and-the-putin-economy-inside-the-numbers/ > I have now idea and i don't judge about things i have no idea.  Maybe you should read up on what's going on in the rest of the world and gain some understanding of how much better things could be for you in Russia.  And I'm not even going to bother propping up America at this point, but read up on Scandinavia and their quality of life. If they can do it - you can do it too. Yeah I really don't get why every dipshit here is saying you should overthrow putin. Putin is no angel but he could be far worse. I also imagine (I'm from US so I am ignorant of average russian life) that the average russian has a decent life, much better if compared to how bad life usually becomes during a revolution or regime overthrow.  TL DR: Revolution is not something to be taken lightly. > I know for a fact our economy and level of life are became way, like way better since Putin became president.  Yes, and so did Romania's after joining NATO and the EU.   You should have joined the EU and NATO.   -----------------------------------------------------  See the problem with that logic?   **EVERY** Warsaw Pact country's economy hit the shitter in the 90's.   We *all* did better in the 2000's.    Have you ever been outside Russia? How is it far from the truth?  I get it. Yeltsin fucked up after he finally ended the insanity. But the wrong people took over. You can't blame anyone. The economy was shocked into capitalism, like serfdom was shocked into autocracy and socialism.   Russia just needs to stop the cycle of falling into autocracy and oligarchy. Before it was Tzar and Church, now it's Putin and Oligarch.    Diversify guys. Stop concentrating power.  OK - what about this:  Do you think your government is still following the intent of the law, do you live in a free society? How would you feel about the way Putin runs Russia if the economy was doing very poorly? I don't recall Putin ever 'hurting my feelings' - I just think Russia could be in a lot better shape than it is now with better leaders who are more interested in serving the best interests of the people there as opposed to enriching themselves.   No dude, i'm not! I'm not even American but that's how i thought it was. I'm Nigerian and we have the perception that we're way better off than Russia. Damn...the propaganda against Russia must be working... Why do you hate him - what are the things he did that you strongly disagree with?  And don't put 'are you happy' in the end of the post. We'll just assume people reading this thread understand we are engaging in an 'exercise' here. I might, but there is a lot I admire about Russians and as an 'artsy' type person, many of my favorite writers/composers/filmmakers are Russian. More likely just a troll having fun here. I guess I need to define terms. Do you consider someone a murderer if they hire an assassin? Or order someone's assassination? I don't understand why they would they rig an election against a puppet. If he posed no threats to the oligarchs because he wasn't an actual communist, why oppose him?   But also, what's your source of these ""true"" results?  >fucking your women.  I'm not going to find any redpill posts if I check your history am I> Well, it's made our GDP rise more in a decade than 50 years of Warsaw Pact did for us, so yeah. > that Ivan IV was pretty reasonable.  Uh, no, he was either driven insane by exposure to (I think) lead poisoning or more probably, schizophrenic. He truly was a horrible tyrant and for those not familiar with him, he killed his own son and only genuine heir in a fit of rage.  But yes, I am aware that with the Russian inclination to love abusive rulers, he and Stalin definitely have many fans. > I stated that I have a higher standard of living than most people in western countries,  Just because you have a fucking Lexus?? You have no fucking idea...  Sure, not everybody in the West have a Lexus, but just because they dont have one doesn't mean they live worst then you.   What's the point of driving a Lexus when half of the places around are junk and there's people living in misery?  Go to the West and boast you have a car, and you will see people telling you, ""so what? how many salaries did you have to put asside in order to afford it?"".   We didn't even know what was a color TV they were already having a color TV in every single house. Many of the things that we consider an extra or a luxury to our lives it's a normal in Wetern people's lives. Dude, you have really no idea.   And you have a pair of Nikes too?? Everybody has those and don't even think about it. It is normal, it is shoes.   And you boast you have a Lexus, but I would like to see what do you lack and I would be telling you, ""you don't have this but you have a fucking Lexus?""  I bet your Lexus is the only thing you can show as having a life higher than normal, but everything else is far from the same level. What's the point? Just for show off! Typical Russian. Have things just to show off.  Go to the West and whomever has a Lexus, has everything else at the same level, and Lexus actually is not that much of an impressive car there. Just above average thats it.   >See, I don't think you can blame Putin for the worsening in relations. Let's be honest, the west started a massive propaganda campaign against us, it was evident during the 2008 war in Georgia when they blamed us for that war even though we did the right thing. They later released the real facts but they were glanced over and a lot of idiots on reddit still think we started that war.  I guess Chechnia gave them good reasons to think that way at first. Ever thought about that??  > It was then evident during the olympics, making up bs, but I guess they do that to all olympics.   Dude, Ukraine was already getting fed up for a while with Yanukovich, tried and consumed with his chain of corruption all over the country. Did you even know his story? The Family? Do you think we did the right thing to protect him when we was basically bloodsucking the country?? Also, you should be careful with the stories that you believe about Ukraine. I go there at least twice a year and the reality they show us here in Russia is far from the reality there. People there have traveled West and seen much better than they have, or even we have. What do you expect??  >and then made up bs about us doing right by the people of Crimea.  There was no threat to the people of Crimea. And anyway it was an illegal annexation. But that's fine with me... however, did Putin really needs to send his dogs, a bunch of criminals to start a war in Donbass?? Or do you really believe there was a threat against the Russian speakers?? Or that there was a ground for a civil war?  People were pissed, but not to the point of start a war. Dude, I have family in Donetsk and they are starting to hate us for that.   > Putin would love to be good friends with the west, but the west is so PC and SJW and their human emotions have no outlet, so they make Russia the scapegoat and let all their inner xenophobia and bigotry out on Russia.  So, for you is also the West fault. We are perfect and we do no wrong. But guess what?? For some reason the West is way more advanced than us in many things and they don't have the natural resources that we do and still send us their money to buy from us. Still they manage to do better! Why?? Because they are worst??  I suggest you to go see the world pall. Not only see, but assimilate for a while without pre made judgements and you will be impressed like I did, and you'll understand why many of us that go thee chose to stay and live there, like the children of our politicians. Yes... why do you think they send their children there?? Why do you think they buy houses there and invest there?  Dude... It is that fucking mentality that keeps us backwards, continuing being just a bunch of wildlings tamed by a tough leader. We don't want to merge, be equals because we have the fucking mentality that we are better or do better than others when we could just be equals. We don't accept criticism, we don't accept that we do mistakes. How can we improve when we believe we are already perfect??   And don't come with the BULSHIT that we are the West scapegoat. Scapegoat for what?? They don't fucking need us. They don't give a shit about us if we don't cause trouble.   Its not THEM, it is US, we are the ones always using the West as a scapegoat.   We need to look into ourselves, change our mentality and once for all see that actually we are the ones who need to change and evolve.   Do you think we are more evolved??  Russia was the last European country to maintain the institution of serfdom. While serfdom died out in western europe more then 700 years ago, litle more than 100 years ago we still had it here. A wide majority of Russians were virtualy slaves, and only a tiny pertion were the lords of everything.   Why do you think we are so sensitive to oligarchism, and everybody wants to be a high shot or a mafia boss?  This slow evolution contributes to the toxic blend of nihilism and a certain feeling of 'worthlessness' on the part of the average Russian psyche. We basically feel that human beings are animals and the only way to keep order is via a 'strong hand'.  So we have Putin.   Wake up sheeple!  >Get used to it, it's all coming to you too.  I doubt it. That's not what eugenics is. Let's just say i disagree.  No, but I do want people like you to stop being so melodramatic, it's ridiculous. You can't even stay on topic, you're flying off the handle. I'm not the guy you originally asked, but I'll answer. Keep in mind that I didn't vote for trump, and don't hold out much hope he will be a good president.   I think it's plausible it was Russia. But the evidence we have... Is pretty light on convincing details. At least the evidence publicly available. However, it's all part of the game everyone plays. This is why network security should be taken more seriously. And really, not being corrupt and shitty would be better in the first place...   My dislike of Clinton started before this. The email stuff, dnc corruption, etc, just added to it. I wasn't going to vote for her either way.  By 'neo-liberal' I mean a person that beleives that freedom and happines are the supreme values for humanity and should be enforced at all costs. Economical and social instruments like trade or immigration policy are just a tools and are irrelevant without the context. If you have a diferrent definition then feel free to state it. I don't realy give a shit about Litvinenko, hi was a traior, so if they kill them, okay. While all this story with polonium is way to stupid, sounds like a stunt ot me.  Politovkaya - yeah, definatly not goverment. I think her killers was captured and sentenced a long time ago. Also never heard of her, before she died, bet you too.   If hear this, ""obvious, well known, common knowledge"" and shit like that all time, to bad never with facts backing it up. You just listen to media, and bevieve them, nothing more.   Hehehe. Yeah, USA would never used traitor, sentenced for treason in Russia  as a tool for propoganda.  You need to be such a fool to belive that shit.  Again. Thouthands of people are vocal, very open in their critic of Putin and goverment. Why that all are not dead yet?  What a compelling rebuttal! What a compelling rebuttal!

"5",4,"5ra6c3","2017-01-31","Serious question (and I don't know much about the subject): aren't the settlers just  a slow-motion annexation of Palestine? Seems like they'll just take over the whole damn area.  There goes the Israelis again.  Forcefully evacuating people from their homes.  oh, wait... In this thread: People disagreeing about what the facts are without any citation to authoritative references. its crazy to think people risk their lives, peace and security fighting over shitty land thats barely the size of vancouver island. maybe they shouldve made israel in canada instead of palestine, wouldve saved the jews and the world a whole lot of headache ITT: Israel is doing something good but it's not enough because they are Satan  [removed] good first step.  I'm always confused about israel/palestine issues.  Didn't england give Israel a state after WWII.  Than after one of the wars with egypt/jordan/etc, the arabs demanded a palestinian state and were obliged in some peace accord with a arab/palestinian state being formed in gaza and the west bank.  Are these settlers Palestinians or israelis? Or neither? Does Israel claim the West Bank? Thank God. When will Israel get a sensible government that can see that these settlements do no good?  Anyone think this would continue to happen if the US threatened to cease support for Israel until this stops? Good.  But as compensation: [3000 new settler homes!](http://www.timesofisrael.com/government-okays-another-3000-new-settlement-homes/) I hope this doesn't lead to violence, whether between Settlers and the IDF, or perpetrated by Israelis on Palestinians as a ""Price Tag"". Israel is the biggest terrorist country in the world  but since they hold all the ropes of the US and media, they dont know any laws or rules and do whatever they want  so basically there are not international laws, humanitarian bullshit etc if you are strong  That is the long term strategy. the west bank was taken from Jordan not Palestine.  So, instead of conspiracy theories, heres an actual answer:   Most of the building today is done in areas that are already agreed to be swapped for other land (think of this every time you hear a condemnation of an approval of housing units in settlements). No one in their right minds will think of moving everyone in *[Ariel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_\(city\))* behind the green line, for exmaple. So there's absolutely no reason not to build further.    Outposts and illegal settlements are a more touchy subject. Israel has its own definition for illegality of settlements, and it acts upon it (though not with the same vigor as other crimes committed). Those Israel agrees to evacuate in any future two-state scenario, as they are far smaller, remote, and on non-contiguous land.    If you want to see where Israel actually discusses annexation - it does so in the open. Minister Bennet, chairman of the right wing Jewish Home party wants to annex [Area C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_C_\(West_Bank\)) (where the vast majority of settlers live) with some land swaps, give citizenship to the Arabs living there (a small minority - a few thousands), and then move from there to a separate, demilitarized Palestinian nation-type entity in areas A and B (where the P.A today has administrative-civilian control, and where the majority of Palestinians live in the West Bank).   Another detailed annexation plan was drawn up by MK Yoav Kish of the Likud party.   A third type of annexation plan that is discussed (though I suspect not seriously) is to create non-contiguous Palestinian ""emirates"" in the West Bank cities, with an umbrella Palestinian federal government.    In the case of Amona, the settlement discussed in the article - there's a legal question regarding the ownership of the lands (Amona residents claim they legally bought it if I'm not mistaken, Palestinians claimed it was theirs but they simply had not been there for decades, and so on and so on). It's a very long-winded, complicated legal debate that I don't know the full details of, but the government eventually reached an understanding with the settlers under which they will leave their houses in return for compensation.  Settlers, yeah. Israel? No. Israel has continually said that it would give about 95% of the West Bank in a eventual partition.  Yes that is exactly the plan  It's only annexation if they're under Israeli administration. Currently, any settlement built outside area C, is illegal and to be dismantled. That is, they're not under Israeli administration.   Areas C, where Israeli citizens are eligible to build, there is partial Israeli administration but not annexed because these lands are officially slated to be transferred to the PA once the Oslo Accords decision implementation resumes.    Israel had shown no issues in its short history to dismantle large settlement blocks in land concession deals parts of peace offers.    Gaza settlements - gone. Given to the PA.  Sinai settlements - gone. Given to Egypt.  Since the top answer is complete garbage (both a detail-free slogan, *and* factually wrong), and the rest are a bit too elaborate, I'll give it a go: no, it's not a slow-motion annexation of Palestine.   First of all, you need to understand that Israel has no need for any kind of a ""slow-motion"" annexation, let alone ""taking over the whole damn area"". It already took over 100% of the West Bank and Gaza in 1967,  half a century ago. It could annex 100% of it *the next day*, or at least in 1980, when it annexed the Golan Heights and Jerusalem. And it wouldn't need *a single settlement* for that. Annexation is literally just a Knesset decision, and it has nothing to do with how many Jews currently live there.  The reason it hasn't done so, in 50 years, is not because it didn't have enough settlements there. Or, as I just showed, because it had some aversion to annexing territories it conquered in 1967. It's simply because Israelis overwhelmingly **don't want** all of the West Bank and Gaza to be part of Israel. They don't want to be in the same country as 4 million Palestinians who want them dead. And since the settlements project has started, the Palestinian population in those territories *quadrupled*, making annexation even less appealing.  Now, you *could* say that this is an annexation of the parts Israel *wants*. That is, East Jerusalem, with the Western Wall and the Jewish Quarter, the Jewish section of Hebron, certain parts with strategic military value and so on. The idea is to make ""facts on the ground"", so when Israel does withdraw from the parts it doesn't want (like the actual areas where Palestinians live), it could keep those parts. But ""taking over the whole damn area"" is the exact *opposite* of what the settlements were trying to achieve.  Yes, after a war Israel started which is more accurately referred to as *conquest*.  The settlement is illegal even under Israeli law (others are only illegal under international law). The one that gave the order to force them out wasn't the Israeli government, but their supreme court and that order came from 2014.  And as the article mentioned, it's the biggest outpost out of more than 100 that are illegal under both international and Israeli laws. There are many more outposts bigger than that one that are legal under Israeli law, but illegal under international laws. The Israeli supreme court can't do anything against them, since they can only judge depending on their own laws, if it was legalized in Israel, then the supreme court can't close it.  The settlers also aren't going to be moved out of the occupied territories, they just get moved to a different settlement. They are moving them to new settlements in the occupied Palestinian Territories that are illegal under international law and condemned by 100% of countries on the earth. Israel's distinctions between 'legal' and 'illegal' settlements aren't accepted by anyone outside of Israel.  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/31/israel-west-bank-settlement-homes No, what's crazy is that the whole world is using this small conflict as an outlet for their own aspirations by focusing on it disproportionately and arming both sides. While many more people die in other conflicts and nobody even knows about it or cares. That's what I always thought too. If Jews really ran the world like some people believe, why didn't they choose a tropical island somewhere not surrounded by people who hate them? Only 'Little Satan' though  How is illegal settlers moving from one illegal settlement to another illegal settlement a 'good thing'? You must be living in a bubble if you think that anybody that doesn't agree with you must be paid or something. It's been like that for quite some time:  http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-23695896  >Israel: Government pays students to fight internet battles  http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/08/14/israel-students-social-media/2651715/  >Israel is looking to hire university students to post pro-Israel messages on social media networks  without needing to identify themselves as government-linked, officials said Wednesday.   http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/students-offered-grants-if-they-tweet-pro-israeli-propaganda-8760142.html  >Students offered grants if they tweet pro-Israeli propaganda  Take a look at the post history of the OP of this thread by the way. > Holy shit the Israel Online Defense academy or some shit is a lose on reddit.  Or maybe we just don't buy into the innocent Palestinian circle jerk. You must be new here.   Good, now the Palestinians should make their step. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/31/israel-west-bank-settlement-homes England split Palestine into Israeli and palestinian sections. The Arabs basically said this was unacceptable and there could only be a palestinian state and attempted to conquer the Israeli portion, and lost and Israel then expanded it's borders. Jordan absorbed the palestinian portion that was left... and they invaded again, and again, loosing more land each time, until Isreal just occupied all the land and made the separate Palestinian land a region partially under their control but with its own government. The settlements are communities built in this occupied Palestinian territory that follow the government of Isreal.   Some Palestinians want a ""Two-State"" solution where Israel recognizes Palestine as a seperate country and stops occupying it, but there is debate on where the border should be since Isreal moved it further every time they won a war. while others still think Israel has no right to exist and think the end goal should be to still conquer it.  > Didn't england give Israel a state after WWII. Than after one of the wars with egypt/jordan/etc, the arabs demanded...  England promised the Palestinians and other Arab groups their own states if they would rise up and help overthrow the Ottoman Empire during World War ONE (the McMahonHussein Correspondence).  Then, after the Palestinians and other groups agreed and did what the British asked, the British and the French took over the entire Middle East as their 'protectorates'.  In 1917, nearing the end of the war, the British also promised ""the Jews"" (really just some European Jewish groups that claimed to speak for all Jewish people) that they could settle in the Levant, provided that such settlement did not infringe upon the extant rights of the indigenous population (which, itself, already included a small but significant and ancient Jewish minority).  At the Paris Peace Conference the head of the Zionist delegation conceded that they had not been promised an independent state in the Levant, just the ability to settle Jewish people in the area.  In other words, the British promised the local inhabitants independence, and then turned around and started encouraging European Jews to settle there, so that they would not move to the UK, thereby solving what the British saw as the ""Jewish Problem"".  In the interwar period, the British set up ""Mandatory Palestine"", which it administered and controlled, while simultaneously providing independence to other areas under their control.  For example, Egypt was only a British protectorate from 1914-1922.  From WWI to the early 1930s, the British encouraged additional Jewish immigration to Palestine, even training and arming large Jewish militias that it later used to suppress the Palestinian revolt seeking independence from 1936-39, when, between the British military and their local trained and armed Jewish militias, more than 10% of the adult, male Palestinian population was either killed, injured, exiled or jailed.  Although their population had been decimated by the British and imported Jewish immigrants in the late 1930s, when WWII broke out, some local Palestinians reached out to the enemies of the occupying British forces, including Nazi Germany, but to no real effect, as they lacked the power or armaments to resist their occupiers and their militias so soon after the previous, brutal campaign, meaning that the Levant was, for all practical purposes, not involved in WWII, aside from being targeted by Italian bombers early in the war, and the formation of a ""Jewish Brigade"" from the Jewish fighters the British had trained and armed in the region.  Following the war, however, the British continued to encourage Jews from Europe to move to Mandate Palestine (again, because the y did not want Jews to move to the UK), greatly increasing the local Jewish population, though Jews maintained the minority ethnicity.  Then the local Jews started conducting terror attacks against British interests to try to drive them out, and since the British had so violently treated and abused the Palestinian population, they could not really look to use them against the Jews, so they washed their hands of the mess, and tried to make the UN hammer out a deal.  In 1947 the UN proposed that the minority Jewish population be given a majority of Palestine for an independent state, with the Palestinian population to receive a smaller portion, and Jerusalem to be an ""international city"" under neither groups' exclusive control.  Obviously, the Jewish population wholeheartedly agreed, seeing as they were being offered a much better deal than previous British commitments or even simple math would allow, and the Palestinians, and other Arab countries, rejected the proposal as unfair and unacceptable.  In anticipation of the British unilaterally withdrawing their forces, those local Jewish militias began ethnically cleansing the areas that they wanted to make part of a Jewish-majority state, and the indigenous population attempted to prevent the cleansing, though, again, with their decimated population and inferior equipment (and being mostly just civilians trying to live their lives) not very effectively.  Then, the British Mandate ended, the next day the Jewish population unilaterally declared a big chunk of land theirs, and in response, about 8-9,000 troops from various neighboring countries attempted to protect the rights of the indigenous population.  With far more troops, and prepared defensive positions, the Jewish population, now claiming Israeli citizenship, easily won the conflict, and ethnically cleansed significant additional areas, to what is now called the Green Line.  For the small percentage of Palestinians not cleansed from the new ""Israel"", the new state put them under martial law for a generation, from 1948 to 1966.  So no.  Britain didn't ""give"" Israel a state, but it did a lot to ensure that Israel could establish itself for an immigrant population the UK did not want to let into its own lands, despite the rights and interests of the indigenous population. Here's a brief explanation of the early history.  For context, and in interest of full disclosure, I tend to lean more towards Israel on defensive issues, but I am against the settlements:  After WWI, much of the Middle East came under UK and French control from Ottoman Turkey.  Treaties ending WWI gave the UK a mandate to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine.  There were already some Jews there, but Arabs were by far the majority.  Jews and Jewish organizations began purchasing land in the area from the prior owners (many of whom were absentee landlords), and more Jews started moving to Palestine.  There were attempts to make deals that would accommodate an Arab state and a Jewish state, like [this one](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaisalWeizmann_Agreement), but none were ever implemented.   In the meantime, there were Arab revolts against the growin Jewish population, particularly in 1920, 1929, and 1936-39.  In response to the 1936-39 riots, the British restricted further Jewish immigration to Palestine.  By this point Jews were about 1/3 of the population of Palestine.  After WWII, the British continued to forbid Jewish immigration. Fighting between the Jews and Arabs picked up in 1947, and there was almost a three-way fight between Jews, Arabs, and the U.K.    Eventually, the U.K. Said ""fuck it, we're leaving in May 1948.  UN, you decide what to do with this mandate.  The UN voted to divide the land into two countries - one Jewish, one Arab - with Jerusalem being a separate free city.  The U.K. Abstained from the vote.  The Jews accepted the partition (or the main body did), but the Arabs rejected it.  The fighting between Jews and Palestinian Arabs increased.  On May 14, 1948, Israel declared independence.  The surrounding Arab countries all declared war on Israel.  Israel mostly won the war and controlled more land than the original UN resolution when an armistice was made.  Jordan and Egypt annexed the West Bank and Gaza, respectively.  In 1967, Egypt blockaded the strait leading to southern Israel, expelled UN peacekeepers on the Egypt-Israel border, and mobilized its army, moving them to the border.  Israel attacked the Egyptian army and pushed them back across the Sinai peninsula. Jordan and Syria declared war on Israel, and Israel pushed the Jordanians across the Jordan River.  So at the end of the war, Israel controlled the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and Sinai peninsula.  Israel annexed East Jerusalem, but did not formally annex the rest.  In the 1970s (IIRC), Israel began building settlements in the West Bank.  There are now hundreds of thousands of Israelis living in the West Bank. Most of them live close to the border, near Jerusalem or the skinny neck part of Israel, but some are further out in the West Bank.  Israel regards some of the further out ones as illegal (under its law), including the one being evacuated, and the vast majority of the world regards all the settlements as being illegal.  There are many more levels of detail, but this is a *very basic* summary. well of course, people of Arabic decent are Semitic people as well.  so by definition.... in 2006?  Seriously you haven't been reading the news I guess. As soon as Netanyahu stepped in office, he halted all settlement construction and every few months signed a freezing order on all approved government construction plans beyond the green line.   During his term, the only construction conducted in the West Bank in relation to settlements was privately by Israeli citizens, whom he cannot, by law, prevent from building inside Israeli administered areas (at least, if he cared about not getting sued by thousands). No, it is more likely that Palestinians would be emboldened by the US stepping back from funding the Israeli military and attack more. This would make land *more* important to hold for Israel, as they want attacks kept as far from Israel as possible.  Peace is the main Israeli demand, a demand for which they have traded land before. You know that these settlers are Jewish right? Who would downvote this? https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/31/israel-west-bank-settlement-homes Always pushing your agenda.  Price tag  >Price tag policy (Hebrew:   ), also known as ""Mutual Responsibility"" (Arvut Hadadit),[1] is the name originally[2][3] given to acts of vandalism by Jewish fundamentalist settler youths,[4] aimed at the Palestinian population, Christians, left-wing Israeli Jews,[5] ArabIsraelis, and the Israeli security forces.  It's vandalism, not violence.  and Vandalism  >Vandalism is ""action involving deliberate destruction of or damage to public or private property"".[1] >The term includes criminal damage such as graffiti and defacement directed towards any property without permission of the owner.   Also, not violence.   I noticed that palestinian on Israeli violence is conspicuously missing from your post. How interesting. Sooooo... are all those down-votes an indication that people DO want there to be violence? Israel withdrew settlements and military bases from the Sinai penninsula, returning that land to Egypt in exchange for a peace treaty. Israel also withdrew settlements and military bases from Gaza, giving the Palestinian Authority control of that land. Unfortunately, the PA lost control to the militant Islamist group, Hamas.  So Israel is willing to withdraw settlements from the West Bank. They just want to be sure that it works out to be decades of peace, like with Egypt, and not further wars and skirmishes, like with Gaza. A grim reminder that it doesn't matter that there are more landmass than enough for all to settle, but religious and ethnic backward-mindedness, hate-think and revanche-culture continues to stifle the march for peace. How does that matter?  So, your ""answer"" is that the people removed from the land they lived on were waving the ""wrong"" flag?  Ffs. The long-winded complicated legal debate goes back to Ottoman era land claims. Thats 2 governments ago. > Most of the building today is done in areas that are already agreed to be swapped for other land   I'm pretty sure that's not true. I mean the PA has agreed to the principle of limited land swaps, but I'm pretty sure there's never been any actual agreement regarding any specific pieces of land, Ariel or otherwise. Actually, since Netanyahu took over most of the new construction has taken place [East of the Separation Barrier](http://peacenow.org/images/Summary%20of%20the%204%20years%20of%20Netanyahu%20Government.pdf), outside the main settlement blocks.  > Most of the building today is done in areas that are already agreed to be swapped for other land (think of this every time you hear a condemnation of an approval of housing units in settlements).  This could not be any further from the truth. Its a complete lie. Many many of these settlements are very far from the Green Line. This Amona settlement is going to be evacuated and relocated to a settlement so deep within Palestine that its going to be closer to Jordan than to Israel. What you said here about these settlers going to settlements that will be part of land swaps is a pure unadulterated lie.   > No one in their right minds will think of moving everyone in Ariel behind the green line, for exmaple. So there's absolutely no reason not to build further.  Ariel is an extremely controversial settlement because its so deep within Palestine and will make it very difficult for Paletine to be viable. Thats why Palestinians have proposed that they annex Ariel and/or Maale Adumim and make the settlers there Palestinian citizens. It is absolutely not anywhere close to settled that Israel will annex Ariel. > demilitarized Palestinian nation-type entity  It's called a Bantustan. > Most of the building today is done in areas that are already agreed to be swapped for other land  FALSE.  First, there is no agreement to a single inch of Occupied Palestinian Territory becoming part of Israel.  The PA (and the countries that proposed the Arab Peace Initiative) have agreed, IN PRINCIPLE to land swaps of equal size and quality across the Green Line, but unless and until an agreement on precise territorial exchanges is entered, there is NO AGREEMENT that a single square inch will be transferred to Israel.  Furthermore, Israel is unwilling to agree to that formula, as evidenced by the fact that Israel has never made an offer of equal territory for the lands it wants to gain, even in quantity, let alone quality.  In short, while the Palestinians have agreed in principle to land swaps, no specific land swaps have been agreed to, and Israel has not agreed to that principle.  > No one in their right minds will think of moving everyone in Ariel behind the green line, for example.  And no one in their right minds would ever think that Ariel would become part of Israel in any peace agreement.  It is, literally, a deal-breaker. >  that are already agreed to be swapped for other lan  Sorry homie, was there an agreement that only you know about? This thing was never agreed.   >No one in their right minds will think of moving everyone in Ariel   Speak for yourself. Actually if Ariel ~~state~~ stays then forget about having a contiguous Palestinian state. And in all the failed talks, Ariel was going to go.    > wants to annex Area C (where the vast majority of settlers live)   All the settlers live in Area C. Areas B and A, which contain more than 95% of Palestinians in the West Bank, are off limits to Israeli citizens by Israeli law.  In the 90's Israel demanded 9% of the west bank in exchange for a 1% land swap. The instance where israel was talking of only stealing 5% of the palestinian territories was during the Olmert deal, which was a verbal-only offer where Olmert refused to allow Abbas to have a copy of the map or make any adjustments whatsoever. Most people blame Olmert for the failure of the talks, not that he should be blamed necesssarily because he had a very strict time limit (he was about to be hauled off to jail for corruption charges). Israel isnt close to only demanding 5% of the west bank today.  And will continue saying that, until their holy conquest is complete. What war are you talking about? The one in 1967 where there were troops amassed on Israel's border, and without which there would be no potential for a Palestine now (as it would still be Jordan)? They had a casus belli and their military tech was a level ahead! What would you have done, mothball all your forts and focus on embracing ideas? Yeah right!  edit: This was an EU4 reference, sponsored by public viewers like you. And brought to you by the letter ""h."" Your stupid rhetoric hurts your cause. Every ""justified"" stabing of a jew gives them another settlement. Fanning the flames will only end badly for the side that has rocks against tanks. > The settlement is ""illegal"" even under Israeli law   Just a bit more accurate.   wait doesnt the US support them? I thought that was something we did that a lot of people didnt like (im honestly asking this, I dont know) > They are moving them to new settlements  The article isn't saying that. [Citation Needed] why does the UN laser focus on israel so much when there is much worse human rights violations going on in the world?  yea yea whataboutism and all that but you need to pick your battles and you arent going to win in this situation and all it does is reveal UN bias > Israel's distinctions between 'legal' and 'illegal' settlements aren't accepted by anyone outside of Israel.  I accept them. Many independent legal scholars accept them. What you mean to say is that no countries have been willing to make sacrifices in order to stand up for whats right, because the Arabs are powerful and pissing them off is too costly for Israel to justify. > occupied Palestinian Territories  This is a misnomer. The land is disputed territory, not occupied. In order for it to be occupied, it would have had to have been part of the sovereign nation being occupied at some point in history. There never was any country called palestine. The entire concept of palestinian identity is less than 100 years old. This is land disputed between Israel and Jordan following the end of the British Mandate. I am certain of this for the very wimple reason that from 1948-1967 it was under control of Jordan, who never once tried to turn it into a new country called Palestine. Pretending that it is an occupied independent state simply because the other disputant gained control over the territory is just idiotic. When the Mandate ended, Jordan and Israel both claimed the territory as their own, making it disputed territory. In 1967, control of the disputed territory changed hands, but that doesn't make it occupied. I wish people would stop eating up the propaganda lies that have been told about this conflict for decades.   >illegal under international law  Once we recognize that the land is not occupied, we can also accept that there is nothing illegal about Israelis living there, especially when you consider that those territories had numerous Jewish settlements which were ethnically cleansed in 1948, some of which were hundreds of years old. Long story short you are buying into the false propaganda being told and you are very very wrong. The law is a moral mechanism. Things that are illegal are thought of as morally wrong, though at times they can be less morally wrong than things that are legal.   Being gay used to be illegal in the US, and police would use sting operations to find homosexuals. What is legal and illegal is in flux  This is hardly any better. For example:  > the Amona outpost, which was built two decades ago on private Palestinian land.  Private Palestinian land according to whom? How does ""The Guardian"" know whose land it was? They're not citing their source: We are expected to make an appeal to authority, ""It's true because 'the Guardian' says so."" Appeals to human authority are fine if it doesn't really matter if we're wrong, but if it actually seriously matters, it's not sufficient.  Why do we praise the scientific method and academic scholarship as the vehicles of progress but then allow journalists to not cite their sources? Because uhhh...  we want it all? Besides, I'm sure that western liberals would rally the indigenous population of this island to fight this ""colonialist oppression"" that brought them electricity and running water, just for the fun of it. I mean if I was a European I'd too want to deflect from my ancestors colonialist crimes by trying to focus attention on other people with bright skin having good lives while their darker neighbors suffer in poverty. It's natural to fight your dark past by picking on someone weak. By combating expansion. Because it gives actual specific Palestinians their private land back.   Moving them to a settlement that *doesn't* lie on private land, and doesn't take away land from any private owner, doesn't somehow negate that. Israeli military and police don't enforce international law, they enforce Israeli law. It was proven in an Israeli court that part of Amona is on private Arab land, that's why police are removing the settlers. These lawsuits usually base their claims on weird Ottoman laws and dubious Jordanian ownership papers so usually they lose. But given enough money for good lawyers, subsidized by EU, they do win sometimes.  I'm all for enforcing the law, but also on Arabs that build illegally, which is why I wonder where were you 2 weeks ago when an Israeli policeman was murdered by an Israeli Arab for enforcing similar court order. Anyway this litigation nonsense is done only to stall the peace process, the territories and borders should be negotiated, not set by a court.  I never implied anyone was getting paid, I just thought people were butt-hurt because they think criticizing a country is somehow equal to criticizing them as people or as a race. However, as /u/Qksiu pointed out some, apparently, *are* getting paid to be keyboard warriors. It's not payment. It's about working in packs, posting the same statements..etc.  If you really that I'm a shill for believing something different than you, then you are delusional.  I'd heard rumors, but I've honestly never read a news article about it before. Holy shit....I've heard rumors and conspiracies about that kind of thing but it was mostly American media talking about Russians doing this kind of thing. Do you think that this doesn't happen elsewhere?   In America it's called 'Patriotism' Israel made no step. These settlers are being moved to equally illegal settlements.  > England split Palestine into Israeli and palestinian sections.  ""palestine"" ok. For some reason I thought the partition plan's original idea was to have two states, but for some reason, the plan fell through and only created israel. I would say that is a faulty argument. Semitic might define Arab, Jews, Assyrians, and about anyone who speaks a semitic language. Problem is with that argument is that anti-semitism was a term developed specifically in regards to Jews. It doesnt matter what the legitimate meaning of a word maybe, but rather how it has been used.   That being said, the Israel debate is irrelevant to the linguistics of the word anti-Semitic.  lol no, by ""definition"" antisemitism solely refers to hatred against Jews.   Netanyahu specifically did not ever stop settlement expansion for a single moment. The 'freeze' you are talking about was only ever recognized by Israel. The USA and Europe unanimously said that Israel was continuing to illegally expand settlements across east Jerusalem during the freeze, and they blamed the failure of peace talks squarely on Israel.  Please let this be sarcasm.......No one can be this delusional omg who the fuck are you fooling, you must really live in a bubble, this military aggression happens every quarter. > in 2006  BCE?  By the Jewish Calendar?  That's certainly not true about 2006 CE. And therefore the indigenous people Morons I assume.  > Always pushing your agenda.  If you mean advocating for human rights and against violence, then yes.  Pushing that agenda.  As for your claim that the thousands of ""price tag"" attacks over the last decade are all non-violent vandalism, you are fucking lying.  > This is a list of attacks reported or suspected price tag (Hebrew:   ) attacks or violence aimed at the Palestinian population and at Israeli security forces[1] by radical Israeli settlers, who, according to The New York Times, ""exact a price from local Palestinians or from the Israeli security forces for any action taken against their settlement enterprise"".  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Israeli_price_tag_attacks  And further:  4 December 2008:  ""three Palestinians, including a father and son, were wounded by gunfire, 12 others injured and 15 cars torched.""  1 June 2009:  ""Settlers ... stoned and assaulted Palestinian drivers trying to remove the debris, injuring 6""  20 July 2009:  ""two Palestinian motorists were injured, and six vehicles damaged near Nablus in an attack attributed by Palestinians to settlers from Yitzhar""  23 July 2009:  ""over 20 armed settlers from an outpost near Yitzhar entered the village of Asira al-Qibliya and hurled stones at the villagers. When the villagers responded with stones, Israeli security forces arrived, fired sound bombs and teargas at them, resulting in the injury of one Palestinian boy""  9 September 2009:  ""more than 10 settlers from the Israeli settlement of Susiya, went to the neighbouring Palestinian village of that name, hurled stones and physically assaulted the villagers, resulting in injuries to 15 members of a family, including 10 children.""  17 March 2011:  ""5 to 7 Jewish men, using a metal pipe and tear gas, assaulted two Palestinian labourers renovating a house on the edge of the settlement of Shiloh. A Jewish security guard protecting them was also injured slightly.""  14 November 2013:  ""A Palestinian home in the West Bank village of Sinjil was set alight, with 5 Palestinians suffering from smoke inhalation.""  23 November 2014: ""settlers, attacking with Molotov cocktails and stun grenades, torched the home of the widow of Abd al-Karim Hussein Hamayil in Khirbet Abu Falah""  31 July 2015:  ""18-month-old Ali Saad Dawabsha was killed, two houses burnt down and three family members, including a 4-year-old child, hospitalized with severe burns""  Moreover, with the even more instances of what you would characterize as mere ""vandalism"", you have people smashing windows of people's homes in the middle of the night, and terrorizing people simply for the being born to the wrong parents.  Even those acts have far too much similarity to Kristallnacht for my comfort.  I very disappointed you don't feel the same way.   More to the point, why are you opposed to my statement that I hope this doesn't lead to violence?  Why do you want it to lead to violence? Accusing Holihands of pushing an agenda, for wishing that the IDF and Palestinians aren't attacked. Then outright denying price tags are not violent.   http://www.timesofisrael.com/settlers-reportedly-attack-idf-soldiers-near-susiya/   > **Israeli military personnel** who arrived at the scene were reportedly **attacked by three settlers** who refused to leave the area  in violation of army orders barring Israelis from the area.  Defending Jewish extremists? Who has the agenda again?  *words Interesting how?  What ""palestinian [sic] on Israeli violence"" would YOU expect to result from the ISRAELI government enforcing the ruling of an ISRAELI COURT against ISRAELI SETTLERS?  We've all seen hundreds of attacks on Palestinian people and property by Israeli settlers when they feel that the Israeli government has not treated them the way they want to be treated, but the only role for Palestinians in the scenario at issue here would be as the targets of further victimization. There were 3,000 settlers in Sinai and 8,000 in Gaza. There are 800,000 in the west bank and east jerusalem. The inention from the start was to annex east jerusalem and judea and samaria, not gaza or the sinai. The peace treaties with egypt and jordan show that peace works. Israel has never agreed to a two state solution or peace treaty with the palestinians and continues to illegally expand settlements.  So they are building settlements so they have something to offer in a peace deal? Hard to take your comment seriously.  This is all bullshit. Israel withdrew from Gaza which they never could annex but they built more settlements in the West Bank also known as Judea and Samaria by Israelis who believe God gave them this land.   The current Israeli government is extremely pro-settlements and includes a Religious extremist party that wants to annex the entire West Bank step by step (starting with Area C). We paid them to leave the sinai because their aggression was destabilizing the world.   Jesus christ you're so full of bullshit.  Israel has said many many times that they believe that Palestine is THEIR land, and they'll do anything to ""get it back"" even though it wasn't theirs in the first place.  How you even have any upvotes is fucking terrifying. Thanks for the post this is very informative. As you mentioned in another post it's a challenge to get unbiased information on this subject. What would the counter argument to yours be? Why do you feel like your explanation is accurate?  You sound quite reasonable and informed so I hope you can help educate me and others a bit. No, my point is that it isn't Palestinian land, because Palestine never existed.  If you really cared you would be angry about the Palestinians in Jordan that still live in refugee camps since the Hashemite rulers from Hejaz were given control over the region.  But let's be real, create a Palestinian state, guess what would happen? Jordan and Egypt would invade it and take back that land. No neighboring country of Israel wants there to be a Palestine, they all want the land for themselves.  The basic framework laid by previous negotiations is not going to be ignored in future negotiations, and to think otherwise is disingenuous at best. TIL most is 38%. Ariel is behind the separation wall.. How can it be untenable to live with it being on the Israeli side of the border, when effectively, it already is?   Maale Edumim is adjacent to Jerusalem, and is also behind the wall... That's not the heart of the West Bank.  [Here's a map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Barrier_route_July_2011.png), figured you'll need it. Or, you know, a time-limited demilitarization of a state that has already proven its thirst for blood. Kind of like post-war Germany. Or was Germany also a type of bantustan? Well, Hebron is Area A but there are settlers there. There is a big issue with those %, because the definition of what is West Bank is different between Israel and Palestine. Also % doesn't mean anything at all, since the value of land is different. Many Israeli settlements are build on very good land, so Israel giving them just any land in exchange would be a loss for the Palestinians. > stealing 5% of the palestinian territories  ""Stealing"" from whom? And why does it belong to them in the first place?  > Olmert refused to allow Abbas to have a copy of the map  Of course, because Abbas had (and still has) a habit of disappearing. Olmert knew that Abbas could take the map and not return to him. Then he would use the map as a bargaining chip in the talks with the future PM of Israel.  > or make any adjustments whatsoever  Lie. He was open to hear any Abbas thoughts on the offer.  > Most people blame Olmert  You and your radical leftist friends? Yes, but I doubt this is ""most of the people"". You guys will always find a way to blame the Israeli PM for everything.  Abbas disappeared the next day. He didn't even try to meet with Olmert again. He was literally given the best offer ever, and instead of organizing (at least) some further meetings he flew to Amman and didn't answer calls. There's troops on poland's borders, can we bomb russia then?   Paradox subs seem to leak way too much for the relative population of game players More accurate? The one that ordered the demolishion was the Israeli supreme court! The US has consistently been against the settlements, in rhetoric, though it does nothing to actually stop them.  Israel was very upset recently because the US didn't veto a UNSC resolution criticizing the settlements (though the resolution had no actual enforcement mechanisms, and also criticized Palestinian 'incitement').  It was the first resolution of Obama's tenure regarding Israel that he hadn't had vetoed, and every other American President since at least Carter has allowed UNSC resolutions critical of the settlement enterprise pass, but somehow that was some sort of 'betrayal'. Up until trump every us administration has opposed settlements. Trump says he will change that and make the US be first country in history to not oppose settlements but the state departments policy hasn't actually changed yet.  See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5q4vcg/palestinians_say_obamas_lastminute_221_million/dcwd4vl/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=frontpage) It's the first link in the article  http://m.dw.com/en/west-bank-amona-outpost-residents-accept-relocation-deal/a-36818944 There are other problems but they are being largely dealt with in some way. The world is bombing Isis, sanctioning North Korea to death, sanctioned Iran into agreeing the nuclear deal, isolating Myanmar until they accepted democracy, etc. Israel is one of the few places where the world  does nothing. The UN makes noise to try to shame Israel into stopping its criminal behavior but they consistently fail to take any material action against Israel. That's why Israel gets away with it.  Israel's conflict is the oldest and allowing it to continue normalizes conquest which is explicitly banned by b the UN charter.  Maybe, just maybe because the UN is responsible for the existence of Israel.  The UN focuses on all of them. However there are REPERCUSSIONS for those breeches of human rights that Israel is immune to. So the focus is more ""interesting"".   No one's consistently broken the law as much as Israel and protected from the repercussions of it.   So let's take Indonesia and East Timor peacekeepers showed up to stop the genocide. There are peace keepers in places like the DRC too. People are arrested and tried in human rights courts.   Israel has avoided that.   Tell me?   What's the level of acceptable protest that an occupied people are allowed? Considering the West Bank is occupied by Israeli forces.   What should Palestinians do? Live on as second class citizens in an occupied territory where their land can be seized at whim? Or fight back? What's the acceptable level they should fight back at?   Because I guarantee you that people have fought at that level and not achieved anything because the USA protected Israel from the International backlash that comes with torturing people. bulldozing their houses and suspending due process.  No, it means all states agree with the ICJ's and the Red Cross's interpretation of the Fourth Geneva convention which prevents the colonization of occupied territory as a flagrant violation of the occupied population's rights. A handful of partisan scholars holding contrarian views are quite meaningless. There is always a contrarian fringe in every issue, even in those where consensus is overwhelming like this one.  ""What you mean to say is that no countries have been willing to make sacrifices in order to stand up for whats right""  This might have something to do with those countries rationale:  ""Art. 49. Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive.  ...  The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.""  4th Geneva Convention, 12 August 1949 How exactly is it 'right' for Israel to settle occupied territory? Is it just because they are Jewish and therefore have a right to Palestinian land? Seems like pure unadulterated racism.  > because the Israelis are powerful  FTFY I may detect a twinge of racism here  > This is a misnomer. The land is disputed territory, not occupied.   No country in the world considers this territory disputed. It's disputed like Poland was disputed after the Nazi invasion. The security council specifically calls Israel the occupier, calls the land the Palestinian Territories, and calls on Israel to withdraw.   > In order for it to be occupied, it would have had to have been part of the sovereign nation being occupied at some point in history. There never was any country called palestine. The entire concept of palestinian identity is less than 100 years old. This is land disputed between Israel and Jordan following the end of the British Mandate.  It was taken from Jordan in 1967. Jordan gave all Palestinians citizenship. Israel militarily occupies them while denying them citizenship. In 1988 King Hussein made Palestine an independent Palestinian state, dividing the state of Jordan into two. That's when it became Palestinian rather than Jordanian.  The age of Palestinian identity is wholly irrelevant. Most middle eastern and African national identities were created very recently around the same time from 1850-1950 during and after colonization/decolonization, prior to which these lands were part of multi-national empires.     > I am certain of this for the very wimple reason that from 1948-1967 it was under control of Jordan, who never once tried to turn it into a new country called Palestine.  Hey have them all Jordanian citizenship. It's irrelevant whether it's independent or part of Jordan, the people weren't stateless and militarily occupied.   > Pretending that it is an occupied independent state simply because the other disputant gained control over the territory is just idiotic.  It's not an occupied state, it's an occupied territory. No country or international law disagree with his outside Israel.   > When the Mandate ended, Jordan and Israel both claimed the territory as their own, making it disputed territory.  Israel never claimed the West Bank. Israel claimed Israel. I have no clue what history you read. The expansionist aims came after 1967, to the horror of the founding father of Israel, Ben Gurion, who opposed any and all expansionism beyond the 1967 borders.    > In 1967, control of the disputed territory changed hands, but that doesn't make it occupied. I wish people would stop eating up the propaganda lies that have been told about this conflict for decades.   It was Jordanian prior to 1967. Some people wanted it to be Palestinian, like most Arab neighbors and the PLO, but that was the only controversy. There was no 'dispute' whatsoever with Israel. Israel took control in 1967 and systematically denied citizenship and rights to the people living there. It's undeniably occupied by all definitions.   > The land is disputed territory, not occupied.  No, under international law, the land is occupied. ""Disputed"" means that the borders have not been identified by international law. In this case, international law clearly recognizes the borders of Israel and this falls outside those borders. Ergo, this is an occupation. Israel might dispute those borders because they want to take possession of said land, but that's an internal issue for Israel, not an issue per international law. International law of very clear on this and Israel is in the wrong (for the umpteenth time). Thats a bit of a weak argument... because the people living there did not form what we consider a nation (but had homes, villages, families, communities), they are not able to share the rights we consider to be fair?  Im far from an anti-Israeli/anti-Semite or even always pro-Palestinian (i pity them in many ways but their tendency to indiscriminate violence is their biggest enemy) but Israel is these days ultra-realpolitik in their calculations. As long as the iron dome and IDF serve to neuter the cost of continued conflict without reducing the benefifs (that is to say,  they get to justify their own actions as a response to violence without actuallh suffering anywhere near equal costs) they have no incentive to peace.  Same thing in Turkey. Why would Gollum WANT to end the Kurdish resistance when it has been a free pass to make himself ever more powerful? There was no state of Israel either until land that Palestinians called home was given to them. disputed by the people that are using the military to take it - but go on, lets see how this plays out for the people under the bulldozers. > There never was any country called palestine.  [Roman Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria_Palaestina)  [Palaestina Prima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaestina_Prima)  [Jund Filistin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jund_Filastin)   [The British Mandate of Palestine.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Mandate_for_Palestine_(legal_instrument)  It's almost like it's Israel that was just created less than 100 years ago. > The land is disputed territory, not occupied. In order for it to be occupied, it would have had to have been part of the sovereign nation being occupied at some point in history. There never was any country called palestine  Okay, so because you deny it exists, it isn't a country. Then there isn't a country called Israel.  I have to give it to this author for supreme abstraction and obfuscation of a point.  This is why we can't argue with you. ""Gee, just accept that the 1967 invasion never happened, and then poof, no problem!""   talk about alternative facts... thats how the orders from the Pope allowed explores to 'claim land in the name of......."".  The rational was noone was really using it, no of improtance, no matter how many eons they were there Nice formative and succinct. http://www.thekeyofknowledge.net/General/N_Palestine.html True but this is obviously wrong in both senses.  Private Palestinian land according to the Israeli courts. They ruled that the settlers had forged the documents that they used to show that they had purchased the land.  Because when it comes to political matters, we want to believe what we already believe, and look for evidence that supports our existing positions while disregarding that which does not. When your only argument is to deny the exstence of objective truth you have lost.  Do they have records/land titles/deeds there? (serious question)   The Guardian is actually a reputable British newspaper. [removed] It's equally illegal. International law doesn't distinguish between state land and private land in the occupied territories. 100% of settlement of the occupied territories is illegal under the Fourth Geneva Conventions. Only Israel makes this distinction.  > I never implied anyone was getting paid  but you said  > Holy shit the Israel Online Defense academy or some shit is a lose on reddit. What the fuck. I'm not saying you're a shill at all, that part of my comment was more related to the humorous ""Israel Online Defense academy"" that the above person mentioned, considering I rarely ever see any post or comment from you on /r/worldnews that is not about painting Israel in a good or Palestine in a bad way. Is this like reporting squatters in your bathroom, and the police evict them to your kitchen, then you are supposed to make peace because they aren't in your bathroom anymore? Israel isn't moving them anywhere except ""out of Amona."" In this case, shorthand for ""the British mandate of Palestine."" Not the country Palestine, as that never existed before modern times. I do agree with the Thomas Theorem: ""If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences.""   If a person is walking through the desert and sees a mirage of an oasis, they will likely run toward it.  But that doesn't mean that there is an oasis there, merely that his actions can be dictated by his beliefs. On the contrary, the Israel debate is intrinsic to the term, for example, the nation of Israel exists because the world agreed that they had the right of return, to come home after the hundreds, and in some cases thousands of years.  But the international community, mostly the USA, has stood behind the Israeli's in their denial of that same right to those displaced in just the last decades.  We are all human, and should all be seen as such. They criticized Israel when in fact it was the Jerusalem municipality's decision to build within its territories. As you may not know, it is Jerusalem's Mayor's right to order construction within every inch of the municipality.   Also the mayors of Ma'ale Adumim and Ariel have also announced construction plans to expand their blocks.  However all such requests were in the end blocked.  The UN was barking at Israel when these plans were frozen anyway and haven't materialized for at least a dozen years now. no I just checked the facts. Netanyahu froze settlement building in exchange for diplomatic assistance from Obama administration.  The previous president, Ariel Sharon, to whom Netanyahu vehemently opposed, was not called ""father of the settlements"" for no reason.  BCE refers to Jesus Christ's approximate birth date as a reference point. 2006 BCE was 4000 years ago.  The Jewish Calendar's year 2006 was 3700 years ago. A 300 year difference.  Jesus Christ is insignificant in Jewish history and isn't marked as reference point on the Jewish calendar.  So you're an idiot by both accounts.    And how are dating systems related to the topic at hand? Jewish people have been out of control of the land for more than 1,000 years. The Arabs controled that land when many of our grandparents were alive.   Who has more say over a piece of land?   Some say, might makes right, meaning the ones who now have military supremacy own it. Some say that those who once controlled it more than one thousand years ago and have religious scripture backing their claim deserve it. Some say those who have lived there for last 1,000+ years previous to the relatively recent foreign orchestrated division deserve it.  The might makes right camp says that if you're American, you need to shut up, because America screwed the native Americans within the last few hundred years. It was truly a detestable set of behavior and makes Americans look like hypocrites for complaining about Israel doing similar, perhaps even more tame, things in 2017.  I think that public opinion and public backlash have adapted to new technologies that allow for rapid communication and video of injustices going on. As a result, people care more and do more to stop the injustices. Perhaps the native Americans wouldn't have been treated so poorly if there was video and the Internet at that time. Transparency helps to prevent unscrupulous self-serving people from doing what they do. They are more likely to get consequences and in seeking to avoid consequences, more often choose to behave.   The thing is, we define ourselves by how we believe and act. Our beliefs are like a protocol for our behavior. If we say something is or is not acceptable, we define ourselves to be those that would or wouldn't do whatever that is. In the past, we may have done it. Yet, we are always changing with new information and perspectives. We shouldn't let a checkered past compel us to choose to create a checkered future.   We can affect how ugly or beautiful our future becomes in this way. The experience of compassion and cooperation as well as the experience of cold, calculating, compassionless competition each have a momentum that causes people to either be more likely to choose to cooperate or compete, to love each other or fear each other. We each pull for these behavior patterns in differing amounts that coexist in a dynamic flux. It's one huge system that feeds back into itself. What we put into it matters a lot.  There's violence against Palestinians.  And there's price tag. Which is vandalism.  Those two are different things, and they don't happen because of A settlement being evacuated.  So who's lying here?  Maybe you haven't seen the word   >reported or suspected price tag (Hebrew:   ) attacks **or** violence aimed at the Palestinian population.  Different things. Again, what you're saying is this:  Settlers attacking Israeli military = Settler violence.  Price Tag = Vandalism.  Two different things.  One is settler violence, against Palestinians or IDF.  Other is settlers defacing property, arson and destroying property.  What you linked is attack on Israeli soldiers by settlers, there is no connection to price tag other than the military police were there to investigate settlers related to graffiti. Aren't these settlers being relocated to other settlements? You don't think anything could happen? The ""peace treaty"" worked out at Camp David pretty much amounts to the US paying $3B per year to Egypt in danegeld.  Probably cheaper in the long run than perpetual war in the region, but it's not peace.  Israel has accepted a 2-state solution. About a dozen times a peace treaty involving FULL withdrawal to the 1949 armistice lines was offered by Israel, and every time it was rejected by the Palestinians over very minor details, such as where a certain road will go.  > Israel has never agreed to a two state solution or peace treaty with the palestinians and continues to illegally expand settlements.  They agreed with reluctance to the Peel Commision, with reservations at Camp David, and proposed a plan in 2008. At least try to hold the Palestinians to some semblance of autonomous agency. > There are 800,000 in the west bank and east jerusalem  Funny how you call Jews living in Jerusalem ""settlers"". [This is a great book](https://www.amazon.com/Other-Arab-Israeli-Conflict-Americas-Monograph/dp/0226769623) that looks at US policy making in Israel/palestine but in so doing discusses the positions, actions, and methods of both Israel and Palestine from a fresh perspective.   That coupled with [this survey of the conflict's history](https://www.amazon.com/History-Arab-Israeli-Conflict-Ian-Bickerton/dp/0205968139/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_3?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=2FRZE7WC8QP65MMGTP18), will set you up with a really nice basis of info from academic, professional sources.  You'll notice they both term it the Arab-Israeli conflict, not Palestinian, because the context, and the conflict really exist on a pan-Arab level.   In terms of other comments counseling internet sources -- it's a waste of time. There is no such thing as methodology, professional ethics, training, accurate citation, foreign service experience, etc. on reddit or wiki, and that's what reading real academic books gives you. If you go lurk in /r/israel, /r/palestine, or anything else starting from /r/ you're just going to get a more and more warped view.     The first step is to understand there is no non-biased version because whatever middle ground you take people will cry you are being a hypocrite. Source: Reddit :(  On a more serious note, wiki can be great to quickly gather facts you might be missing. For the overall perspective you can always come post in /r/israel (or lurk for awhile, like I shamelessly did in /r/iran). There isn't a unbaised version.  Every little thing is disputed.  But there are great historians that taken together offer a much better picture.  A lot of research is new as things are declassified in Israel.  A historian like Benny Morris is a good place to start. It is really hard to get an unbiased version.  I think the important thing to remember though is that it isn't a Palestinian-Israeli conflict, it is an Arab-Israeli conflict. It isn't about antisemitism in the Middle East, it is about xenophobia in the Middle East.  Arab states oppose the creation of a Kurdish state. The Gulf States are fueling Sunni Muslim insurgency against Assad's Syrian government not for political or religious reasons. It is because Assad and his Alawite minority are ruling the Syrian state.  So Israel, a Jewish state, was opposed by the Arab states in 1948 because they felt that the Middle East, Arabia, belongs to the Arab Sunni majority. It is the same in Lebanon. The Lebanese Christian Arabs used to control the Lebanese state but that is an unacceptable situation. Ethnic and religious identities battle it out in Lebanon as they do in Syria, as they do in Iraq and Yemen, as they do in Israel and Palestine.  That is not to say the region is hopeless. But if you grew up in the region, you know what I'm talking about. It is a wonderful place, an ancient cradle of civilization, but it is deeply troubled. The Iron Wall by Avi Schlaim. It's a hefty read, and it was published in 2000 so the past few years are missing. But it's a great look into how the region ended up in this situation. I considered the author to be pretty unbiased, and he makes it easy (imo) to form your own opinions about the actions of both sides Take a trip across the wall and question everything.   Read all of the documents you can get your hands on, question those too.   People like taking sides and they also like being on the right side. That is a very hard thing to judge in this case.  Where in the ""middle east"" did you grow up? You really need to understand the Jewish religious idea of Zion, Zionism, and then secular Zionism, then the creation of Israel to get a big picture. [A wall in Palestine, by Rene Backmann](http://us.macmillan.com/awallinpalestine/renebackmann/9780312427818/) it's a few years old, but it's a good read  You don't understand Middle Eastern politics.  If Israel retreats from land, the Arab states will see that as weakness. Israel has every reason to show its strength. After all, it has had to protect its existent in wars 1948, 1967,1973, and continually since.  Telling Israel: ""Don't worry. Your neighbors are done trying to destroy you.""  Israel has been attacked by every neighbor for over a century. It is madness to expect Israel to lay down their arms. Their arms have kept them safe for over a century.  Tell Hamas to lay down their arms. Tell the Palestian Authority to lay down their arms. If the Arabs would lay down their arms, there would be peace.  If the Jews of Israel put down their arms, they'd be slaughtered. > also known as Judea and Samaria by Israelis who believe God gave them this land  I'm tired of hearing this bullshit already. Most of the Israelis use this historical name and it has nothing to do with religion.  > includes a Religious extremist party that wants to annex the entire West Bank step by step (starting with Area C)  Lie. The Jewish home party (labeled extremist only by radical leftists like you) wants to annex only area C (where the majority of the Israelis reside) and to leave areas A and B for Arab self-government.  It's called Judea and Samaria because that was the region's name before the Romans came and kicked the natives (which included ancient Jews) out, renaming it Palestine in the process. > Israel has said many many times  It's not a monolith, but rather a diverse society with lively internal debate.  Though the Jewish consensus in 1947 was to divide and share the land, the Arabs chose war. That makes sense, because the Arabs should have won. But the Jews pulled off the upset and get to live.  Israel gave up land for peace many times. Israel has been trying to trade the Golan Heights to Syria for decades in exchange for a peace treaty, but they refuse.  Along with examples like returning Sinai for peace (Sinai is the size of the entire rest of Israel), it is hard to say Israel is expansionist. The counter argument is that Israel only had 3,000 settlers in Sinai and 8,000 in Gaza. It currently has 800,000 in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. The idea that ""Israel can just remove them when the Palestinians are ready for peace"" is pure propaganda. These settlers were never leave and Israel has never planned on ever removing them. Sinai and Gaza were never going to be annexed, East Jerusalem and the West Bank were always going to be annexed. The reason why Israel has peace with Jordan and Egypt is because Israel doesn't want those territories. The reason why there is no peace with Palestine is because Israel wants the Palestinian territories and it won't even pause settlement expansion even in the face of universal international condemnation.  Arguing as if that basic framework of limited land swaps leaves ""absolutely no reason not to build further"" on whatever land Israel might hope to keep under a future agreement is flagrantly dishonest. Plus 29.5% between the actually built fence and the planned route of the fence. Only 32.3% are West of the barrier.  > Ariel is behind the separation wall.. How can it be untenable to live with it being on the Israeli side of the border, when effectively, it already is?   What? The separation wall is NOT the border. The 'separation wall' cuts through 10% of the West Bank, and is entirely illegal. It is not at all on the Israeli border. The separation wall separates parts of the Palestinian Territories from each other. That's why so many people oppose it. Ariel is deep, deep within the West Bank. Look at your map. You apparently did look at it or didn't understand it. That line inside the West Bank is not the border at all in any sense. The border is the line on the western side, not the dotted lines.    > Maale Edumim is adjacent to Jerusalem, and is also behind the wall... That's not the heart of the West Bank.  Adjacent to east Jerusalem, and cuts off direct access for much of the West Bank to East Jerusalem, the capital of the future Palestinian state. Imagine if Palestine demanded the annexation of a Palestinian settlement on the other side of West Jerusalem.  Germany was a viable contigous stare with ZERO FUCKING SETTLERS. Obviously, in any final deal the land swapped across the Green Line would have to be equal not only in size, but also in quality.  You are right, however, that to date Israel has not offered land that meets either criteria. We only hear about the bad things Israel is doing because if the media treated Palestine the same way, Palestine would be in the news every week Are they lobbing artillery shells at civilians? Because that is what Syria and Jordan were doing. Maybe something similar to how Egypt was attacking Israeli civilian ships in the international Red Sea?  Israel only started the 1967 war if Israel was expected to endure continued attacks on its civilians. Egypt even expelled UN peacekeepers from the borders and replaced them with armored units from the Egyptian army (hint: armored units are for attack). I think he may be referring to the Israeli tendency to retroactively grant legal status to outposts that were originally constructed without permits. > The US has consistently been against the settlements, in rhetoric  Not anymore. >As part of the new agreement, the government promised to build 52 homes and public buildings for them at two nearby locations.  Depends on where those are, then. Bullshit. Saudi Arabia is bombing thousands to tens of thousands of Yemenis to death while giving tactile assistance to AQAP, and starving 7.5 million Yemenis to death it what has been called by some NGOs the world largest potential silent genocide. We have a resurgent Taliban in Pakistan murdering secularists, we have active chaos in Venezuela, Somalia is still a basket case, allegations of genocide in Burma, etc.   But no the Arab league and Islamic coalition want to focus on Israel/Palestine because it distracts from their godawful actions, terror funding and brutual it's against their citizens.    Oh and that's ignoring the perpetual genocies and ethnic cleansing in central Africa.  >There are other problems but they are being largely dealt with in some way.   They really arn't. What about Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia and Crimea? Why the international community is silent on the ""illegal settlements"" there? > So let's take Indonesia and East Timor peacekeepers showed up to stop the genocide. There are peace keepers in places like the DRC too. People are arrested and tried in human rights courts.   >Israel has avoided that.   What? Israel has never committed genocide. The palestinian population have more than triplicated. This is not genocide. At all.  >What should Palestinians do? Live on as second class citizens in an occupied territory where their land can be seized at whim? Or fight back? What's the acceptable level they should fight back at?   palestinians living on the palestinian territories are not even citizens of Israel. And when Israel has offered them citizenship (like with Jerusalem), many have rejected it.   What Israel can do now? Force them? People would go mad. So when they leave them like that, people still go mad.   You cannot win fanatics.  oh i dont know move to one of the many muslim majority countries that could accept them? although i guess the jews could also go and move to another jewish majority country  oh wait there isnt one This doesn't apply because Jordan no longer claims the West Bank. Claims on the land from Palestinian organizations like Fatah and Hamas aren't retroactive. The West Bank wasn't conquered from them, because they never controlled it. The technical reason is that the West Bank was never a country or recognized as part of a country, so its borders are undetermined. After the end of the British Mandate of Palestine, the Kingdom of Jordan (then Transjordan) claimed sovereignty over the West Bank, but was not recognized by the international community. Many people are under the impression that there was Palestine that Israel occupied, but it never existed.  From a historical perspective, its really an outrage that the Green Line would be considered the final border. Never before in history would a group have started and lost so many wars and and yet not lose territory as a result. After the Arabs started the first war in 1948, where the ceasefire line became the Green Line, the Arabs said that they did NOT recognize Israel at all with any borders and that the Green Line *was only a ceasefire line and did not represent an acknowledgement of ***any*** Israeli territory*. The Israelis themselves noted that the Green Line did not represent the extent of their territorial claims. After the Arabs attacked again in 1967, after losing the West Bank, they again refused to recognize Israel at all, and actually said that they resolved to attack Israel again as soon as practical. To this day most Arab countries don't recognize Israel under any borders. So under what logic is Israel limited to the 1948 borders, which none of their antagonists recognized then, nor after 1967, nor after 1973, nor even today? Its only since 2002 that Arab leaders have expressed a willingness to recognize Israel in exchange for a Palestine in all of the West Bank and Gaza- and Israeli leaders have responded that they believe the proposal is a good place to start negotiations.  What's more, not a single settlement is on stolen land that actually belongs to any Palestinian. The very article we are responding to is about this very topic. All settlements are either on public land that belonged to the British government and after that the Jordanian government, or on land that was stolen from Jews when they were ethnically cleansed from the West Bank in 1948, or on land legally purchased from its legal owners. That's it. Not a single square inch of stolen land.  What's more, to the extent that Israeli forces are in the West Bank, they are there under the *explicit* agreement of the Palestinian government through the Oslo Accords. In the Oslo Accords, both sides agreed that Israel would police Areas B and C. The Palestinians have their own police force in Area A, where the majority of Palestinians live.  I have nothing against Palestinians, Arabs, or Muslims. I am just concerned that in deference to the much larger and more powerful group, Israel won't get a fair shot at surviving. Israel is about 0.02% of the land area of MENA. This quibbling over a sliver of a sliver- by which I mean the 10% of the West Bank that the Palestinians could offer Israel today and they would immediately agree to that- seems really over the top and unfair. Sunni Muslim Arabs have so many countries where they would be more than welcome, where their culture is the predominant culture. And they don't have to worry about seeing any Jews in them any more, they were already ethnically cleansed in the aftermath of Israel's creation, regardless of having nothing to do with it. Jews only have one. And its a shitty one where 50% of the land area is a desert. Different Israeli people claim land for different reasons. Strategic/economical/religious reasons or come combination.  There are many secular people who have no religious motivation but think the Israel annexation of land is justified and there are religiously motivated people who think Israel/Jews have a divine right to the land.  Take East Jerusalem for example   British decide its too troublesome and leave it to the UN to figure out who gets what.  UN said Jerusalem was supposed to be an international city.  During the first war Israel took the West and Jordan took the East.   In the six days war Jordan (tricked by Egypt) attacked Israel (who had preemptively/sneak attacked Egypt) and Israel took the Eastern half.    Israel looks at it as strategically important (having an enemy occupy the other half of a major city is dangerous), historically important( contains the historical Jewish district), and as essentially spoils of war.  Israel later annexes the Eastern part and starts building settlements (because of strong economic incentives plus religious and strategic ones).       How much do you get paid to blindly support Zionism? > No country in the world considers this territory disputed. It's disputed like Poland was disputed after the Nazi invasion. The security council specifically calls Israel the occupier, calls the land the Palestinian Territories, and calls on Israel to withdraw.  What the world considers doesn't really matter. The facts are the facts. Comparisons to Poland are idiotic since Poland was an actual country while palestine was nothing more than the name of a region, the same way the Midwest is a region in the US. Are Midwesterners an ethnic group who should be given their own country?  >It was taken from Jordan in 1967. Jordan gave all Palestinians citizenship. Israel militarily occupies them while denying them citizenship. In 1988 King Hussein made Palestine an independent Palestinian state, dividing the state of Jordan into two. That's when it became Palestinian rather than Jordanian. The age of Palestinian identity is wholly irrelevant. Most middle eastern and African national identities were created very recently around the same time from 1850-1950 during and after colonization/decolonization, prior to which these lands were part of multi-national empires.  Jordan was never the recognized sovereign of the land. When the british mandate ended, they went to war and took it but no one recognized that as a legitimate act. When Jordan decided to enter the fray in the Six Day War, Israel managed to push the Jordanian military forces out of Judea and Samaria. If Jordan's occupation made the land a valid part of Jordan, than Israel's occupation makes it a valid part of Israel. You can't have it both ways.  >Hey have them all Jordanian citizenship. It's irrelevant whether it's independent or part of Jordan, the people weren't stateless and militarily occupied.  If they have Jordanian citizenship, they should be deported to Jordan. But Jordan doesn't want them.  >It's not an occupied state, it's an occupied territory. No country or international law disagree with his outside Israel.  It is occupied disputed territory, and the dispute has been ongoing since the last recognized administrative body(British Mandate) ended it's sovereignty over it.  >Israel never claimed the West Bank. Israel claimed Israel. I have no clue what history you read. The expansionist aims came after 1967, to the horror of the founding father of Israel, Ben Gurion, who opposed any and all expansionism beyond the 1967 borders.  There was no such thing as the west bank until the armistice line of 1949. At that time, Israel was trying to secure the entirety of the land from the Jordan to the sea, since the Partition Plan was rejected and the arabs went to war. Think about what you are saying, Israel went so far as halfway into Jerusalem and then decided to stop short of the Old City and Temple Mount? That was the plan? OK, whatever you say. And what are these borders you are talking about? The arabs states demanded that the armistice line NOT be considered a border because they wanted to regroup and try to wipe out Israel again. Now that you see those goals are no longer possible, you want to retroactively pretend those armistice lines are a border? Get real.  >It was Jordanian prior to 1967. Some people wanted it to be Palestinian, like most Arab neighbors and the PLO, but that was the only controversy. There was no 'dispute' whatsoever with Israel. Israel took control in 1967 and systematically denied citizenship and rights to the people living there. It's undeniably occupied by all definitions.  According to whom? No one recognized it. Israel didn't recognize it as Jordanian. They disputed the final status of the land. That makes it disputed territory. > The security council specifically calls Israel the occupier, calls the land the Palestinian Territories, and calls on Israel to withdraw.  Heck, even the Israeli Supreme Court has recognized that the territory is held by Israel under a belligerent military occupation. > No, under international law, the land is occupied.  What law? Some resolutions passed by UN? That isn't law. The UN doesn't have sovereignty over independent countries.  >""Disputed"" means that the borders have not been identified by international law.  That precisely describes the situation with Israel. No one recognizes final defined borders.  >In this case, international law clearly recognizes the borders of Israel and this falls outside those borders.  That may be your desire but it is not fact.  >Ergo, this is an occupation.  Ergo, it isn't.  > Israel might dispute those borders because they want to take possession of said land, but that's an internal issue for Israel, not an issue per international law. International law of very clear on this and Israel is in the wrong (for the umpteenth time).  You are completely wrong. You have soaked up the propaganda which controls the narrative but it is based on false premises and outright lies. > Thats a bit of a weak argument... because the people living there did not form what we consider a nation (but had homes, villages, families, communities), they are not able to share the rights we consider to be fair?  I am not talking about the morality here. I am talking about the definition of the conflict. Inflammatory language does not help, not does conflating the situation with false claims about what it is and isn't. I am all for arabs having a country to call their own. I just don't necessarily think it should come at the cost of Israeli security.  >Im far from an anti-Israeli/anti-Semite or even always pro-Palestinian (i pity them in many ways but their tendency to indiscriminate violence is their biggest enemy) but Israel is these days ultra-realpolitik in their calculations. As long as the iron dome and IDF serve to neuter the cost of continued conflict without reducing the benefifs (that is to say, they get to justify their own actions as a response to violence without actuallh suffering anywhere near equal costs) they have no incentive to peace.  If you think there are no real costs you are unaware of the suffering that has been wrought by the rocket attacks. No, the numbers are not as high as casualties in gaza, but they are real and devastating, not to mention the fear of constant attack people live with. If you wonder why Israel is so reactionary on this stuff, imagine what it is like growing up with the constant fear of being attacked. It changes the psyche and until there is a generation or two without violence, there will never be peace. I have sympathy for the people being put in the middle of this conflict. The worst enemy of the palestinians is their own leaders, selling them on the lie that if they can hold out just a little longer, kill a few more jews, sacrifice their lives in pointless acts of violence, they will soon get everything they want. It is time for them to get real and accept that they are not in the strong negotiating position.   > There was no state of Israel either until land that Palestinians called home was given to them.  It wasn't given to them. They lived there, their ancestors lived there, they returned to the home of their ancestors. Why does it make more sense for arabs to return to land they claim belonged to their ancestors but not Jews? Treating ethnic and religious groups differently, there's a word for that, what could it be? >There was no state of Israel either until land *both Arabs and Jews* called home was *fought over*.  FIFY Disputed since 1948, when Jordan crossed their actual internationally recognized border in an attempt to expand westward and push the Jews into the sea. Where was all the outrage and condemnation of occupation when Jordan crossed their border to take the land? Oh, it's only a problem when Jews do it? Yeah, that is racism. None of those are actual countries. That would be like saying you are from the country of Midwest United States or Eastern Europe. It is a regional name, not a country. Stop spreading lies. Oh, you forgot the All Palestine Government formed by the Arab League in 1948, during the 1948 War (though Jordan refused to allow the areas it occupied to be administered by the entity).   > Okay, so because you deny it exists, it isn't a country. Then there isn't a country called Israel.  No, because history denies that it exists, it isn't a country.  There is nothing abstract or obfuscated here. You just don't like the facts so you are trying to insert ""alternative facts."" It was a good try, but a failure nonetheless. > ""Gee, just accept that the 1967 invasion never happened, and then poof, no problem!""  Invasion? LOL. Now that is some revisionist history. Not like the surrounding countries were massing troops for an invasion, or Israel begged Jordan to stay out of the fight, right? And that territory was never EVER Jordan's to begin with. When it comes to lying, it seems like you just can't help yourself. > But... do you have a flag?  Eddie Izzard, 1998 You think a propaganda website holds any sway? Think again. I don't see who or what you are responding to. Why not? (also serious) The Guardian is reputable, but it also reports from a particular political perspective, as it says in its description of its [mission](https://www.theguardian.com/the-scott-trust/2015/jul/26/the-scott-trust).  The Economist, another British newspaper to which I subscribe, also includes its political perspective in its mission statement. I respect the fact that they acknowledge their political leanings rather than pretending they don't exist like most American news sources.  But we also can't pretend these political leanings don't exist.  None of that has to do with the current article; an Israeli court already ruled that the land belongs to Palestinians, and I'm glad it's being returned to them.  I just thought you might want to know a little more about The Guardian. Please try not to let emotion get the better of you: They'd be butchered by individuals, not by a religion. This distinction is important, because it helps us recall that different Mohammedans believe different things -- some are peaceful, some are violent. In Nigeria some oppose Western education (Boko Haram); in the US others attend Ivy League schools; in Syria some are killing others over such disagreements. The previous settlement was exactly as illegal under international law as the new one, so there's no change in that regard.   What *did* change, is that an actual Palestinian family got their land back. This is a net positive, no matter how you spin it.  But hey, congratulations for implicitly supporting the far-right Israelis who opposed that eviction, and sharing their disdain towards private Palestinian property rights. They'd certainly be glad to use your argument. After all, if the international law situation stays the same, and that's the only thing that matters, why should they be forced move?  [removed] Everybody picks a side. But of course when someone has a different side it must mean that he is being paid.  Yes.   More like you stole their house twenty years ago. It has two locations where it is moving them to, both illegal settlements.  Ah, yes, ethnic cleansing at its finest, Israeli style. And you are morally OK with Israel's ethnic cleansing programs? Arabs controlled the land in question for 19 out of the last 500 years, and it was an unrecognized occupation resulting from one war of aggression, and it was lost following another war of aggression. Literally happened a few weeks ago.  http://www.timesofisrael.com/settlers-reportedly-attack-idf-soldiers-near-susiya/  Any questions? Or are you still going to defend the outlaws which attack the people who protect their nation. *spelling Very doubtful, given that:  (1) The Palestinians claiming private ownership in the expanded portions of existing settlements these settlers were supposed to move to under the 'deal' they made with the Israeli government late last year have already filed complaints with the Israeli Courts (i.e., there is no need for 'self-help' when they are already getting relief from the Court system); and, (2) Palestinian violence against Israelis in the West Bank since the Second Intifada almost exclusively falls into two categories not at issue here:  (a) Protests and demonstrations where rocks and other items are thrown at Israeli and Palestinian security forces, which the IDF prevents from taking place at actual settlements; and, (b) discrete attacks of opportunity, either by members of militant groups or average Palestinians, which, again, almost never occur at or in actual settlements because they are perpetrated when security is lowest (bus stops in common areas, the entrances to one of the hundreds of Israeli military checkpoints scattered across the occupied territories, etc.).  Actual attacks inside settlements are exceedingly rare, as evidenced by how often the few that occur are pointed to over and over to justify violence against Palestinians.  Moreover, setting aside the practical matter of how some Palestinian living in the West Bank meaning to do harm to the settlers at Amona would get through, first the massive military presence, then the hundreds of armed and alert relio-fascist teenagers who have rushed to the site, then attack the actual settlers... Why would they?  At a moment when the far-right religious extreme of Israel is banding together with the far-right settler extreme against the military and the far-right government, why would any Palestinian try to place themselves between the groups and give them a mutual enemy to bond over? It's bribe money, and for more purposes than peace with Israel. The Egyptian military largely answers to the US/Western powers.  And the Egyptian military is in charge of Egypt and by extension, what is arguably the single most strategically valuable waterway in the world, the Suez Canal. Egypt gets 1b, Israel gets 3b+  Are they fighting? No? Then it's peace.  >peace ps/Submit noun 1. freedom from disturbance; quiet and tranquility. ""you can while away an hour or two in peace and seclusion"" synonyms: tranquility, calm, restfulness, peace and quiet, peacefulness, quiet, quietness; More 2. freedom from or the cessation of war or violence. ""the Straits were to be open to warships in time of peace"" synonyms: law and order, lawfulness, order, peacefulness, peaceableness, harmony, nonviolence; formalconcord ""we pray for peace"" 100% bullshit. The exact opposite is true. Palestinians have accepted many two state solutions with equal land swaps and Israel rejected every one. Israel Has never agreed to 1967 border with land swaps ever.  Palestinians agreed to equal land swaps, Israel just demanded territory. I can hold Palestinians accountable for what they do wrong, but when it comes to offering fair peace  deals they offered a deal within the bounds of what the international community demands and Israel did not.  No, I call Israelis who illegally settled occupied east Jerusalem and the West Bank settlers. Also any Palestinians from the Palestinian Territories who illegally built settlements in West Jerusalem or Israel proper are also settlers.  The wikipedia pages are not bad to get a barebones view of the history of the conflict(s) over the last decades. Where there are conflicting naratives they normally present both views.  In fact the edit war which you can look back on there is something of a mirror of the actual middle east.  I second that, Benny Morris is indeed very rigorous in his historical review.  Be wary of the post-modern historians who have abandoned the notion that a historian can get closer to an objective history - for them, the narrative is everything, and there's no need to rely on many sources, validate the sources, give different weights to different sources, or even differentiate made up stories from sources.   A good example of such a ""historian"" is Ilan Pappe, whos book Benny Morris [criticized meticulously](https://newrepublic.com/article/85344/ilan-pappe-sloppy-dishonest-historian). I thought the arab states were wanting a pipeline to supply europe with oil and undercut the russians? Obviously russia's gonna help Assad as russia makes a lot of money supplying europe with oil. (these two things are so corrupt, as its just competing - issue comes in with the CIA going in and starting the ""civil war"" when in my opinion of reality it's the US doing the rich gulf states bidding. >It is really hard to get an unbiased version.  Then you give a biased version.   LOL. >It isn't about antisemitism in the Middle East, it is about xenophobia in the Middle East.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  That and the fact that 400 Palestinian villages were razed to the ground and renamed in Hebrew in order to create the state that is now Israel.  That *might* have something to do with it. Actually, it's about Zionist terrorists creating a ""secular"" nation that just, coincidentally, happened to be where their invisible man in the sky wanted, which quite upset the people who had been living there for generations    Or y'know, whatever. > Israel has been attacked by every neighbor for over a century.  Funny, given that the country didn't exist until the UN created it in 1948, which, by my count, is considerably less than a century ago. Israel hasn't been attacked by neighbors, they have victims in the area. Anybody who is not a part of Israel suffered for it's creation.  I'm still unclear on your justification for building new settlements. You are redirecting this from land grabs to ""the right to exist"", which is ridiculous. I understand you are probably just copy pasting replies, but choose a more relevant one.  Nobody anywhere is telling Israel to put down their arms. You have only been fighting a non-existent strawman for this entire comment. They are asking Israel to stop illegally talking occupied Palestinian territory. Absolutely nothing about laying down their arms or not defending themselves. And the 1967 war was an attack by Israel on Egypt, not by the Arabs against Israel. You said the exact opposite of the truth.  I hear they also call Al-Quds by its historical name, Jerusalem. Strange people. Ancient Judea and Samaria were much larger than the West Bank. The renaming is just a blatant attempt to highlight Israeli territorial claims.  So now we're rewriting history.  Israeli settlement expansion since 1967 has been relentless. The land that they have given back has been areas with virtually no settlers. The settlement expansionism has been continual and rapid every year since they started.  Thanks for the response but this sounds very biased. I don't know what's true but the guy you're responding to comes across as much more impartial.  If you want people to believe you you need to seem level headed and fair. Emotion has no place here. If it's going to be behind the wall soon, it's as good as being behind the wall - that's just playing with numbers. > The separation wall is NOT the border.  There is no border currently, the separation wall is a De-facto border.  Germany had its borders redrawn by the allies (it lost territory), and then had to absorb millions of German refugees as Germans were forced out of their homes.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_and_expulsion_of_Germans_(1944%E2%80%9350)  The end result was a contiguous Germany ""with ZERO FUCKING SETTLERS."" Care to deflect the subject some more? How is that relevant to a demilitarization of a future Palestinian state? It's very much obvious that in any such state, it would be ethnically cleansed of Jews (just as Palestinians like it). No-one expects settlers to remain there.     By the way, Berlin was in the GDR. So, not contiguous.    That's a matter for the security council, otherwise anybody cam say 'they're coming right for us' and Pearl Harbor the neighbors like Israel did.   Fair point.  Given that the new Ambassador to Israel and the Orange Oligarch's son-in-law, who he put in charge of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, are both very vocal supporters of the settlements (and for the Ambassador at least, financial backers of them), you are probably correct.  Given the Pimento Potentate's mercurial demeanor, however, it's difficult to tell at this juncture. Basically you are trying to find some conflict that isn't being addressed enough so that you can play a whataboutism game make people ignore the Palestinian people and what Israel is doing to them. This is bullshit. If enough isn't being done for the Rohingya then argue for action to help them. Don't argue against help for Palestine.  Oh really? Were 30,000 ISIS fighters not massacred in the last year and was ISIS not wiped out of Libya entirely and did ISIS not lose 30% of its territory in the last year? Is North Korea not sanctioned and isolated by 99% of the countries in the world? Were global sanctions not placed on Iran that caused a severe recession and forced them to agree to a nuclear deal with the P5+1? Was Myanmar not isolated until they allowed democratic elections? Going back farther, was Yugoslavia not bombed until the genocide ended? Did the UN not authorize a military intervention to remove Saddam Hussein from Kuwait? Did the UN not authorize a military intervention to reverse the North Korean invasion of South Korea? Face it, plenty of shit gets done. Israel is one of the only places where there are no consequences for Israel's violations of international law.  Because millions of people aren't denied human rights and rendered stateless there. If Israel annexed Palestine and gave all the Palestinians citizenship then it would be comparable to those examples you gave.  Israel could agree to a two state solution based on 1967 borders with equal land land swaps which  Palestine has repeatedly offered and which Israel has repeatedly rejected. That's what the world is demanding. It's not that complicated.  Ethnic Cleansing isn't just genocide. The Trail of Tears for example was ethnic cleansing.   And there have been massacres like Sabra and Shattilah. And Israel kept Palestinians around because they were cheap labour.   Israel has not offered Palestinians citizenship. At all. Like they will never do it. Mostly because there are more Palestinians than Jews and this would result in a Jewish minority state.   Israel can leave the land to Palestinians who wish to be free. You can't settle on occupied land. We made the rule so that we never have another Holocaust and WW II.    > palestinians living on the palestinian territories are not even citizens of Israel. And when Israel has offered them citizenship (like with Jerusalem), many have rejected it. >   They are occupied by the Israeli milatry. They live under the milatry control of Israel.   >You cannot win fanatics.  The Israelis are the fanatics.  If you're going to go that route then Israel should at least offer to buy them out.  If the offer was reasonable a lot of them would probably take it. It always ends up with someone calling for the ethnic cleansing of millions of Palestinians and depopulating massive Palestinian cities as the way to end Israeli crimes against Palestine. How about no? It's way easier for the world to take action against Israeli expansionism than it is to ethnically cleanse Palestine of Arabs.  So you want people who have lived in Palestine for more than a thousand years to up sticks and move just because Jews need some land. Why not set that country up in say... America. Why is Arab land less important to them than your land is to you.   Why does the Jewish Majority country need to occupy the West Bank? Isn't all of Israel proper enough? Does it really need the West Bank? For what?   And mate.   You pretty much described the logic of the Trail of Tears,   And lebensraum. The irony.   I think that's covered by Article 47.  Whether the territories are considered occupied or annexed the Geneva Convention still applies.  ""Art. 47. Protected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present Convention by any change introduced, as the result of the occupation of a territory, into the institutions or government of the said territory, nor by any agreement concluded between the authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power, nor by any annexation by the latter of the whole or part of the occupied territory."" >After the Arabs attacked again in 1967   I'm fairly pro-Israel but Israel attacked in 1967.  I think there is an argument to be made that it was a justified preemptive attack but I think its silly to just label it as the Arabs attacking.   The Arabs and Israelis were posturing (Arabs for domestic purposes with Israel responding) and the Arabs made some very aggressive moves and may have been legitimately planning an attack. A big part of it was actually the USSR lying to Egypt that Israel had placed troops on the Syrian border ready to attack.    And yet, none of that makes it right to go somewhere and start a country through terrorism.  Which is exactly what happened. Statelessness does not preclude the application of the Fourth Geneva Convention. There is a consistent consensus that, even if Jordan was not the rightful sovereign, since it was a signatory of the convention, its protection measures must be applied regardless, in order to protect the right of the population that was under its rule at the time. The whole point of the Convention is to ensure this protection for vulnerable peoples in times of conflict whenever possible.  Yes, it's called illegal settlement expansion.  Whoops guess I wasn't clear- racism towards the people he's referring to as ""arabs"".  &gt; Comparisons to Poland are idiotic since Poland was an actual country while palestine was nothing more than the name of a region, the same way the Midwest is a region in the US. Are Midwesterners an ethnic group who should be given their own country?  Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire and then later Jordan, just like California is part of the USA or The Negev is part of Israel. These regions don't lack rights just because they are part of different polities. Most of Asia and Africa were part of empires for thousands of years until decolonization when European style nation states became popular. Being an independent nation state doesn't give you special rights over people from other types of polities. Palestinian Arabs have equal rights to Jews, as much as that must pain you to hear.   If the Midwest wants to be independent then it can be independent. It's not up to China to decide the fate of the midwest. Jordan and Palestine decided to slip into two states in 1988. Deal with it. That's their business, it's not up to you. Palestine is as legitimate of a nation as any other.     &gt; Jordan was never the recognized sovereign of the land. When the british mandate ended, they went to war and took it but no one recognized that as a legitimate act.  It was de Jure Palestinian and de facto Jordanian. No matter what perspective you take there is no case for Israeli expansionism in Palestine.   &gt;?When Jordan decided to enter the fray in the Six Day War, Israel managed to push the Jordanian military forces out of Judea and Samaria. If Jordan's occupation made the land a valid part of Jordan, than Israel's occupation makes it a valid part of Israel. You can't have it both ways.   If Israel wanted to incorporate the Palestinian people into Israel then there is a case for that. Two polities would become one. There is precedent for such things. Israel does not want to do that and has always said that the Arabs of Palestine can never have any human rights or citizenship under Israeli control. That has always been and continues to be the official Israeli position. Literally apartheid. That's the fundamental crime if the Israeli occupation.     > If they have Jordanian citizenship, they should be deported to Jordan. But Jordan doesn't want them.  No, if they want Jordanian citizenship they should unite Palestine and Jordan. Palestine and Jordan have already entered into talks to start this process of confederation once Palestine gains its independence. Peres and Hussein both agreed to the Peres Hussein agreement in 1987 to return Palestine to Jordanian control. Shamir vetoed it. That's one of the main reasons why Jordan renounced its claims in favor of Palestinian independence in 1988.     > There was no such thing as the west bank until the armistice line of 1949. At that time, Israel was trying to secure the entirety of the land from the Jordan to the sea, since the Partition Plan was rejected and the arabs went to war. Think about what you are saying, Israel went so far as halfway into Jerusalem and then decided to stop short of the Old City and Temple Mount? That was the plan? OK, whatever you say. And what are these borders you are talking about? The arabs states demanded that the armistice line NOT be considered a border because they wanted to regroup and try to wipe out Israel again. Now that you see those goals are no longer possible, you want to retroactively pretend those armistice lines are a border? Get real.   These lines are accepted by the international community. Any change to them must be done through negotiations and land swaps. What various Arab states wanted in 1948 is irrelevant. No shit no Arab was happy with the Jews taking 60% of the land despite being only 40% of the population in the UN partition plan. No shit they even more strongly opposed the 1967 boulder which gave Israel 78% of the land and the Palestinians 22%. What the Arabs want doesn't matter. The international community decided this and hasn't wavered since UNSC 242. The Arabs and Israelis can make any insane demands they want, it's irrelevant.   And until well after 1967 the common Israeli position of people like Ben Gurion as well the international community was that Jerusalem would be an international city like envisioned in UNSC 181. That changed later when Israel started to augment its demands to suit its new power over the Palestinian Territories.    > The UN doesn't have sovereignty over independent countries.  In that case, Israel does not exist. You forget that it was the UN that declared Israel's claims of statehood to be valid under international law. If you don't think the UN has jurisdiction, then that recognition of Israel's statehood is invalid.  You didn't think that through, did 'ya sport? Hmm, treating ethnic and religious groups differently.  What is that?  Maybe I should call the Knesset and ask their policy about illegal settlement activity and their feelings towards Islam.  Go call a kettle black why don't you Mr. Pot. Shh! There is no room for a neutral party here! There was no internationally recognized border in 1948. Israel just seized the territory, there was no internationally recognized border until after the war when the armistice lines became the border.  What does race have to do with it?  Yeah, Reddit was fucking silent back in 1948. What jerks we were then, huh! What with most of us not being alive, but it's okay because as we all know condemning actions of the past will fix them in the same way that it's impossible for wrong actions in the present to be reversed. > Where was all the outrage and condemnation...  There was quite a bit at the time, even in the Arab League, which publicly opposed Jordanian annexation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Not being an independent nation does not mean that you don't have rights. It's like if China occupies California and says ""California was never an independent country so really it's just disputed, not occupied"". This is idiotic.  The region hasn't been independent since before the times of Rome so, yeah technically correct. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Palestine_(region)#Late_Ottoman_period Stop trying to ethnically cleanse history. Israel begged Jordan to stay out if the war after it attacked its ally who it had a defensive pact with? Good grief. By your definition most of the countries who fought the Nazis were really aggressors because Hitler begged them not to defend their allies.  I guess Israel's borders just expanded by accident? I have no problem saying that the first strike was necessary. But it was followed by an invasion of enemy territory and occupation of that territory.   Just look at a before / after map.  When the question of occupied territories comes up it always gets trotted out that the seizure of land in the Six Day War was a defensive move by Israel against planned Arab invasion. Prominent Israelis who participated in that war have debunked that including Mattityahu Peled and Moshe Dayan. It was an offensive war, whether for Israel's safety or not, and it might have been, the land should have been given back. I'm just wondering how/if they track land ownership on that side of the world. As a westerner, I only know how they do it here, and am wondering what the parallel process is. Ops commented as if the Guardian is some shitty newspaper run by Somalian warlord.   I read both Guardian and The Economist obsessively. They are brilliant.  Ah yes, because Arab Muslim bystanders and witnesses are usually the first to condone the violence that makes them end up as collaterals, and are usually also the first to capture, imprison, and execute their own rabid citizens.   It's not like they hand out candy instead or something like that, is it? Millions of people are under occupation. That is what matters. Not one settlement.  As I said, I haven't accused you of being paid, I related it to the ""Israeli Online Defense Academy"" that the person I responded to was joking about. I'm not too sure our sides even differ that much considering I am also in favour of recognising Israel (and Palestine) but both only within well-defined and internationally agreed on borders. If that's your opinion too, great, it's just that when a lot of reddit users have their post history full of solely one topic and one position that it looks funny. If that's due to being paid or if it's just done during their leisure time is not of my concern.  > Everybody picks a side  Only close-minded people blindly stick to a side. Looking at your comments, you seem like a close-minded person. Methinks the lady doth protest too much. More like you got new neighbours and tried to kill them all, lost, and they took almost all your stuff, but left you a garage.  Instead of seeing your error, you use the garage as an excuse to launch fireworks all the time and dump your garbage there [Citation Needed]  The article isn't claiming that Only someone like you could claim both that the settlements are illegal and need to be removed, but also that Israel removing them is ethnic cleansing and how dare they.  ""Damned if you do, damned if you don't"" is proof of unthinking irrational bias on your part. Egypt gets 1.5 billion in military aid, plus more in civil and humanitarian aid. Israel gets 3.2 billion in military aid.  ""Military aid"" means a gift card to American weapons manufacturers. Egypt gets 2b give one example of a peace agreement to which the Palestinians have agreed, and one that Israel rejected. I'm not a duck! I'm an anti-duck! Fair is subjective. If the Palestinians didn't think it was fair, they should have counter offered. They didn't in 2000, or in 2008. And it's not for you to decide what is fair to the Palestinians; only the Palestinians can decide that.   Olmert's plan included land swaps, as did the Clinton parameters, including expanding territory. I tried my best. If you can do better, I'd love to read it. It is amusing how he conveniently ignored the fact that the Jewish state was created by Europeans for European nationals against the wishes of the indigenous population that lived there, the opinion of whom was rendered worthless, through violent Apartheid enacted in cooperation with a colonial power. This status que was imposed on all of the indigenous population in Palestine regardless of their race or religion, and yes this includes the opinions of the minority of non-settler Jews living in Palestine.   Kurdish nationalism, unlike  Zionism, was not founded by Europeans, Kurdish nationalists did not come into the region through violence, you will find that Arab regimes do not represent Arab people, the claim that they support Assad over ""xenophobia"" is incredibly naive. The Syrian civil war is being fought by world powers with Syrian lives and all of them including the western backed Arab dictatorships, are looking after their own interest. to be honest, he did warn before hand. Alternatively a group of people who had just been massacred by the Germans chose to return to tie m their ancestral homeland and transformed it from a desert wasteland to somewhere livable. Now terrorists try to take it back from them on a daily basis or die to get their 72 virgin girls in the sky. Funny how things can be spun both ways. The UN did pass a piece of paper to create Arab and Jewish states. That plan never got off the ground.  The Arab states, quite logically though rather cold, felt they could simply exterminate the Jews. See the Kings of Egypt, Jordan, and Iraq who promised their people slaughter. But the Jews protected their existence and formed the state of Israel from the land they'd protected.  After all, Jews had been protecting themselves for some time. That is what I mean by over a century. The Zionist project (Jewish nationalism) began over a century ago. European Jews joining their Middle Eastern cousins in the land of Jerusalem. Yes, the whole area belongs to the Sunni Arabs. A Shia or Christian or Kurdish or Jewish state is an abomination on the pure land of Muhammad's people. Israel withdrew from Gaza.  The Gazans didn't get busy developing their territory. They use most of their concrete building smuggling tunnels and most of their steel building rockets shot at civilians.  Why would Israel retreat from the West Bank when it is likely to simply strengthen their enemies? Enemies who brag about their desire to exterminate Israel? > And the 1967 war was an attack by Israel on Egypt, not by the Arabs against Israel. You said the exact opposite of the truth.  How many times do people have to explain this to you kid? Its literally insanity. There is a reason everything labels it a preemptive strike...learn some history and accept the fact that you are wrong. Yes Israel fired the first shot, but it did so after Egypt expelled UN peacekeepers and moved their armies to Israel's border. > I hear they also call Al-Quds   Israelis? No. People referred to Jerusalem as Yerushalaim long before the Muslims decided to call it Al-Quds. Just like people referred to Judea long before Jordan was established and people started calling it ""the West Bank"". Muslims in particular have a habit of illegally occupying lands, renaming lands and rewriting history. Therefore, your analogy is wrong. Also, the guy claimed that only religious people call it Judea and Samaria, which is false. You're embarrassing Canadians I'm aware of that. Ancient Palestine was also much larger, but that's irrelevant because what's more known as the West Bank was part of what was known as Judea and Samaria before the bar khovka revolt. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_name_""Palestine""  Specifically,   >In 135 CE, the Greek ""Syria Palaestina""[b]was used in naming a new Roman province from the merger of Roman Syria and Roman Judaea after theRoman authoritiescrushed theBar Kokhba Revolt. Are you saying Sinai is useless? It gave Israel vast strategic depth against Egypt, the leading Arab nation that had sneak-attacked Israel twice. It had defended the land, developed the land, built relations with the Bedouin (who hate the Egyptian state, by the way. Look at the insurgency. There was no insurgency against Israel in Sinai). All that was abandoned just so Egypt could save face and sign a peace treaty.  The idea that Israel is expansionist is ridiculous. If that were true, the West Bank would be cleared, the way the Jordanians did back in 1948. You can google any of the facts that both of us wrote and see for yourself who is right. I wrote strong claims, but that doesn't mean that it's based. The other dude wants to make it sound like it's just some vague mutual conflict, rather than Israeli occupation and illegal expansionism over the Palestinian Territories. One of us is right.  Spin it as you like. Settlement building far from the Green Line is on overdrive since Netanyahu is at the helm. His policies make clear he wants the entire ""Eretz Yisrael"", except perhaps the Arab cantons of Area A.  The internationally supported border is the 1967 lines. The separation wall is the arbitrary line that Israel created wherever it wanted to illegally take land.  There were no American or Russia settlements in Germany with their own roads and no claim for those settlements being a part of America or Russia. Area A and Area B cannot be countries. They are exactly like Bantustans in Apartheild South Africa.   >it would be ethnically cleansed of Jews (just as Palestinians like it).  PA has proposed many times to include the settlements and give the Jews Palestinian citizenship.   The problem is many settlers want to live in the holy land in the holy Zionist state. They want that land to be inside Israel.   The whole settlement enterprise was started for this reason. To prevent Israel form withdrawing from Judea and Samaria. The UN failed to maintain peace. Like I said, Egypt threw out the UN peacekeepers and massed offensive troops on the border, all while attacking Israeli civilians.  Remember, an official state of war still existed between Israel and neighboring states that were amassing troops, attacking civilians, and sending out genocidal rhetoric.  So...  I mean, I know we are taught in school to just go to the teacher whenever four bullies are pushing us, but that isn't how it works in the real world. Palestine and Israel is massively over played and emphasised so gulf states can distract their populations.   Also the Palestinians  need to actually come to the table and enter negotiations themselves rather than just try lob mortars and bait the Israelis then cry to the international media when Israel legitimately responds.  >Oh really? Were 30,000 ISIS fighters not massacred in the last year and was ISIS not wiped out of Libya entirely and did ISIS not lose 30% of its territory in the last year?   And the 8 million people displaced causing the worst humanitarian crises since the holocaust...whats been done about that? Oh right the two largest english speaking nations decided to go bat shit fascist and ignore all those people. The only reason ISIS exists is becaise US meddling in the region. Subsequently causing all these people to flee and how to they help? By dropping more bombs.   >Is North Korea not sanctioned and isolated by 99% of the countries in the world?  Sanctions only hurt the people not regime it is a useless gesture. Hence why china did it.   >Were global sanctions not placed on Iran that caused a severe recession and forced them to agree to a nuclear deal with the P5+1? Was Myanmar not isolated until they allowed democratic elections?   Iran just test fired a medium range ballistic missile. I dont think they care.  >Going back farther, was Yugoslavia not bombed until the genocide ended?  Yes and actual genocide. Same can't be said about Rwanda or even the current genocide in the central african republoc. But Africa aye, guess palestinians are slightly more white. No need to worry about genocides. Plus no Jews no news.  And just so you are aware about the UN bias towards the Israeli Palestinian conflict. There have been 223 resolutions against Israel in the last 6 years, Syria has had 8. Facts presented by Ban Ki Moon.  Face it there is a UN agenda against Israel.    > Because millions of people aren't denied human rights   Are you suggesting that Arabs are denied human rights? Do you have proof for that? Yes, they are not citizens of Israel, thus they don't have the same rights as the Israelis (effectively they are foreigners), but that doesn't mean that they are denied ""human rights"". They have their own government.  > If Israel annexed Palestine and gave all the Palestinians citizenship then it would be comparable to those examples you gave  This is simply irrelevant to the question of settlements. The question of self-determination of Arabs in Judea and Samaria is not related to the legality of settlements. > That's what the world is demanding. It's not that complicated.   It is though. The 1967 are actually the 1949 armistice borders which the arabs didn't accept and started several wars over it. Thousands of people died because they didn't want to accept this borders. Now, after they lost, they are now saying we should go back to this border.   They literally caused the deaths of thousands of people because of it. Now it *is* difficult for Israelis to simply hand them with a smiley face the land after all that.   Ann yet, all the partition plans after that have been rejected by the palestinians even though they are about 95% of the 1967 borders.. > Ethnic Cleansing  You didn't wrote ethnic cleansing tough. You wrote ""genocide"". Also you are wrong. Around 20% of Israel population is Arab. Do you know how many Jews are in the palestinian territories? Literally 0 if it weren't for settlers. This *is* ethnic cleansing.   >Israel has not offered Palestinians citizenship. At all. Like they will never do it. Mostly because there are more Palestinians than Jews and this would result in a Jewish minority state.   This is false.   >Jerusalem Palestinians are permitted to apply for Israeli citizenship, provided they meet the requirements for naturalizationsuch as swearing allegiance to Israel and renouncing all other citizenshipswhich most of them refuse to do. At the end of 2005, 93% of the Arab population of East Jerusalem had permanent residency and 5% had Israeli citizenship.[65]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Jerusalem#Residency  Stop talking about shit you don't know nothing about. i agree they shouldent just be booted out destitue with nothing to their name did i say anywhere to kill palestinains? no. but nice try putting words in my mouth to try and demonize one side  the lands where won in war and are israels. should native land gained in north america over wars with the natives be given back to them?  >I'm fairly pro-Israel but Israel attacked in 1967. I think there is an argument to be made that it was a justified preemptive attack but I think its silly to just label it as the Arabs attacking.  I think you're ignoring Nasser sealing the straits of Tiran to israeli shipping - Israel's only port to the red sea and its only source of oil.  Israel had warned Egypt it would view this as Casus Belli - Coupled with his kicking out of peacekeepers at the same time, its clear what this meant to Israel.  Egypt purposely did the thing israel said would start war, and kicked out the peacekeepers.  Nasser started the war in 1967 that day, regardless of when the actual fighting happened. True. I usually refer to that case as the ""Arabs having started the war"" instead of saying that they attacked.  > In that case, Israel does not exist. You forget that it was the UN that declared Israel's claims of statehood to be valid under international law. If you don't think the UN has jurisdiction, then that recognition of Israel's statehood is invalid.  Nations exist based on their ability to maintain sovereignty over their territory. Even if the UN hadn't accepted Israel's declaration of independence, Israel would still be a country because it is independently administers it's territory. Does the USA only exist because the UN recognizes them or because the US military will obliterate anyone trying to impose it's sovereignty over it's territory and citizens?  >You didn't think that through, did 'ya sport?  Apparently, you did not. > Hmm, treating ethnic and religious groups differently. What is that? Maybe I should call the Knesset and ask their policy about illegal settlement activity and their feelings towards Islam. Go call a kettle black why don't you Mr. Pot.  You mean the Knesset that passes laws treating every Israeli citizen equal under the law, regardless of sex, gender, sexual orientation or religion? The Knesset that has arab and muslim members who often use their position to speak out against Israel and even incite violence? You know not of what you speak. > There was no internationally recognized border in 1948. Israel just seized the territory, there was no internationally recognized border until after the war when the armistice lines became the border.  Yes, no border, no country. Israel established itself there and ended up in dispute over the territory with Jordan. Jordan, not any other entity.  > there was no internationally recognized border until after the war when the armistice lines became the border.  Your lack of historical knowledge invalidates you from these discussions. The armistice line was specifically not a border at the insistence of the arab nations. They didn't want to establish a border lest it legitimize Israel, so they inserted language into every armistice agreement that the armistice line was absolutely NOT a border. But nice try rewriting history. Well, the UN Partition Plan was adopted by the General Assembly in 1948, with borders drawn up very differently than the 1949 Armistice Agreement (more Arab land). The plan was never implemented because of the war, but technically it was ""internationally recognized"". So, you are not entirely correct.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine Different rules for different ethnic groups is racism. If you condemn Israel for ""occupying"" Judea and Samaria but had nothing to say about it when Jordan did the same thing, you are a racist. > Yeah, Reddit was fucking silent back in 1948. What jerks we were then, huh! What with most of us not being alive, but it's okay because as we all know condemning actions of the past will fix them in the same way that it's impossible for wrong actions in the present to be reversed.  I didn't say reddit. The same UN that is condemning Israel and you seem to support was just fine with the way things were back them. Also, I don't know how old you are, but it I am sure there are plenty who were alive back then who didn't care about Jordanian occupation but can't shut up about Israel. Hypocrites.  > Reddit was fucking silent back in 1948  TO THE TIME MACHINE. Those actions led to the present situation. The Palestinians were offered full statehood in 1948. > There was quite a bit at the time, even in the Arab League, which publicly opposed Jordanian annexation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem.  Because the arabs all hate each other and wanted that slice of the pie for themselves. But the hypocrites criticizing Israel today were mostly silent back then. > Not being an independent nation does not mean that you don't have rights.  I never said it did. It doesn't, however, guarantee that you have an independent nation wherever you happen to want it.  >It's like if China occupies California and says ""California was never an independent country so really it's just disputed, not occupied"". This is idiotic.  California is part of an independent country? It is more like China occupies Antarctica (before international agreements that forbade it) and people don't like it but there isn't any precedent to prevent them from doing it. technically correct is the best correct. That is a nonsensical statement.  > Israel begged Jordan to stay out if the war after it attacked its ally who it had a defensive pact with? Good grief. By your definition most of the countries who fought the Nazis were really aggressors because Hitler begged them not to defend their allies.  No, Jordan believed the lies Nasser was telling them that Egypt was overpowering Israel and sending airstrikes into the country. The truth was that those radar signatures were Israeli aircraft returning from Egypt, but Hussein believed Egypt's claim that it was their aircraft. Not wanting to be left our of the spoils, Jordan entered the fray even though Israel asked them not to. Jordan attacked Israel to help Egypt and ended up getting their butts kicked. > I guess Israel's borders just expanded by accident? I have no problem saying that the first strike was necessary. But it was followed by an invasion of enemy territory and occupation of that territory.  They never had a border on their eastern front. It was an armistice line that the arabs demanded not be called a border. So the entire premise of your statement is false. You can't expand a border that never existed. > When the question of occupied territories comes up it always gets trotted out that the seizure of land in the Six Day War was a defensive move by Israel against planned Arab invasion. Prominent Israelis who participated in that war have debunked that including Mattityahu Peled and Moshe Dayan. It was an offensive war, whether for Israel's safety or not, and it might have been, the land should have been given back.  Except it was clearly a defensive war provoked by Egypt massing troops on the border and expelling UN peacekeepers. How was it a war of aggression by Israel when they were responding to the aggressive actions of Egypt? And it was certainly a defensive war with Jordan. Egypt convinced Jordan to help attack Israel when they saw the war wasn't going their way. You need to read up on you history. I assume they do it in the same or a similar way. Property is a thing there, too.  No, and that's part of the issue.  There are families that have been living on and cultivating the same land for hundreds of years, and so have their neighbors.  So, everybody there knows what belongs to whom in a functional sense, if not a legal one.  There was an effort in the mid 1800s when Palestine was ruled by the Ottoman Empire to conduct a land survey to sort some of this out, but it categorized land under their system.  In the west, we'd probably think of the system as having two categories: owned (and by whom) and unowned; or private and public.    For the Ottomans, it was a little more complicated.  There were 5 main categories, and only one rare type is what we would think of as ""private ownership.""  The rest were considered to be state owned but leased to tenants, communally owned or owned by religious trusts called waqfs.  But that state no longer exists, nor do many of the waqfs, and many of the communities were destroyed or displaced over the years of violence.  So many of the pieces of land in these categories never had deeds, and, even if those deeds did exist, the entities listed on them would no longer exist.  When the Ottomans turned over Palestine to the British mandate, things got even messier, records were lost and others were forged and faked.   You seem to have misunderstood my comment, which had nothing to do with the quality of the newspaper, and everything to do with appeals to human authority and not citing sources. I don't understand your question. I also don't understand why you're still generalizing. I think these generalizations interfere with humanitarian efforts. The Palestinian family who got their land back would probably object to how they ""don't matter"".  You know who *wouldn't* object to it? And indeed, would love to hear that? The far-right wingers who opposed that eviction, and the actual settlers of Amona.  It's funny where extremist dogmatism leads to.  Can't argue a point? Change the subject and pretend you were arguing something different Just because someone picked a side doesn't always mean he's close-minded. Would you say the same thing to those who believe in man-made climate change? Me neither. No, I look for a source in almost everything I comment on. A close minded person is the one that rejects sources because they don't fit his narrative. It's literally the first link in the article  http://m.dw.com/en/west-bank-amona-outpost-residents-accept-relocation-deal/a-36818944 You forget that these people were living there for centuries before migrants from Europe came and ethnically cleansed them to make way for these state. What you are doing is not unlike what what we did to the Indians in America. > Only someone like you  You mean someone with a sense of morality? Yes? Well, fuck me for having morals. I wonder why you don't have any. Could it be genetic? We don't need any help socializing our weapons manufacturers and Israel also gets supplemental military aid in addition to the 3.2b.  I wish more people understood this. They think Israel gets money from the US government when it's more like weapons manufacturers siphoning federal funds.  The Abbas Peres deal.  The Abbas Herzog deal. The Arab Peace Initiative. The Geneva Initiative. The offers made at the Taba Summit. Etc Not equal land swaps. Palestinians have made many offers and country offers in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2011, and 2014. > Olmert's plan included land swaps  Not of equal size, and even the greatly reduced territory he offered in return for the significant territory he wanted to take was of far inferior quality. what? why are you replying to my post with this? im talking about the qatar > turkey pipeline that was proposed to go thru syria The earliest claim from Israel comes from the Balfour Decleration that as a Jewish people the land is rightfully theirs as established by the British Imperial conquest and Jewish settlement of land after the Ottoman Empire fell, as a refuge for oppressed Jews in Europe. (for some it is ""return to zion as a chosen people"" but that really isn't very widely circulated)  The later one is the 1949 UN deceleration and partition plan, and citing that Palestinians have repeatedly violated it in efforts to gain back the whole country therefore military occupation was neccecery. Of course the Palestinian claim is that both of the above are illegal (or immoral) foundations.   The main conflict comes from IDP's from the various wars who claim that Israel has no right over the lands that they used to inhabit that the deceleration of independence was a justification for a land-grab sanctioned by the British Mandate. The religious aspect is small, most claims revolve around the want for self determination or among Hamas supporters compete return to pre-Mandate borders of a single nation.    The key problem for both sides is that the Palestinian Arabs have always opposed the immigration of Jews both changing the culture and putting pressure on land, and that Israel would be no longer the haven state if it where to grant full political partnership under a one-state solution.   Not contesting the larger politics of the Arab League and why they supported the Palestinians, but you could be forgiven for thinking that Arafat is some form of minor deity in Palestine, the nation is definitely more important than religion.   > you will find that Arab regimes do not represent Arab people  I've found that.  What is the solution? What Arab regime has it right? Jordan, with its dependence on foreign aid?  Saudi Arabia? With its dependence on foreign aid?  The Palestinian Authority? With its dependence on foreign aid?  Egypt? With its dependence on foreign aid?  Certainly a future Palestinian state can be like one of these states.    Who owned the land when they returned (serious question)? That's what a lot of people don't understand, myself included. If someone owned the land when they moved back, ancestral claims don't matter, right? I'm not sure how deeds/property rights work there, though. (seriously) Following are just a few of the many massacres committed by Jewish-Zionist terrorists, notably by the Zionist Hagana, Irgun and Stern ...

No, invasion and terrorism is an abomination.   Period. Even if the UN and Britain give you the green light, you're still causing human suffering, and for what? Again with the off topic pasted response. Thanks for the unrelated thought I guess, still makes no sense.  Calling something preemptive war doesn't excuse it. The 2003 Iraq war was also pre-emotive war. The 1914 German attack on France was also pre-emotive war. Not all pre-emotive wars are justified. Egypt expelling UN peacekeepers from Egypt is not a cause for war. Nasser told Israel that if it was concerned about the peacekeepers then Israel could have the peacekeepers on Israeli territory. Israel refused.  Calling something preemptive war doesnt excuse it. The 2003 Iraq war was also pre-emotive war. The 1914 German attack on France was also pre-emotive war.

Did any Israeli PM, in you eyes, wanted less than the entire ""Eretz Yisrael""?  Yitzhak Rabin's government built quite a bit of housing over there too, you know. > The whole settlement enterprise was started for this reason. To prevent Israel form withdrawing from Judea and Samaria.  Seriously.  I don't know how people can still be denying this.  Have they never heard of the Allon Plan?  It has been the plan since AT LEAST early 1968. Israel never accepted peacekeepers in the first place and their terrorist leader later admitted that Nasser wasn't a threat and they chose to go to war. Israel was previously the country that invaded Egypt the war before that one too not to mention their own threats and attacks to the neighbors.  You are confusing Hamas and the PA.  > Iran just test fired a medium range ballistic missile. I dont think they care.  Deal doesnt prevent that though.   > And the 8 million people displaced causing the worst humanitarian crises since the holocaust...whats been done about that?    Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey have taken millions each? Europe has taken millions more? Huge efforts are being made.     > Iran just test fired a medium range ballistic missile. I dont think they care.  That has nothing to do with the nuclear deal. The nuclear deal doesn't forbid them from testing missiles.    > The only reason ISIS exists is becaise US meddling in the region.  Nothing to do with Saudi Arabia at all? Man you turned it up from that last response.  Finally some sense in this subreddit It is entirely relevant. The settlements are the only reason why Arabs of the West Bank are being kept stateless people.  >This is simply irrelevant to the question of settlements. The question of self-determination of Arabs in Judea and Samaria is not related to the legality of settlements.  They are deeply related.  A viable Palestinian state is not possible with Israeli settlements pockmarking it and sucking up its water resources, dividing it with a wall, and crisscrossing it with settler only roads. > It is though. The 1967 are actually the 1949 armistice borders which the arabs didn't accept and started several wars over it. Thousands of people died because they didn't want to accept this borders. Now, after they lost, they are now saying we should go back to this border.   Umm no. The Arabs rejected 1947 UN partition borders which gave Israel 60% of the land despite the Jews only bring 40% of the population. Israel ended up taking 78% of the mandate, way more than the partition lines. Now the Palestinians after years of exploration and abuse are willing to live on 22% of the land which is horrendously unfair but its all they can get because that's what international law supports.    > Ann yet, all the partition plans after that have been rejected by the palestinians even though they are about 95% of the 1967 borders..  Bull shit. Palestinians have agreed  to 1967 borders with equal land swaps many many times, Israel refuses every time. With Herzog in 2014, Abbas agreed to a 4% land swap, which would give Israel control over 75% of settlers, and Netanyahu rejected it. Same with the deal with Peres in 2011, and with the Geneva Initiative in 2002 and the Taba Summit in 2001. Palestine accepts and Israel rejects. Israel only proposes deals that do not nearly compensate Palestine for the illegal annexations that Israel demands.     Israel started the 67 war by attacking Egypt.  I don't think you understand the concept.   Post WW II we decided that WW II was fucking horrible. To STOP another one we decided to follow a rule. No settlements in other countries. You can't occupy another country and settle in it. No more lebensraum. International borders ARE it. Now there are some disputed areas but wars have mostly died down. The law was actually put in place to protect Israel/Jews.   The Palestinian territories had NO Jews living in them. What has happened is that Israel has invaded those areas and encouraged settlers to move in (illegally) and seized land from Palestinians to make this happen. They have also cut up the Palestinian settlements with fences and no go areas preventing free movement of people (IF you are Palestinian).   Jerusalem is NOT all of the West Bank. The West Bank is an occupied territory, not a separate country.   That's like saying New York = America. If Israel offered all Palestinians equality.   Israel would STOP being a Jewish state. There are more Palestinians than Jews.  Israel definitely did conduct ethnic cleansing in 1948, this is a historical fact. There were still Armenians in Turkey after the genocide, but they were ethnically cleansed nonetheless.  I didn't say kill, I said ethnically cleanse. Removing an ethnicity from an area is ethnic cleansing.  We made rules after WW II to stop that. So that we don't have WW III. In WW II the policy was called Lebensraum. And the Native American ethnic cleansing in the USA is considered a horrific event. It's genocide. It's ethnic cleansing. To this day Native Americans feel the effects. It's literally ""our population needs land, yours can fuck the fuck off"".   Psst... the Treatment of Native Americans by the USA is not a good thing. In other news? The Confederate flag wasn't flown by good people.  Still, they did not attack. Closing a strait within your own sovereign waters might be illegal, but it certainly is not an attack. > I think you're ignoring Nasser sealing the straits of Tiran to israeli shipping - Israel's only port to the red sea and its only source of oil  >Nasser started the war in 1967 that day, regardless of when the actual fighting happened  So, by the same logic, when Israel blockaded Gaza, cutting off its access to not just oil, but everything from the outside world, the Israelis chose war? which is why I mentioned it might very well be a completely justified preemptive attack but saying ""the Arabs attacked again in 1967"" leaves out a lot.   Nasser was allowed to do those things and Israelis could just use any one of their other ports. Otherwise you're saying it was ok for Japan to attack us because we cut off oil to them. Israel can't just dictate casus bellis and start wars because then everybody would do it and if hey have a fuck about peacekeepers at all they cold have allowed them on their side of the border.  Israel started that war and the terrorist Menachem Begin later admitted it.   > Even if the UN hadn't accepted Israel's declaration of independence, Israel would still be a country because it is independently administers it's territory.  That's like trying to legitimize Islamic State, which interestingly enough, came to power in much the same was that Israel came to power: terrorism and ethnic cleansing.  > Does the USA only exist because the UN recognizes them or because the US military will obliterate anyone trying to impose it's sovereignty over it's territory and citizens?  I hate to break to you, sport, but the US existed BEFORE the UN. The US existed even before the League of Nations.  >> You didn't think that through, did 'ya sport?  > Apparently, you did not.  Actually, apparently I did. But you are showcasing your lack of educational achievement, so this is working out swimmingly. The one that aligned with the IDF that killed thousands of innocent Palestinian's using phosphorus gas in 2008 and Human Rights Watch called it a war crime?  Yeah that one.  https://www.hrw.org/news/2009/03/25/israel-white-phosphorus-use-evidence-war-crimes The Arab nations did not but the world did. That's why they demand that Israel withdraw in UNSC 242 and again a few weeks ago when the Security Council demanded withdrawal from Palestinian territory. Your statement that the Arabs violated an internationally recognized border in 1948 is completely fictional and you are attempting to distract from that.  It's correct because the plan was never implemented.  > Because the arabs all hate each other and wanted that slice of the pie for themselves.  Actually, no.  It was because the Arab League had endorsed Egypt's creation of the All Palestine Government, and wanted to support the Palestinians living in the West Bank and East Jerusalem to be under the same administration as the Gaza Strip, given that they, the PALESTINIANS, self-identified as a unified national ethnic group.  I mean, you've made it clear in this thread that you hate all Arabs (it's capitalized, by the way, just like Israel), but you really should do some work learning the basic history of the conflict.  It will help you frame your positions much better. California is part of a state but it was never an independent state. Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire exactly like California is part of the USA. It was not open territory like Antarctica.  Of course! You're trying to remove an entire country from history to justify the Jewish Reich.  Sounds exactly like Nazis talking about the Sudetenland. That's great but Jordan had every right to join a war to defend an ally that it had a defensive pact with.  This questions that narrative and cites its sources.  https://www.google.com.au/amp/mondoweiss.net/2014/06/understanding-still-matters/amp/  Also Peled has made clear one of the main reasons for the offensive was that Israel had mobilised so many of its young people it couldn't afford to keep them mobilised much longer without crippling the economy.  Honestly I think on the balance of things for Israel's security it was probably no bad thing that its neighbours' militaries were largely destroyed but had no real right to new territory. Thank you, this is helpful. It's a newspaper article, not a reddit comment nor a Master thesis. You don't have the space to cite every single facts contained within it. This is where the reputation of the newspaper matters. Every individual cares about themselves, but in the public care about helping greater numbers of people.   Israeli society is going through a big drama about Amona but it's really irrelevant to actual important issues that affect millions of lives. I don't care about whether it's left wing or right wing.  > don't fit his narrative  Coming from the guy who happens to have a consistent, continuing narrative, post after post. I wonder who's tailoring sources to fit their narrative ... hmmm. >As part of the new agreement, the government promised to build 52 homes and public buildings for them at two nearby locations.  Depends on where those are, then. >what we did  Are you moving out of your settler-colonial state and working to dismantle it from Europe, colonist? No, someone with an unrelenting and unthinking hatred of everything Israel does.  If removing the settlements is ethnic cleansing, do you honestly think should Israel leave them? Or do you think that they're illegal and should be removed?  The cognitive dissonance must be extreme And Israel gets a 3 billion dollars of weapons for free.  Free stuff is still saved money from public coffers. Israel is not doing the US any favors by taking it.  The delta between the totality of the west bank and the total area that was offered was .5%. Cry me a river. And as was stated before, if that offer was not sufficient, they could have made a counter offer. But they didn't do that and you don't expect them to because you hold them to lower standards. Instead, Abbas cancelled any further negotiations and flew to Cairo and you somehow think that's justified.  Sorry.  I conflated your post with the one you were replying to.  I will delete my comment.    Thanks for the heads up. The earliest claim started during the times of the Ottoman empire, not with the British.   European Zionists came to Israel as their national home after realizing that no matter how hard they'd try to assimilate in Europe, they'd always be second class citizens.  So, they set out to ""Zion"" on 1882, and during the following 20 years, 60-70 thousands migrated there.  They were actually preceded by 2500 Yemeni Zionists, who'd came several months before they did.  Rothschild, along with other donors, had bought land from the locals during Ottoman times, and 28 cities were built by the first wave of migrants during 1882-1904.  With the second wave (1904-1914) building 27 more cities, among them Tel-Aviv, which was founded on 1908.  By the time the British came, they had already laid a foundation for building a national home for themselves.   The Balfour Decleration was a recognition of the will of the Zionists to build a nation state for the Jews - it was not the first claim on the land, nor was it a British colonialist plot.  ""gain back"" just those two little words include bias.  It depends on what you mean by ""who"".  As countries go, it was part of the Ottoman Empire (where the Jews started buying private land from the ottoman landowners), and then of the British Mandate for Palestine (which included actual Jordan).  After that it was partitioned under the UN declaration and that's the last official lines because was started immediatly after as the declaration was rejected and the Arab armies invaded the day after the independence of Israel.   In the following wars, Israel declared that it annexed what is now called East Jerusalem (which has not been recognized by most countries) and occupied Gaza and the West Bank, but also some parts of Syria (which are still under control) and the Sinai (which it gave back to Egypt. Twice.). Arabs.  Arabs.  OK. I will spell it out for you: What will happen if Israel removes every non-Muslim from the West Bank? And your excuses for the closing of the strait and moving their armies to Israel's border? Bad data from Russia? Egypt makes war moves based on bad satellite data and Israel responds to these actions accordingly and you say the fault is Israel's...What you are saying is that even though Egypt made all the moves that lead to a war while their leader was calling out for the destruction of Israel, the fact that Israel fired the first shot somehow makes the entire war an ""Israeli war of aggression."" You need some history lessons and context. I prefer to be called exceptionally differently abled I'm not calling it anything, just explaining why they use it. In any case, by your argument calling it Palestine is rewriting history since it was part of Jordan before Israel took it over.  Quibbling about the name is pointless. Check the link. Construction beyond the barrier was markedly higher under Bibi than before.   >Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey have taken millions each? Europe has taken millions more? Huge efforts are being made.   That's good that nation's that have been making these efforts, just a shame that the nation's most responsible for the situation wash their hands of it.   >That has nothing to do with the nuclear deal. The nuclear deal doesn't forbid them from testing missiles.   Serious questions but what would they use such a device for? Have they got a space industry...satellites and such? What is the reason for such a project?   > It is entirely relevant  No, it is not. The settlements are either legal or illegal, and it has nothing to do with the status of other people living in the territory. After all, we are not even talking about Arab settlements.  > The settlements are the only reason why Arabs of the West Bank are being kept stateless people.   They are not ""being kept stateless"" because of settlements. They are stateless because they invaded Israel multiple times, committed despicable crimes, and when offered a state on numerous occasions (with the most left-wing PMs possible) - they refused. They can't have it both - terrorize Israel and at the same time to expect full return to the ""Green Line"".  I'm still waiting for proof by the way.  Egypt started the war by closing the Strait of Hormuz and amassing their army on the border. Huh?  that's backwards buddy > The Palestinian territories had NO Jews living in them. What has happened is that Israel has invaded those areas and encouraged settlers to move in (illegally) and seized land from Palestinians to make this happen. They have also cut up the Palestinian settlements with fences and no go areas preventing free movement of people (IF you are Palestinian).   This is 100% false. Jews were the majority in Jerusalem since at least 1882.  >https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Jerusalem#Jews_as_absolute_or_relative_majority  Jews have lived on the land for centuries.  >The first census of 1922 showed a population of 757,182, of whom 78% were Muslim, 11% Jewish and 10% Christian.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine#Demographics  So yeah, there were Jews living there *all over* the land. > The Palestinian territories had NO Jews living in them.  In 1967? Yeah, because the Jordanian and Egyptian army ran them all out in 1948. We are talking about ancient communities, Arabic-speaking Jews who wanted nothing to do with the Zionists, but were run out nonetheless.  When you say ""the Palestinian territories"" remember those were defined as the Egyptian and Jordanian lines of advance during the '48 war. >Israel definitely did conduct ethnic cleansing in 1948, this is a historical fact  Not, it didn't. Many palestinian fled, yed. But it wasn't because Israel ""ethnic cleansed"" them.  >Yoav Gelber claims that the Arab Liberation Army embarked on a systematic evacuation of non-combatants from several frontier villages in order to turn them into military strongholds.[25] Arab depopulation occurred most in villages close to Jewish settlements and in vulnerable neighborhoods in Haifa, Jaffa and West Jerusalem.[7]:99125 The poorer inhabitants of these neighborhoods generally fled to other parts of the city. Those who could afford to fled further away, expecting to return when the troubles were over.[7]:138 By the end of March 1948 thirty villages were depopulated of their Palestinian Arab population.[16]:82 Approximately 100,000 Palestinian Arabs had fled to Arab parts of Palestine, such as Gaza, Beersheba, Haifa, Nazareth, Nablus, Jaffa and Bethlehem.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestinian_exodus#December_1947_.E2.80.93_March_1948  Stop talking about shit you don't know nothing about. There is over 700,000 settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. That is the high estimate of the number of Palestinians that fled or were forced out during the 1948 war. Funny how the numbers work out like that. Nasser chose war.  They had been warned since 1957 that Israel would consider it cassus belli - starving Israel of oil would further reduce its ability to fight a future war.  That situation is untenable for any country, but especially one surrounded by enemies.    It was an attack, one meant to strangle the Israeli military in the long run by depriving them of important resources critical to running mechanized units.    Claiming such a thing is not an attack is nonsense.  This revisionist history of yours on the basis of nothing is not convincing. If gaza was a state, maybe.  And the blockade of gaza is legal.  It was raised in response to violent action from the armed terrorist group controlling gaza, Hamas. But it misleads because it omits what that a lot is, leaving it to the imagination.  Turns out that a lot also points to a self defense situation. >Nasser was allowed to do those things and Israelis could just use any one of their other ports. Otherwise you're saying it was ok for Japan to attack us because we cut off oil to them.  Cutting off someone you're already in a state of war with will not cause a war.  Cutting off someone you aren't in a state of war with will cause a war.  Does this confuse you?  > Israel can't just dictate casus bellis and start wars because then everybody would do it and if hey have a fuck about peacekeepers at all they cold have allowed them on their side of the border.   Too bad history and the law disagree with you.  >Israel started that war and the terrorist Menachem Begin later admitted it.  Very convincing.  /s You mean when they used white phosphorous as a smoke screen as permitted by international law? You need to stop with these alternate facts. Also, the racism. > The Arab nations did not but the world did. That's why they demand that Israel withdraw in UNSC 242 and again a few weeks ago when the Security Council demanded withdrawal from Palestinian territory. Your statement that the Arabs violated an internationally recognized border in 1948 is completely fictional and you are attempting to distract from that.  How can the world recognize the armistice line as a border when the parties singing the agreement are agreeing that it is not a border? The world's opinion on this is meaningless. The agreement between the parties states that the line is not a border. Period. End of story.  >Your statement that the Arabs violated an internationally recognized border in 1948 is completely fictional and you are attempting to distract from that.  Then what do you call Jordan crossing the Jordan River and invading the land on the other side? They already got their territory from the british mandate and it ended at the river. Trying to take the land on the other side of the river was a land grab. >  All Palestine Government  I thought this was just a puppet government controlled by Egypt No, not at all similar. And if you wanted to say the Ottomans were disputing the status of the land, then maybe you would have an argument.  > You're trying to remove an entire country from history to justify the Jewish Reich.  There never was a country to remove.  >Sounds exactly like Nazis talking about the Sudetenland.  Thank you Godwin! Except that ally was moving troops into position to attack. It wasn't a defensive war on Egypt's part. I really don't know how anyone can dispute the fact that Egypt closed the Straits of Tiran, an act of war, and expelled UN peacekeepers and started building up tanks and soldiers in the Sinai. What is there to dispute here? If the ""only"" thing Egypt did was block Israel's only access to the Red Sea, Israel would have been 100% justified in blowing them all to hell since that is casus belli, no argument.   And please don't use sites like mondoweiss as a source. You might as well have cited stormfront as a valid source for Jewish lizards meeting to implant mind control chips in all the world leaders.  >Honestly I think on the balance of things for Israel's security it was probably no bad thing that its neighbours' militaries were largely destroyed but had no real right to new territory.  In defensive war, which this was, territory is often captured, especially when said territory had been used by the losing side to wage their attacks and it poses an ongoing risk for them to keep control of it. That said, this territory, as I have said numerous times, was never Jordan's. It was disputed territory for the 19 years before Israel captured it, and remains disputed territory today. Perhaps your argument would hold water if the territory in question had been incorporated into a sovereign state recognized by all those disputing the territory, but as it stands now, your argument is specious, at best. The territory wasn't new. Israel had been trying to claim it since the end of the British mandate, but Jordan invaded the territory and claimed it for themselves. That doesn't make Israel an occupier or a land thief.  I agree with you regarding printed papers, but on the Internet they have the ability -- and, I'm arguing, the responsibility -- to cite a source for each fact claim. This is easily done by superscripts in the body to a collection of footnotes at the end.   It's also possible sometimes to hyperlink text to sources, which is sometimes done, but not often enough. Yeah, as I said, it's funny where that kind of political dogmatism can lead. Because it caused a huge internal political conflict within Israel, with the Israeli Attorney General going against his own government and whatnot.   And in the end, it was kinda meaningless, at least when it comes to pleasing the pro-Palestinian crowd. You guys don't really give a fuck about that, or any other specific violation of Palestinian rights, because ""individuals don't matter, as long as there's an occupation it's all evil"". If anything, Israelis policing themselves is an inconvenient deviation from the narrative, you'd rather never existed in the first place. As far as you're concerned, the settlers should just get a carte blanche to do whatever, because the settlements are already illegal, so who cares.  Now, as a left-wing Israeli, I certainly don't subscribe to that insane ideology. I'll do what's right for my country, both morally and politically. I'll just keep in mind that ""what the anti-Israeli crowd might think"" should simply not factor into these decisions. If you looked at my post you would know that almost all my sources are from Wikipedia.   Also you are acting as if having a ""consistent, continuing narrative, post after post"" is something bad lol I'm pretty sure Amona is quite deep in the West Bank, thus anywhere nearby is still in the West Bank and thus still a settlement. I'm quite sure you know this, but you ask for citations and then refute them in a display of pedanticism when you know you're on the wrong side of an argument. The difference is that we accord the indigenous population full rights. We don't identify ourselves as a ""white state"", while Israel identifies itself as a ""Jewish state"", thus excluding the indigenous population.  Can an Palestinian become the Prime Minister of Israel? No? Well, a Native American Indian can become the president of the United State because we don't discriminate against race or religion.  Correct me if I am wrong, but were you not banned recently for your racist diatribes against non-Jews? Israel is currently retroactively legalizing several thousand Jewish homes in illegal settlements, but is cleansing Palestinians from their illegal settlements.  So, yes, you should leave them and legalize them. In exchange for testing it in a hot warzone. Don't think America doesn't benefit from this (note I didn't say the American people) my point is that US weapon manufacturers lobby to get this money. > if that offer was not sufficient, they could have made a counter offer  The Palestinians DID present a counter offer, on December 18, 2008, they offered a swap of 1.9% of the West Bank and East Jerusalem in return for equal territory.  That offer was given to President Bush, in the presence of Condi Rice and National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley, to pass on to the Israelis.  There were also several meetings between the September 2008 offer Olmert made and the January 2009 Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip between PA negotiators and Shalom Turgeman, Tzipi Livni and Tal Becker representing Israel.  Stop lying. No, they are descriptive.   The fact that people who once lived in one place want back in is objective.   I am talking of very personal ownership / inhabitance not political rule.   Israel also wishes to ""gain back"" what was lost, just over a longer timespan.  Thanks for the reply. I'm wondering specifically about individual land ownership, though. For instance, my grandfather purchased his farmland in the U.S. from the previous owner, and received deeds to the land. (the example starting with the Ottoman Empire seems more akin to the British taking over the land that would become the colonies, etc. But it's not a description of what individual person owned the land.)Does my questions make sense? Sorry, I'm having trouble wording it. The partition was only proposed, not accepted by all parties. It was zionists unilaterally implementing it by force that started the civil war and when they started cleansing arab villages the Arabs intervened a month later. The following wars in 1956 and 1967 were **started by Israel** making anything they annexed conquest.   Egypt moved its troops due to Soviet data. That's not my opinion, that's the opinion of historians. Israel didn't know Egypt's intention and decided to launch pre-emptive war because it had spies who discovered the location of the entire Egyptian Air Force and they took their shot, which drastically shortened the war.   I'm not saying that Israel didn't have reason to fear a potential invasion, or that it was an Israeli war of aggression, but it was certainly not an Arab war of aggression against Israel.  Ok then *they're* the ones rewriting history. Jordan is a fake country created by churchill on a cocktail napkin.   > That's good that nation's that have been making these efforts, just a shame that the nation's most responsible for the situation wash their hands of it.  So the USA doesn't do shit to help Palestine and doesn't do shit to help Syria. What's your point again? Where is the hypocrisy?    > Serious questions but what would they use such a device for? Have they got a space industry...satellites and such? What is the reason for such a project?  For both military and space purposes. The most important reason is because It is an effective missile delivery weapon to attack enemies who are far away.  Okay so your argument is that the ENTIRE Palestine Mandate territory AKA Israel + current Palestine should belong to Israeli hands.   Okay let's agree on that.   Should the Muslims living in Palestine and those displaced by Israel not be allowed to return home and be given Israeli citizenship then?   I mean if we are talking about Israel as this shining symbol of equality and what have you. Then why not give everyone (Yep. Hamas included) equal rights. Let them vote. Let them run for power. Let them get equal access. Break down the walls and so on and let the refugees go home.   I mean if Israel was all that and hot toast it would have no problems in doing that?   Or do you not see the rank fucking hypocrisy in maintaining another population as second class citizens.  And Israel ran out Palestinians in 1948. The rules were put in place after that and I think everyone should be entitled to go home.   The 1948 war was when the UN declared the border. Israel took the West Bank and Gaza in 1967.   I repeat. Should the people captured in 1967 and displaced throughout not be allowed to return home and be given equal rights in their home land? Or are Jews the only people who are allowed to return to historic homelands and the only acceptable claim to a homeland is based on tenuous grasps of theology rather than having actually lived there? I know the facts, I don't share your denialist perspective.  You should read the rest of that wikipedia article, and then maybe some actual sources.   Even if we believe that all the 'evacuations' were always voluntary, though, we still have ethnic cleansing. If people run away from their homes because they justifiably believe they're at risk of ethnic violence, and you bar them from returning to their homes because of their ethnicity, that's ethnic cleansing.  Good observation. There was no state of war at the time. Prove that history and the law disagree if you can otherwise fuck off with the bullshit.   Oh god please tell me more about this racism while I talk about a national government.  Stop it.  It's like calling everyone Hitler, it loses value and when the new Trump shows up no one will believe you.  Stop crying wolf.  Edit: get BiBi's dick out of your mouth. ""Israel's repeated firing of white phosphorus shells over densely populated areas of Gaza during its recent military campaign was indiscriminate and is evidence of war crimes""  (Link in my post above) If the USA was dissolved then china would not have  the right to take whatever land it wanted in California while denying rights to all non-Chinese Californians who live there.  No it wasn't. There isn't a single mainstream historian who believes that Egypt was moving troops to the border with an intent to invade. If you want to please the pro-Palestinian crowd then oppose settlement expansion. This is an irrelevant case which actually serves to legitimize settlement expansion by furthering the myth that there are such things as legal settlements.  > A close minded person is the one that rejects sources because they don't fit his narrative.  >Also you are acting as if having a ""consistent, continuing narrative, post after post"" is something bad lol  Alternatively, I'm concerned about factual accuracy and very wary of being blindsided by ""fake news"" that agrees with my preconceived biases.  Don't be so lackadaisical about your information. Truth is important. >Can an Palestinian become the Prime Minister of Israel? No?  The answer is actually yes. A Palestinian citzen of Israel could (at least in theory), be elected Prime Minister. About 20% of Israeli citzens are Arab, the majority of whom identify as Palestinian. Currently 17 members of the Knesset are Arab.    Obviously though of course, the issue is Palestinians who *dont* have Israel citzenship. Complicating matters is that many don't particularly want it and have, in fact, rejected its offer in the past. A one-state solution could resolve this, but it would also mean the de facto death of both the dream of an Independent Palestinian state, and also the existence of a majority Jewish state. Pick your poison, but at least educate yourself if you are going to choose a side in a 100 year ethnic war. So your settler-colonial state is OK if, after you genocide the natives into irrelevance, you give the survivors full rights? No reparations needed?  A Palestinian with Israeli citizenship (90% of all Israeli-Arabs, who are 20% of the Israeli population) can become the Prime Minister.   I was temporarily banned from a different subreddit by anti-Israel mods who resented the fact that I claimed (and linked proof) that a sizable number of Palestinian individuals are deeply antisemitic. The tragic irony is that those same mods refused to apply the same restriction to another poster who claimed (and did not link proof) that a sizable number of Israeli individuals are racist.  That whole controversy took place in the subreddit's modmail. Which mod are you a sockpuppet for? I bet I know. Amona is a jewish settlement, not only are you an anitsemite, you also have no reading comprehension.

"6",5,"5r95mk","2017-01-31","that's kind of a win for Trump isn't it? I work in international trade (in the U.S.), and NAFTA has a lot of loopholes.     For instance, many companies import goods (shirts, packaging, electronics, etc.) from Asian countries.  They will then cut what is known as a T&E Bond (Transport and Export) which allows cargo to move within the U.S. without clearing Customs.     This cargo will get shipped to a factory in Mexico (duty free, as it's considered a temporary import to MX), and the factory in Mexico will stitch/print a logo or a minimal design.  Then, the product is sent back into the U.S.... and STILL no duties/taxes are paid, because it is now a ""Mexican"" good.     Bullshit.  They were manufactured in Asia.  Companies do this ALL THE TIME.  And our government is losing out on duties/taxes we SHOULD be collecting, due to NAFTA.     Figured this wouldn't be well known to a lot of people. This is exactly what his base wants  Nafta was devised before the internet really took off.  It's in dire need of an update, regardless of what the politicians make of it. Most Mexicans today care more about the coming gasoline price rise on Feb 5th, than if Mexico stays or not in NAFTA.  NAFTA in Mexico benefits a 1% clic and its minnions, paying dirt cheap wages for export.   NAFTA helped USA products, pushed off Mexican products in Mexicos stores.  They will be missed but today thanks to NAFTA, Mexico products are more competative than before; and can easy as pie fill the gap.  Mexico will not die because NAFTA is gone.   Its not a isolated little island like Cuba was.   Mexico can survive a post NAFTA world. umm poor mexicans were against NAFTA in the first place. it fucked over the little people and gave power to big agro and commercial farms...i guess you could say they are waking up...getting woke LOL.  Mexicans have  been against NAFTA since day 1.  Unless you mean the few rich mexicans who own the factories taking advantage of peasant farmers forced off their land by subsidized corn.. Mexico got kinda screwed by NAFTA--or did you think all those displaced migrant workers suddenly came out of nowhere?   I actually wrote an essay on NAFTA if anyone is interested.   http://docdro.id/9TAxFRh Well because Mexico got the short end of the stick in NAFTA. But Americans are stupid enough to believe otherwise.  NAFTA has always been the black beast of certain Mexicans (especially the left), who blame it for having destroyed the Mexican agricultural sector. That is right: what in the US is considered ""white nationalism"" is Mexico is considered liberal progressivism. They are mad because they finally learned what type of a person they work for. NAFTA devastated many sectors of the Mexican economy, not just the small farmers who couldn't compete with Big American Agra. Small industries in Mexico didn't have the access to capital to modernize and compete. Family small businesses that made things like shoes for generations were swept away.  To hit the reset button now after so many Mexicans lost out so others could get ahead is beyond insulting. Its a bad deal and renders any future deal as worthless. NAFTA destroyed mexico and ruined the mexican farming industry. It made ordinary mexicans into beggars who had to flee their country for opportunity while fake ""mexicans"" like vicente fox and the mostly white/european mexican elite made out like bandits.   The biggest losers of NAFTA were the mexican and american people. The biggest winners were the wealthy elite.  That's the point of NAFTA and ""free"" trade. Beggaring your local populace so that the elite/capital could get free access to each other's markets.   Many American jobs are connected to our exports to mexico.

NAFTA is riddle with issues for both Mexico and the US. No one party is benefitting unilaterally. I think the general consensus is getting more out of NAFTA than Mexico but it doesn't really matter at this point: its hurting both countries in different ways.  The US is Mexico's #1 trade partner, Mexico is the US's #3 trade partner as well, Mexico is not unilaterally dependant on the US and the US is not independent from Mexico, cooperation will be necessary, even if trade ties are cut coordinated policy *will* be necessary.  Never give up a free chance at anything, never give anything free up without a good reason, to throw away the chance to negotiate is a waste of a good chance. Good luck renegotiating that better deal now that you've completely pissed off the entire nation you wanted to deal with.  ITT: People who don't understand what NAFTA is and the consequences if Mexico (or the US) pulls out of it.  Hope everyone here who is cheering them on for considering leaving isn't going to complain when prices hike up for products people buy everyday.  I have no idea what this is but I love guessing what abbreviations stand for: is it North American Free Trade Agreement? Good, I hope the Mexicans rip NAFTA to shreds. Trump is a billionaire he has to be doing this on purpose. I believe the guy just feeds on chaos.  Most of you don't realize just how beneficial NAFTA is to all three countries, including the US. That's why Trump wanted to ""re-negotiate"" NAFTA rather than pull out of it.   I swear most of you idiots are poorly educated. This is news? Interview a few random people in the streets? He's still president?  Wtf Isn't that what Trump wants?  A removal of NAFTA? Umm, mission accomplished? Well everyone else already hated mafya so welcome to the club 5D snakes and ladders What if Mexico ended or at least curtailed its culture of corruption?  NAFTA wouldn't matter.    If corruption weren't so widespread, Mexico would be so prosperous that trade with the US would be an afterthought. um... 12d chess? They're basically cutting of their nose to spite the face. Just knowing that there will be this kind of news gives me a lot of anxiety when visiting Reddit every morning. Ok.  I'm good with it Yeah, NO comparison to illegals as slaves since they are here willingly and Mexican citizens depending on US dollars just crutches their corrupt regime along. Yeah, nothing to see here, move along. I've been somewhat wondering if that hasn't been part of the plan. Let's face it, the pro-business wing of the Republican Party generally really likes NAFTA. They're probably powerful enough to get Congress to keep from killing it. (Or at least make it very, very difficult for Trump to do so.)  But, if he can antagonize Mexico enough to get them towithdraw on their own, then he doesn't need Congress. He can have Mexico do his work for him.   I loathe and despise Trump, but I'm suspicious he's a clever, cagey mofo who knows how to get what he wants. Not really. It's like the dog that caught the car. Americans actually live NAFTA, they just don't know why.  Without it, they'll find out quickly. Tell that to the rust belt that depends on trade with Mexico, some 5-6 millions jobs depend on Exports to Mexico. Too bad they voted for Trump... Mexico withdrawing from NAFTA?  LOL.  That would be a wet dream for Trump.  How is that a win for Trump?  Wasn't he going to use that to try to strong arm Mexico into paying for the wall? There are tons of Americans working in Canada and Mexico (and vice versa) under the NAFTA legislation. I thought he wanted to create more jobs. Not destroy the ones that already exist? Damn pre-empt trump and shut the border down for anyone other than people. Let trump come to you to beg to open the border and use his desperation to force him to create agreements that worked for Mexico. Also to tell him he is paying for the wall and not America. Politically in the short term? Big time.  Realistically in the mid-long term? It's an enormous mistake that may not be able to be fully corrected for years.  If US-Mexico trade suffers, the US and Mexico suffers. The asinine idea that Mexico is taking advantage of the poor, naive US is right up there with other Trump greats such as CFLs cause cancer, Asbestos is 100% safe, Vaccines cause autism, and many, many more (look them up, don't trust an Internet stranger, no matter how sexy his tractor is). It is and I'm not (sick of winning). There are a lot of issues with NAFTA. It's decades old and wasn't well designed. During its drafting there was a lot of critcsm, but it passed because they wanted a deal.  It can do a lot better for everyone. I'm curious where you feel this line should be drawn. How much does one need to alter a product for it to be considered a product of that country?   There are plenty of US companies who also import goods and further manufactur/modify them here, only to export them to MX/CA. Shouldn't this also be taken into account in this consideration? I knew of an outfit that made parts for ford. The parts would get shipped to mexico, shipped back, worked on by US workers, shipped to mexico, and shipped back. I am not sure what was being circumvented but somehow that was all cheaper. Lots of consumer electronics companies boat kits into Mexico and assembled goods out of Mexico. They'll play whatever game is the most profitable.   I do believe that there may be a better deal out there for the US also. Things have changed in the 23 years since NAFTA was signed.   GM was the 1# Fortune 100 company that year.  So there's been a titanic shift since then. Could they not just ship it directly to Mexico from china Art Vandelay? Is that you? I didn't know that, thank you! There was an article regarding this about aluminum last year     [WSJ Article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-billionaire-linked-to-giant-aluminum-stockpile-in-mexican-desert-1473356054)  I think this is the kind of thing that needs to be fixed. But also it has very little to do with what Trump has been saying his issues are with NAFTA, mainly that Mexico is unfairly benefitting over the US. This isn't an issue of NAFTA , it's an issue of fraudulent companies not adhering to rules of origin. Bingo. Have you seen anybody using incorrect HS Codes to skirt duty as well?  I don't think his base realizes how the agreements in place already favor the U.S. These agreements were put in place before China was huge trade partner, not to mention an opportunity to place future rival economies, UK and the EU in a position where they compete with one another for trade deals, or that the certain countries in S. America are very much open to free trade. What it basically means is that the U.S. doesn't have much leverage this time round of negotiations.   Despite almost a year to explain how he would negotiate better trade deals, the Cheeto President was only held accountable for saying the same red-blooded slogans over and over again. Never mind that there are videos of him saying the exact opposite, there were enough morons that bought the bullshit because he gave it to them in a pretty wrapper.  They only think they want that. They dont understand nafta or realize how balanced to our favor it really is.  Great. Many people have said this, but HOW does it need to be updated? The details are VERY IMPORTANT here. Every single person can ramble on and on about how NAFTA ""needs an update"", but it means NOTHING if nobody actually articulates what needs to change. More tariffs? No tariffs? More regulations? Less regulations? Which regulations? Which goods need to be regulated? Should goods be treated differently? Not a single one of these questions has been honestly discussed, but they desperately NEED to be. > Nafta was devised before the internet really took off.  protectionism makes even less sense in a post-internet world. But Also Gore helped with NAFTA, and he invented the internet Thanks Trump.  EVERYONE besides people working in banking, intellectual property, and the chemicals industry, so basically 75% of people, should have been against NAFTA from day 1.  Care to explain? Everything is awesome. Everything is cool when you're part of the team. Everything is awesome. When you're living the [American] dream. ^Actual ^American ^dream ^sold ^separately ^many ^restrictions ^apply.  It's really poor people getting the shaft for the benefit of the wealthy. It's the essence of free trade. Free trade is the essence of capitalism. It's hilarious that the so called left who tend to lean socialist and communist are suddenly hardcore exploitative capitalists. But we live in era of disinformation and distortion so it's no surprise.  For anyone wondering. The point of globalization/free trade is to allow multinational corporations to exploit the cheapest labor markets around the world duty free. In order to exploit a Mexican labor market American labor necessarily has to move south of the border. Mass immigration serves a similar purpose for jobs that can't be outsourced.   The real left has always been against these free trade agreements because they have been recognized since their inception as what they were intended to be - an attack on the working class and the labour movement.  There's a reason these deals never included minimum labour standards, minimum wages etc.  It was so the capitalist class could exploit the third world for bigger profit margins.  Ironically, the hated TPP was the first one of these types of agreements that included labour protections, protections that would have been added to NAFTA since all three NAFTA countries were on board for TPP. All NAFTA did was get American corporations richer and has stagnated most American's income for the last 35 years.  Indeed, there was an [armed rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapatista_Army_of_National_Liberation) by the EZLN in southern Mexico the day that NAFTA came into affect.   This is so true. When nafta went through everyone knew companies would make record breaking profits and workers would get laid off. But we were going increase taxes and public services to make up for it as well as invest the new found wealth into education so that our next generation of citizens would be fully prepared for the 21st centuary job market.   Then the second part never happened and we all wonder why our citizens are so dumb we have to import brains from Asia and Europe. Meanwhile there are no jobs for the US citizens because all the decent brain free jobs are in Mexico. nafta didn't ""destroy us"" if anything I saw my life improve.  Guess where those jobs are located? It rhymes with Must Pelt.  Yes, they went away with NAFTA. Why do you think wages today are the same for most Americans as they were around 1970. NAFTA is terrible for most Americans. Some are saying that NAFTA benefited only the wealthy elites. Not normal Mexicans or Americans. So, it might be better for the common folk.  Then again, I'm no expert. I'm just a guy with some popcorn. Corporations moved manufacturing jobs from the US ($20-45 an hour) to Mexico ($3 hr) and charged American consumers the same prices. Or even increased prices. Fuck these corporations and them exploiting workers.  Price hikes and job losses that far outstrip anything that NAFTA pulled off.  It'll be horrid and these people have no idea what they're wishing for. Never Ask For The Abreviation Winner winner chicken dinner we won't.  If Trump really wants to renegotiate instead of just trashing the whole thing he is already doing a terrible job. Last time I checked pissing off the country you are trying to negotiate with isn't the best way to get what you want, and 2 years of telling the world how Mexico is full of criminals and rapists who he will magically force to pay for his wall is certainly not going to make all the Mexicans who hate Trump want to give him anything.  Beneficial to those in charge and those who own factories and farms.  Not beneficial to anyone who works for them. And he will be for the next couple of years...  ...  What? You think anybody will do anything about it? And this is how u look dumb. I live in America and don't know any trump supporters. Oh wait he's pres now. You and your circle aren't Mexico. Maybe the report is wrong but saying I live here and I don't know a person blah blah shut up  You don't have to like him , but he didn't get to where he is by being a stupid. People who think that he's stupid just aren't paying attention.  And being smart doesn't mean that you have to like him or think he's a good person.  But look at what has happened since he took office.  The Protests of his Inauguration are all over TV, so he has his Press Secretary issue a ridiculous statement that his Inauguration was the most attended ever, followed by 'Alternative Facts.'  He caused a wave of discord in the media by coming out and saying that there were 3-5 Million illegal votes for Hillary, everyone went crazy over that, meanwhile, he starts Keystone XL and DAPL back up and noone even notices.  He delivered on his promise to freeze the refugee influx and did it with a list of countries that was created by the Obama Administration so that when it comes time to fight it out with Democrats, he can pull their voting records on the Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 to make them look bad to possible constituents. Plus, everyone is so hot about the travel ban that his SCOTUS pick will sail right through.      He might be right, he might be wrong, he might be good, he might be evil, but he's not stupid.  Most of his 'crazy' moves are misdirection, Magician style, so that his haters miss what he is actually doing.   How much more winning does he have to do before people realize he knows what he is doing? You're seeing the combination of Trump's braggadocio and populist rhetoric with Steve Bannon's cunning. It's a scary mix.  It is really difficult to believe that an illiterate crass jerk like trump is cagy, rather it is most likely president bannon that is running the show and laughing as every shock event he creates using his cardboard cutout creates havoc and confusion [Balanced view with pros and cons explained](http://www.cfr.org/trade/naftas-economic-impact/p15790).   My opinion is, while NAFTA (and a dozen other federal programs and treaties) have their upsides, are they the best they could possibly be? Obama and Sanders supported reworking NAFTA, so to me it seems like there is agreement it can be improved.   As for how, that's another matter which, to my knowledge, none of the three elaborated on in detail. We will see.   One example i have is how mossberg shotguns are machined in Mexico to exploit cheaper labor and then assembled in the us and then stamped made in the usa. Similar business tactics are used with many us manufacturers thanks to Nafta. It's cheaper to under pay mexicans than it is to pay us workers thanks to agreements like nafta Oh, I know that but Trump says it's the worst trade agreement ever and wants to do away with or change it.  thats a two way street. my family *lived* NAFTA. my father, uncle, brother and me were farmers.  key word were.  nafta passed and we all had doubts and the first  3 years it was tough.  after the 4 year mark the purpose for tariffs, regulations and red tape nafta enacted became clear.  mostly two types survived, the big internationals that moved shop to ship from china and those that raked in the subsidies on the home turf.   at the end of the line thats what nafta did, made it cheaper to produce/manufacture and ship from overseas.     You do realize mexico is one of the top 3 importers and exporters to the US right? That's a lot of money going to and from the US. It's gonna greatly affect the average American if mexico pulled out or whatever.  It's the worst possible scenario for him. It means Mexico does something to *him* instead of vice versa. It's similar to when the MexPrez cancelled the meeting. He couldn't have it, so he had to say they both cancelled it. Does he really think he can out-machismo the Mexicans? But would be a nightmare for Americans and Texans especially. No, his brilliant plan is to tax American consumers. Wowzers! who knows, I think NAFTA and paying for the wall were separate ideas in Trumps little brain.  >I thought he wanted to create more jobs.   at home, he wanted to create more jobs **at home** I know some people who went down to Mexico to train people how to do their jobs before they got shitcanned. But he can say ""look even Mexico knows it's a bad deal"" then go on saying that they're paying the wall and his supporters can coo and preen like they understand something. If I recall, There were 2 NAFTA's - the other one being North American  FAIR trade agreement.  I think that one wasn't backed by a Republican house and so the FREE trade agreement was the one that got passed.     But Trump IS right (broken clock is right twice a day?) in that the current iteration of NAFTA is a bad deal.  But it should be amended and fixed, not just ripped away in a knee jerk reaction. To answer your first question: I think the line should be drawn at where the the primary function/intent of use is manufactured.  If I am importing printed product packaging from China, and all Mexico is doing is stamping a logo on it, it's a Chinese made good.     In your example, the U.S. company would still pay duty/tax on the materials; but, to answer the question: if a U.S. company imports *blank* shirts from China, and then prints them, dies them, or maybe frays/destroys them for a certain look - I would consider the ""value"" of the shirt being added by the U.S. company, and when they export that product, it should be treated as a U.S. made good.     There is actually a large book released every year by U.S. Customs called the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) that actually details this.     To be clear, my issue is that companies are dodging duty/taxes on the initial import to the U.S. by moving them straight to Mexico (i.e., they don't clear U.S. customs before moving to Mexico, which they should in my opinion). You don't need to draw any line. Just base the tax on the difference in price. Was there a 3rd country involved other than Mexico and the U.S.?  Otherwise that actually just sounds like NAFTA working as intended.  Mexico has cheaper labor & factories so it's common for this to happen and is what NAFTA was intended for, so companies aren't paying duties/taxes on product going back and forth.  The issue is straight duty/tax evasion. To add a wrinkle to that, they actually don't ship direct into Mexico.  Since Mexico is a heavy manufacturing country, they actually have really high duty/tax rates for Asian goods.  So, companies ship kits/parts to the U.S., and move them as I stated in my original post.  U.S. company ends up paying 0 duty/taxes, Mexican companies pay 0 duty/taxes, Asia makes money, Mexico makes money, U.S. company has a higher profit margin, consumer loses. In theory, yes - however, Mexican customs doesn't have a bonded transport function like the U.S.  They actually require all inbound shipments to be cleared through customs at their port of entry, so the Mexican company would be duty/tax.     This is why they ship to the U.S. first, move it to Mexico (oh hey it's from the U.S. - NAFTA!), do the re-work etc. in Mexico, then ship it back to the U.S. (oh hey it's from Mexico - NAFTA!) Haha - just started watching Seinfeld again too! Yeah this is very illegal. I work in international trade in the US and there's no way we would do this.  As it stands, this is NOT considered fraudulent.  Since there is work being done in Mexico, the good becomes ""Mexican"".  It's a legal loophole and is an issue with NAFTA. Occasionally.  I work with either brand new importers, or VERY large companies.  The large companies are under scrutiny so they can't do it.  And new importers are so inexperienced, my company usually classifies for them (and it's a large global 3PL so we are super strict about compliance).     The biggest issues I've seen are importer who import goods subject to CVD/ADD regulations, and they try to use a different HS code to avoid those rates. It was intended to benefit all 3 countries. If Mexico shuts it down, it hurts Mexico at least as much (and probably a lot more) as the US. In fact, one of the intentions of the deal was to assist the developing Mexican economy and stem the tide of illegal immigrants coming over the border.  In some ways, the plan succeeded. For example, it allowed the American auto industry to compete with the asian market. In other ways, it failed. Jobs and crops were lost to Mexican agriculture and cheap labor (at the time of institution, Mexicans income was about 30 percent of Americans).  The estimated impact on the US GDP was approximately 0.5% for the positive, but that doesn't necessarily mean everything is great. Some people argue that a big reason college diplomas are necessary for job opportunity in the country is the fact that High-school-educated and below credentials compete directly with the low-income Mexican labor market.  Renegotiating NAFTA to fix some of the problems and loopholes is not a bad thing, but terminating it is. While it is an interesting thought to state that the US does not have much power in this negotiation, I would posit that historically the US has been better-developed and far more wage-stable than Mexico (Canadian trade is still protected by the agreement pre-NAFTA in 1988 if I am not mistaken). Because the US has greater export volume, market variety, and economic presence outside of the continental North America, I believe the US actually has far more  power than Mexico does in this particular case. Because the American people can't understand anything outside of the 30 second clips they hear on their local echo chamber.   It's a sad day when someone did a study of people sharing online content and found that clickbait titles were more often to be shared without reading the underlying content than they were likely to be read first, then shared.   Example:  WOW THIS ONE WEIRD POST GREW MY KARMA COUNT BY 50000000. MODS HATE HIM!  Tl;dr it's easier to point a finger and say ""this is bad"" then when a politician blows it up and says ""i killed the bad"" the fool can be happy, rather than realize they may lose their preexisting condition healthcare... for example.  Ironically, one of the largest places where NAFTA needs updating is IP law. And IP law (and the enforcement thereof) was the main concern of TPP. Perhaps THINGS like this should BE decided by PEOPLE more knowledgeaBLE in the subject THAN random teenagers ON THE iNtErNeT??? > protectionism  Let me stop paying taxes and obeying federal, state and local laws and I'll stop leaning towards protectionism.

Las importaciones de maz blanco y amarillo, con mnimos aranceles de 3% y 1% respectivamente, estn arruinando a los productores netamente comerciales del noroeste que no pueden vender, pero tambin desvalorizan los excedentes de los milperos ms modestos y desalientan incluso la produccin de autoconsumo, dejando un saldo de alrededor de tres millones de productores damnificados. La agroindustria caera azucarera est en crisis, pues Estados Unidos no acepta las importaciones pactadas, alegando otros acuerdos, mientras que el edulcorante de alta fructosa desplaza al azcar de caa como insumo de los refrescos embotellados.

Si a esta debacle general agropecuaria agregamos el desmantelamiento de la caficultura campesina, que sustenta a cerca de 400 mil productores, y considerando pizcas da de comer a unos tres millones de personas, habr que reconocer que estamos ante una emergencia mxima[3].  This is from the first link and does a pretty good job of highlighting problems agriculturally. NAFTA/TLCAN wasn't just all fun and games for the Mexicans. Also, the mexican economy rose during this time period but so did the American economy.   Not OP, but just had a link for this.  ill give you another reason states like Sinaloa, Chihuahua, and Durango had an insane jump in GDP...heres a hint ...it aint corn and beans I think most people have been against NAFTA since the beginning.  I know it was really unpopular and Clinton teamed up with the Republicans over his own party to force it through. im in favor of nafta and im not part of any of those.  Mexico sacrificed their agricultural economy (their backbone) to facilitate some manufacturing jobs that did nothing to make up for the shipping of their agri-econ heading to the US.  Mexicans crossing the border were result of US agribusiness competing and crushing small family farms in Mexico.  A lot of those people in the US having a shitty time still live comfortable lives compared to what would be happening to them in some third world countries.  I'm incredibly disappointed on so many levels with this country but one thing I do not take for granted is how easy it is for us to have our basic needs met here. Lol these trade treatys are how the rich and powerful that fuck us over expand the fucking to other countries.  Can't tell if joke, or serious. NAFTA has only been around since 1994. It's been around ~23 years, so how is it responsible for wage stagnation over a 35 year period? That's why the wealthy elite pushed for NAFTA. NAFTA wasn't invented by the working class. It was created of the wealthy, by the wealthy, for the wealthy.   It's crazy when people pretend that the wealthy created NAFTA for the benefit of the regular folk... This is actually quite interesting. The more you know, eh? I'm sure if you try harder, you'll be able to graduate. Don't sell yourself short.  All the people downvoting me probably think the wealthy spent all that time and money creating NAFTA because the wealthy elite care about the poor and middle folk...   Wealthy people do things ultimately to make themselves money. NAFTA wasn't created by the workers and the ordinary people. It was created by the wealthy elite in all three countries to have free reign at exploiting the people...  This is the reason people fear UBI and its promises. The people in charge can pull the plug at any time, and they have no reason to continue it. The racial issues within mexico and the rest of latin america is very interesting for sure.   Most mestizos have significant native blood ( more than spanish/european ). It's very odd to see them shit on their own people/ancestors. Bust Relt? Its amazing for most Americans.  NAFTA reduced the price of goods for your average American by a decent margin. Without NAFTA manufacturing jobs would still be dead and we'd be paying more for every day goods.  Why don't people understand that? 3/hr???? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, More like 4 dollars per day. 3 dollars an hour in mexico is a good salary for a poor person. enough to buy a house.  We're edging closer and closer to ""Idiocracy"". At the end of the day it's not the peasants or street vendors that make the decisions. It's the corporate elite. Short of a revolution, I believe Mexico will come to the table.  Not really. NAFTA makes it easier for employers and employees to work in one of the three countries. I know few Canadians who have opened up businesses in the States as well as some who have moved here from the States to work, all thanks to NAFTA. It's not only factories and farms. Other than having a meltdown and staging protests everytime he sneezes? Probably not. People joke about Trump playing nD chess, but he's smarter than he sounds. If you pick apart the Manning tweet it's a masterpiece. The left has branded him as a childish buffoon, this helps him even further. He has learned to play the media like no one in recent history. What people see as fumbles have purposeful intent. His spelling mistakes even fit that model. They won't admit that to themselves, it's too late.  Based on some previous presidents I don't know why people think competency is a prerequisite to becoming one. It's a great mix.  That's fine, but the issue (well, *an* issue) is that Trump has made enemies of the other negotiating party where previously he had allies. Or rather Bush and Obama had allies, but same thing. Trying to renegotiate NAFTA is a little bit like trying to constantly renegotiate a prenup with your spouse. It might not be perfect, but the benefits of revisiting it is not worth the damage to the relationship. > are they the best they could possibly be?  Of course NAFTA isn't the best it could possibly be - there are multiple countries involved!  It's a negotiation.  A compromise.    What's best for the US, isn't necessarily what's best for Canada or Mexico.  So, the US gave up something here and there to get what they wanted in other areas.  As did Canada.  As did Mexico.  Canada would never ratify a NAFTA that was best for the US.  The US would never have ratified one that was best for Canada.  It's insane that Trump could think that he can just pull out of the agreement - and then somehow negotiate a better deal for his country.  Canada and Mexico will be looking to do that too.  Just like it was insane for Brexiters to think that they could just pull out of the EU and magically negotiate a better deal for themselves. Except he's antagonized Mexico so much that nothing good will come of renegotiating NAFTA now. He could've strong armed a better deal but not with how far he's taken things. Renegotiating NAFTA to give America a better deal and Trump the excuse to claim that Mexico has in fact paid for the wall would be political (and maybe even literal) suicide for Enrique Pea Nieto. He would never do it at this point. Everyone supports reworking NAFTA, including the Canadians. Problem is each side what's to change different things. Canada wants to increase softwood lumber, Mexico wants to protect their agricultural sector and prevent their companies from being bought up by Americans, America wants an end to outsourcing and... a Wall? Each country profits and losses from NAFTA in different ways.    Oh sure, everyone would want to renegotiate NAFTA, but in what business school do they tell you to disrespect the client and piss them off? How is Trumps behavior helping at all?  backing out of a deal is a different problem from evaluating the deal's merits, due to path dependence.   that nafta exists and existed for all these years means that supply chains are configured with nafta(and the low tariffs even prior to nafta) in mind. so disruption to nafta would bring about pretty severe supply chain disruption.  You can't rework NAFTA if Mexico drops out. It will become a completely different trade agreement, with the only neighbor we haven't pissed off enough. And despite internet stereotype, Canada ain't a pushover. They know well enough that if Mexico holds true to their word to drop NAFTA that they have leverage to negotiate the parts of the old trade deals they didn't like and turn them in their favor. The problem is, no working class person who feels they lost their job because of NAFTA is going to read all that, though, but they're still going to vote... TPP was NAFTA's improvement. And in many ways, from the perspective of the left, it indeed was. But democrats and republicans couldn't help their own stupidity in this subject.  > are they the best they could possibly be?   perfect is the enemy of good I hope it's still possible to renegotiate NAFTA.  It seems as if US/Mexico relations has a lot of animosity to work through which could hinder any deal making. Interesting. So without Mexico, there will be an ammo and gun shortage and prices will rise?  May be time to invest in some arms and ammunition. If they were not made in Mexico then those companies would just ship the jobs off to China.   Toward the end of the campaign Clinton was trashing NAFTA as well even though her husband ratified it. That was an interesting change of opinion to me.  I think we have to come to terms that anything Trump says is garbage. It's either the best or the worse, there is no indication of a thought process that might have been there to form a balanced opinion. And then there is the lies and wild accusations. The next four years are going to be such a shit show.  uh...you understand NAFTA benefited American farmers, right?  It destroyed Mexican farmers because they can't compete with American  big ag.     and then you start talking about China which has NOTHING to do with NAFTA.  you literally couldn't be more wrong.   Nothing you said related to farmers. Are you saying that farming went to China? That doesn't make any sort of sense.  I do believe some issues have hurt small farmers but a lot of that is also tied up in cronyism that helps the bigger guy through many subsidies and other factors out side of NAFTA. Just pulling out of NAFTA would cause insane consequences. I don't think it would help you get back into farming. I think the best thing for some smaller farms is the holistic, farm to table movement. I also believe a level playing field between big and small farmers needs to be looked at, but it's not just in the hands of NAFTA itself.        Honest thoughts?       PS I'm open to being wrong and having differing opinions, unlike 90% of Americans today it seems like.  Are you Mexican?  NAFTA gutted small farming in Mexico so if it did the same in the U.S. (if you're American) then how did it end up lowering food prices in both countries? I am curious as to how farmers were affected. Articles about the TPP state that it would have been good for farmers in the US because it allowed them to export their surplus, of which they had a lot. Is this not the same with NAFTA? Please elaborate  Our supermarkets would be fucking bare.  Texan here.  I wish Trump would stop pissing off our amigos to the south. This! I know that there is no way Mexico would pay for that, so the logical solution will be to pass the cost to the people as a taxation, claiming that he will make a reinburst when mexico pays for everything. I don't know if I am just missing something really obvious here...but I thought Trump wanted a new trade deal with Mexico, and he was going to use that as leverage to get Mexico to pay for the wall.  I don't understand how hating Trump and wanting no trade with the US is a win. Are the US companies not dodging the same initial import duty/taxes of the country's they are exporting to?   To add to that, there is not much difference between the value added in your two examples. If they are embroidering the shirt, that is likely whrre the value is added to the item.   The core difference is really the movement through the US, to which they pay the applicable bond fees. If they imported direct to Mexico, the example would be identical and the US would miss out on that additional revenue. (I'm guessing that the duty to import to Canada and then store/transport the shirts is less than what it would cost to direct import to Mexico in this case.) I'm a little confused.  You think it's not okay to stamp a product that isn't a shirt, but if they're stamping shirts that's okay?  I'm in manufacturing.. is printing on a shirt just harder than I think it is? Interestingly enough, I'm in California and pollution is pretty Damn bad. They don't talk about it much anymore and air quality may be better than previous decades but there is a significant yellow brown haze over the air LA to SD.   The state bludgeons Trump over the head about climate change while being the largest polluter.   Yes, I realize California has energy and fuel efficiency laws but we are still producing an increasing amount of the country's pollution contributions.  Whats bonded transport. Wouldnt transport be a cost too The rules of origin are far more complex as you make them out to be. Minimal value add does NOT qualify for re-origination.   https://www.nafta-sec-alena.org/Home/Legal-Texts/North-American-Free-Trade-Agreement?mvid=1&secid=feb541cc-bfc2-4240-829f-b5a7ec26a08a#A401 He never said that Mexico has equal standing to the US.  What he said was that the position of the US in the past was far more powerful than it's now. The US was a ""one of a kind"" economy, the by far biggest market and could thus negotiate trade deals in their favor. Now we've got China and Europe.  So if US renegotiates deals, then they'll be worse than they're now. And what Trump is doing right now weakens the US's position even further. If NAFTA gets terminated, then it would be a huge blow to both Trump and the US economy. It'll remove many trade partner the US had, because they used NAFTA through Mexico to trade with the US. However, the most important point is the ""fear"" companies will have towards Trump. He may fuck them over with his decisions that don't think about the consequences. It happened already with the ban for the people from several Muslim countries, now with a trade deal being terminated due to him it'll further increase the uncertainity. And business being uncertain is a bad thing, it'll have a big impact on the economy. So the US may get more damage due to the fall in reputation than it would get due to the failing of NAFTA.  Of course, Mexico won't get out of this without getting hurt, too. Europe and China will probably be happy to trade with them. It'll be worse, since distance is longer and since their economy is build around the US. American agriculture actually had a worse effect on Mexican agriculture than the other way around.   Perhaps we could paint NAFTA a different colour, and that would satisfy everyone? You're probably right, the few that understood were opposed but neoliberalism prevailed in the end. These are anything but free trade agreements. They're just investor rights protections. Trump pulling out of TPP seems like a win to me but I suspect for different reasons than his people see it.   What about American factory workers who lost their jobs when the factories went south? Seems like people on both sides of the border have reasons to be against NAFTA. Mexico's agriculture industry was notoriously garbage though. Much of the country isn't even arable, so that change is for the best long term right now agriculture is like the 9th or 10th top export Agriculture is a horrible backbone for an economy. Most countries want to move to higher paying industrial and service jobs.  Trade grows the pie, preventing universal healthcare, pushing to underfund education, pushing for reduce taxes, and pushing to defund social programs is how the rich fuck over everyone else.   Having a smaller pies does nothing for you if all those other things also keeps happening. And there are other costs too. Huge farms that treat farm animals like factory parts have reduced food costs, but are much more cruel than the small farms were. The food looks prettier while being less nutritious, since we can't tell the difference by looking at it. It's component in a long history beginning around the reagan years of privatization, deregulation, and free trade. Those people are even going against what Alan Greenspan and Paul krugman have said. Top oligarch economists know these policies butcher the average person; but the media will only focus on the 'positives', not the winners, not the losers. [removed] Ya absolutely we have got to take back our gov from the cronies before we do another tpp or nafta.  Lust Felt? It reduced the price for some items, but it also reduced the wages for about 70% of Americans. This is why it's so bad. Many economists even pointed this out. The reduction of the wages and benefits is far more harmful to most Americans than a reduction in prices.  I think that already happened on November 8th, 2016. Mexico has a history of failed governments and their current one is incredibly unpopular. Trump is also incredibly widely hated. If their government they hate even attempts to deal with Trump in a way that the people consider as caving to Trump any governmet officials involved are fucked. Mexico may come to the table but they will not give Trump a better deal than the current NAFTA. The people would actually overthrow them before that happened.  At least it's entertaining. Gotta grab the popcorn. which tweet is this? That is such an unfair statement. Lets not vote for the guy because hes a racist, fascist, etc, but then lets follow it up by using blanket statements to generalize an entire group of people!  The important thing is that you feel superior to somebody He also go to where he is by being born as the son of his father.  He was able to outsmart Hillary in getting the right votes despite losing the popular vote.  Everyone agreed his victory was in the face of insurmountable odds against him.  literally the only job the President is to try to get things done despite insurmountable odds and opposition.  I'm not sure why people think he can't beat Putin if he can beat Hillary who was one of the most savvy political operators of all time until her loss to Trump. If you are a white supremacist, it is the best mix. And ideally, you want your neighboring countries to be allies. You put your country in a really bad spot if you make enemies of your neighbors. People don't understand how far away *other* countries beyond Mexico and Canada are. Both of them are big countries, and the ones bordering Mexcio are too tiny to aid us even if Trump could humble himself enough to *ask*.  So far Trump hasn't tried to screw with Canada. But with them welcoming refugees and Muslims, denouncing Trump's policies and will surely disagree with most of Trump's trade proposals, I fear it's only a matter of time before Trump alienates them too. Now if only he could do it with Saudi Arabia... the difference is Obama and Sanders, when they talked about it, they talked about *updating* it, which doesn't imply a zero sum game. when you use rhetoric like that, it sounds like it could favor both sides. it doesn't mean one side has to lose. but when Trump talks about it, he talks about how Mexico has to give up this and give up that, and in order for the US to win, Mexico must lose.   so of course Mexico doesn't want to engage in that, and Trump has started to make the average American think NAFTA is horrible, and that we are being screwed by Mexico. Mexico meanwhile is starting to think Trump is trying to screw them and even from the NAFTA benefits they get now, they're wanting to say fuck you to Trump, which is their right.   Trump is going to realize, international affairs can't be negotiated the same way his leveraged bullying in puny hotel projects did.  In the end, if Mexico leaves NAFTA or the US/Mexico relationship is damaged badly, it will really hurt Mexico's economy *badly*, but it would also send the US into a recession - even if we're talking 60B vs 16B in exports. And Mexico might be willing to watch a short term crash to spite Trump. It could be better for them too. Mexico has the strongest position of anybody right now to do something to Trump. If NAFTA and Mexican trade is fucked, Trump will have a huge economic problem on his hands. ""Making America Great Again"" with rising unemployment rates, a dipping GNP and losing 16B in export volume is not really possible. He'd end up losing Midterm elections and then being impeached by a Dem Congress if the GOP tolerated him for that long.   So I say, Go Mexico! Push harder! Take one for the team! Take a short term major economic hit in order to avoid a new, badly negotiated NAFTA with a team of monkeys who only want to bully you! Perfect parallel. Up vote for the excellent analogy. Then just get a divorce  Idk why but I read this in john olivers voice. Perhaps Trump could reform NAFTA with only the US inside it? That might work out okay for him. Trump can't pull out of NAFTA anyways, it would take an act of congress. >""You have two ways to make the deal. You can make it your way, proving to the customer you are wonderful, wise, powerful, and right. Then the customer either buys once and never again, or he doesn't buy. Or you can invite the customer, hear his troubles, soothe his fears, show understanding, and he buys. Your way or his way. Your way, you feel superior all the way back to your clan's house with a begging bowl in your hand. His way, and he brings his children to buy from you next time.""  Tamora Pierce. *Cold Fire* In what business school do they teach that? Trump U, baby. The fightin' pussy grabbers. And economic disruption. And pissing off business interests who normally fund and support Republicans up and down the ticket.  And scream ""libtard"" at anyone who tries to tell them what's happening. Just like their rich masters taught them. Its the price of hyper-partisanship:    The other side is pro-business, we are pro-people.    But people can be helped by businesses succeeding.  That's trickle down economics, you're an idiot!  But I thought you like free trade and globalism too?  ... Because it helps immigrants?  No, you said it creates jobs and shares values.  ... But sharing values is cultural imperialism... So maybe i'm against free trade?  Free trade has also hurt unions, but lowered the costs of goods for the poorest americans.  Fuck im so confused... Ok maybe I'll just say that I'm pro trade, but whever there is a trade deal i'll say its a bad deal, but then when I am actually in office ill vote for it!  So... your plan is just to lie your face off?  Yeah!  Whoo, that kind of hurt my head there.  But doesn't that open up the door for someone else to just lie their face off but as long as he actually follows through on his promises he seems way more honest than you?  ...At least we are not talking about my emails. I can't call it's copyright and net neutrality effecting laws an improvement  That's false. TPP was focused on the Pacific sphere as a Geo-political play against China, NAFTA is totally different.  You can still download Bernie Sanders campaign document from his site calling TPP the worst trade agreement imaginable for US families. Emphasis on shit show So you're still pushing that Mr Magoo won the presidency huh?  I'm going to copy and paste someone else's response in the comments bellow, now I don't know if it's true, but if it is, kind of backs up what the poster stated.  > I work in international trade (in the U.S.), and NAFTA has a lot of loopholes. > For instance, many companies import goods (shirts, packaging, electronics, etc.) from Asian countries. They will then cut what is known as a T&E Bond (Transport and Export) which allows cargo to move within the U.S. without clearing Customs. > This cargo will get shipped to a factory in Mexico (duty free, as it's considered a temporary import to MX), and the factory in Mexico will stitch/print a logo or a minimal design. Then, the product is sent back into the U.S.... and STILL no duties/taxes are paid, because it is now a ""Mexican"" good. > Bullshit. They were manufactured in Asia. Companies do this ALL THE TIME. And our government is losing out on duties/taxes we SHOULD be collecting, due to NAFTA. > Figured this wouldn't be well known to a lot of people.   NAFTA benefited American Corporations. the American people got screwed. He says there were three effects:  A) Large Corp farmers moved shop overseas.  B) Farmers that stuck it out suckled on the government subsidy teat.  C) Everyone else lost the farm. Economies of scale. It drove the small craft producer out and replaced it with mass production farming at lower cost. Overall food costs went down, but large swaths of peasant mexican farmers were devastated by loss of their entire livelihood. Because it didn't do the same in the USA. Large-scale efficient farming in the USA dominates the industry in both countries now.  Well, Texas did vote red... That and if trump gets his way, Toyota will close the plant in San Antonio  I went to one of his rallies. My impression was the he was gonna end NAFTA one way or another and he needed the wall to keep the masses that will want to move north after mexicos economy crashes. Yeah the whole ""where is the value added"" is a really muddled area when it comes to the U.S. CFS (Code of Federal Regulations issued by CBP) - and that needs revisiting as well.     My understanding is Mexico has incredibly high duty/tax rates for Asian goods, as Mexico is still a heavy manufacturer and they compete with them.  Hence why the goods would hit the U.S. first.  Also, ocean freight rates Asia-U.S. West Coast are much cheaper than direct into Mexico. Our government does NOT make any money on bonded moves - a broker typically charges $85-$120 per bill of lading on a T&E Bond, no duty/tax is assessed, and it's shipped direct to Mexico at that point.  We (U.S. government) get no revenue on this type of move. I think the comparison is between ""import finished and packaged product, stamp logo on packaging"" vs ""import blank shirt, put design on shirt (and potentially package it)"", not putting a logo/design on a shirt vs other product. Whole-heartedly agree.  I've lived in LA since 2012.  Did you look around outside after the rain last week?  Unbelievable.  Our area is beautiful.  You could see all the mountains, with the snow on them.  The haze here is disgusting.  So many cars, trucks, all the ocean liners that come in to the ports... California needs a gigantic overhaul on pollution, for sure. So, in order to import or move any foreign cargo into the U.S., you have to purchase a ""bond"" - which is basically an insurance policy held by the importing party that's an agreement to U.S. Customs that the importing party holds responsibility of the cargo and will pay any duties/taxes etc., or dispose/return any goods rejected by Customs.     Transport is absolutely a cost; an average cost of trucking a full container from the LA port to Mexico is roughly in the $500-$700 range.   Duty/Taxes are typically in the 5-10% range.  If you're importing a container full of really anything, your value of those goods will typically exceed $30k - sometimes much, much higher i.e. electronics.  So even though transport is a cost, it is significantly cheaper to go China -> U.S. -> Mexico -> U.S. to avoid paying those duties, even with the extra transport, than it would to just ship a finished product directly (in some cases, not all.  It's not like every company does this sort of thing, or even makes sense to). You're correct in that rules of origin are more complex than I was stating - I'm not going to post a wall of text like that.     If you're curious, you would need to go to CBP's (Customs and Border Protection) website and look at the Code of Federal Regulations, which goes into much more detail.  Minimal value add in and of itself does not qualify; however, if that value add is what makes the product a unique commodity, it absolutely does e.g., branding/logos, a small specific part added to a base commodity for a unique function, etc.     Let me ask you this - if I import bags and handles as separate parts from China, and Mexico stitches them together, where are the goods made?  Currently, it'd be considered Mexico, which I think is why NAFTA needs a re-work. Just give it that extra oomph. You know, make it pop. Of course. However, as a result of every trade deal, you have a group of people who are shafted and suffer as a result. If there were a working democracy with working institutions, they would be given a safety net until they could transfer into other occupations or move on, but as it is currently, they don't get nearly enough help, they form a unified voice on the issue, and then the people who did benefit (from lowered prices for example) don't realise the benefit from the trade deal and rally against it. Hence why TLCAN, which is a very good thing overall for all participating countries, has so much hate.   Anyways, the guy originally mentioned agricultural industries so I was just clarifying that yes, Mexico's agricultural industries were downsized and ruined greatly under TLCAN.  The dissolution of NAFTA won't bring those jobs back though. In the auto industry right now automation is getting to the point where factories in China/India are getting automated. The places that literally have more people than anywhere else on earth  are still moving to automation because it's easier than paying humans. but low-skill manufacturing jobs aren't coming back to the US. At best the factories will be almost fully automated and require highly skilled/educated technicians to maintain the machinery and run the factory. You're right. But I think the whole country exchanged those manufacturing jobs for cheap cars, electronics and food.  Hopefully the US will realize they are better without those jobs and that they have to focus on creating value as swedes or Finns do But the factory jobs won't come back. Roboticisation. The agro economy meanwhile still uses labourers and will be slower to replace them. Mexico may well get a sympathy deal from the EU (lots of former carribean colonies have them) while the US could be in a trade war that reduces exports. Americans have more to lose from tearing up NAFTA and a lot of farmers will end up pissed. Exponentially more agriculture jobs went to America then factory jobs went south. America is a massive winner in nafta There are specific groups who lost out on both sides; but also a much vaster number of people who saw benefits from it. Unfortunately America has been really really bad about balancing that out. There were actually very, very few workers who lost their jobs *because* of NAFTA. Most people who lost their manufacturing jobs lost their jobs for the same reason that blacksmiths and artisans did - improvements in technology, namely automation. People lost their jobs because a robotic arm is way more efficient than a human being - consistent throughput, literal machine precision, never need time off or miss work, can work 24/7, never get sick, and can run on a couple of dollars worth of electricity per *day* compared to the ~$100+ that a worker would cost. Those manufacturing jobs are dead and aren't coming back. Automation is completely nullifying low-skill labor. Sure, you can bring ""manufacturing"" back into the States, but you CAN'T force businesses not to use cheaper, automated methods. It's like trying to ""bring back"" horseshoe making jobs by banning the use of cars... It's just a stupid solution. The American factory *owners* love their cheap labor and couldn't care less what American factory *workers* think.  That's because the people who write this kind of legislation and treaties are easy to buy with all the savings. They would have lost their jobs anyway and had to spend more for the stuff they have now.  If NAFTA didn't take out those jobs, automation would have and those people would be in even worse shape than they are now.  NAFTA was a net win for the economy and for the people in the United States, period. > What about American factory workers who lost their jobs when the factories went south?   These jobs are not coming back to the US, ever.  I don't mean like after Trump passes some cutting -edge resolution forcing companies to manufacture in their home state, I mean *ever.* It is simply so much cheaper to manufacture goods on a mass scale in Asia than it is in North America or Europe that there is nothing the US can do to entice the big companies to play ball. I'd bet big money that the person you're responding to was formerly in favor of all those thing because he was pretty sure they would only affect other people.  The thing about Trump supporters is that 10-15 years ago, these are the straight Republican ticket voters who wouldn't give a crippled crab a crutch. They'd talk about welfare queens and claim all the black people are on welfare. They just knew that their taxes were too high and the takers were gaming the system.  Fast forward a decade and now that they're out of work, because they never made any effort to stay competitive, we're all supposed to feel their pain and show them compassion and protect them from the reality of an interconnected global economy.  It's galling. You'll have to substantiate that claim with data. You're literally just taking correlations you don't like and attributing causation without pointing any causative agents. > but it also reduced the wages for about 70% of Americans  there you go with those alternative facts again. Maybe you should look beyond blaming a free trading agreement for your problems and face the fact that it's the governments refusal to redistribute wealth within the country that has caused wage stagnation.  But trickle down is going to work right?  Better lower taxes for the super rich just to make sure, don't worry, what's left of the middle class can pay for it.    >It reduced the price for some items, but it also reduced the wages for about 70% of Americans  Except...that [that's completely wrong](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEHOINUSA672N). In the short term NAFTA actually caused wages to *increase*. In the longer term, wages evened out and are now practically flat after we take into account the recession of 2008-2009 and the subsequent recovery, wages are *still* substantially higher than they were in 1994 when NAFTA was first passed. Partner this with lower goods prices due to...well, cheaper goods, and the average person actually has *more* purchasing power. I sure hope so. It's long over due.  https://imgur.com/NLCw3Fh Ding ding ding He got where he was by being born. Calling people a white supremacist with no justification is the same as liberals calling everyone racist all the time for no good reason. This is exactly why Trump was elected so I encourage you to keep it up.  And when that happens, please remember that it is Trump and his supporters we have a beef with, not America. We love Americans. But we're pretty sure we don't like Trump. You've already got enemies in Saudi Arabia, hence 9/11. > And Mexico might be willing to watch a short term crash to spite Trump  No they're not.   It's sad but at the end of the day the US is a major trading partner, most people aren't willing to kamikaze against its greater economy for some marginal gain. So Trump will generally get away with *some* bullying...if he doesn't go crazy and unite people (he hasn't yet) I wonder what are the chances that they get closer to China if we piss them off too. Wow, so you want Mexico to take a ""short term major economic hit"" (ie go into a serious recession or even depression) just to spite Trump?  Do you even know how ridiculous that sounds? The cost of such an act would be massive (YUGE) and would probably be seen as one of the dumbest moves in the history of Mexico.  > Trump has started to make the average American think NAFTA is horrible, and that we are being screwed by Mexico.  hell i remember my stepdad thinking that back in the 90's.  Yeah, Mexico! Go into crippling poverty to stick it to Donald Trump!  That seems like a reasonable suggestion. > but when Trump talks about it, he talks about how Mexico has to give up this and give up that, and in order for the US to win, Mexico must lose.  This has already been said many times, but for someone that calls himself a great businessman, Trump actually seems to understand very little about business.  In his simple mind, every deal is a zero sum game, there must be a loser and a winner. But that's not how business works. A good deal is a deal that benefits both parties. It's quite alarming that he doesn't understand the basics. Except it's economics and not a marriage.... There are definitely way too many costs to renegotiating NAFTA, but maybe the conditions are right for it to change without it causing too much damage. They renegotiate in the WTO every few rounds, it's not like they're gonna stop all business until the thing is done.  If he takes over the rest of North America I can see that happening. A trade deal for only one country.... >  Tamora Pierce  Ah middle school memories. Omg...i want to make jerseys for this school...this would be AMAZING Free trade, international relations in general really, is prohibitively complex. What I mean by that is that the average person, even if they're quite clever indeed, doesn't understand them because they lack the specialised knowledge, education, and experience you need to properly figure it out.  Hence, the need for experts! TPP forced US copyright laws onto your trade partners. It was didn't change anything for American except reffer to the laws you have on the books for reference. For a lot of Americans they didn't know they had these laws on the books so for them is seemed TPP was legislating them in (not legislation) instead of enforcing your laws on your trade partners. It was very pro-American corporate interests but it was your partners who suffered that, for Americans the change would have been a bigger shared marketplace and closer relations with several neighbors and trade partners of China. Maybe make changing those laws you have harder as your trade partners would be angry that you forced them but then changed it for yourself. TPP didn't forced net neutrality rules in any other way, and the copyright provisions are already the law in most of parties to the treaty. People would know this if they bothered reading the actual text of the treaty.  TPP included both Canada and Mexico. All provisions included in TPP that did not exist in NAFTA (labour conditions, environmental protections, etc.) would've applied to North American trade.  Since both Canada and Mexico were in the TPP it was functionally a NAFTA replacement.  There was a Wall Street Journal expose on a Chinese billionaire whose aluminum company was hit with anti-dumping tariffs.  So he created a Mexican shell company, and created stamped aluminum shipping pallets with his excess Chinese aluminum, shipped it to Mexico.    The Mexican company would then take orders and ship the aluminum into the US, avoiding dumping tariffs.  At one point, it was the largest stockpile of aluminum in the world.    Curiously, the entire stockpile was shipped to Vietnam.  [Links here](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=wall+street+journal+chinese+aluminum+stockpile) It really makes a person wonder why a post like this is even necessary. Weird since our biggest imports to Mexico are agricultural, where we have more than a surplus (Mexican farmers can't compete with American ones). Heck, even china imports a lot of agriculture products from America, which doesn't happen much vice versa.   This just isn't backed up on evidence, manufacturing maybe, but farmers do very well on Nafta and will be the first ones to make sure isn't repealed.  How do large corp farmers move shop oversea?  Aren't their farms in the US?  You can't move land.  I would argue that it was bad for a small segment of the population, but good for the broader population. This is borne out by the major improvements in quality of living for Mexicans over the past several decades Its not the source of what goes into our supermarkets because the agricultural industry is able to provide cheaper prices. They cannot increase the prices because mexican products would be able to undercut them.  However, with NAFTA gone, the agricultural industry will have no incentive to keep prices where they are. So it might not be bare, but it will become more expensive. Yes, and I'm willing to bet the large majority of Texan voters don't understand NAFTA at all. All they know is it has something to do with Mexico, which is enough for a lot of them. yeah, but they voted Cruz in the primaries By the smallest margin that I can ever remember.  The tides are changing in Texas. Which means a loss of manufacturing jobs. Jobs he promised to bring back to the U.S.  When the fuck are those voters going to wake up and realize they screwed up?  But I don't think his plan involved no trade with Mexico - that would also fuck the US. Okay, but, what are you stamping?  Plastic?  Aluminum billets (nod to posts above here)?  Stickers?  Shirts?  It's still a big ass machine, with at least one dude watching that and one dude watching the box-o-tron 5000 that all of your ""products""/shirts are falling into.  I don't necessarily disagree with the idea as a whole, but the idea that shirts are somehow more value added than plastic or metal is ridiculous, unless somebody tells me that shirts are a lot harder to do.    I knew a girl who worked for a company that did shirt prints waaaaaaaaaay back in highschool, and she sat in the front and did reception stuff while -maybe- one dude watched stuff in the back.  Usually he just started it and bailed, because he was the owner's kid.  If you're going to hate on workers doing work, at least be consistent.  Shirts aren't special.  *edit- Box-o-tron 5000 is probably wishful thinking.  A lot of unboxing/reboxing is done by hand.* I've been in socal since the 80s.  They've SAID air quality has gotten better but there are a lot more cars and the polluted, smoggy haze never really went away.  So once Trump's enacts laws to mess with companies like apple who manufacture in China. They could just ship it to Mexico to apply a screen protector and packaging to avoid import duties Paint it red. Make it go faster. > The places that literally have more people than anywhere else on earth are still moving to automation because it's easier than paying humans.  Runs 24/7, no breaks, no accidents, no health insurance, doesn't get sick, can do unpleasant or dangerous labour, consistent and so on; there is a lot of good to be said looking at it from the many advantages. ""Good news! We're bringing the plant back to your town. Bad news is that we'll only be hiring 3 people to maintain the robots."" ^ Seriously this, so much. People just don't seem to understand that those manufacturing jobs are DEAD. They AREN'T COMING BACK. China is beginning to automate their production DESPITE their abysmally low labor costs. Anytime anyone brings up this ""bring back manufacturing jobs"" BS, the point you made desperately needs to be said and REPEATED, over and fucking over again.  I find most of the people who talk about automation have never worked in a plant with robots. All our machine operators had just HS diplomas, and I was programming those robots while going to college at the same time.  So even if those plants came back to the US and were heavily automated, they'd still employ US citizens, and those companies would be spending money and paying taxes within the US.  Most of you just want an excuse to continue exploiting third world labor at terrible wages and working conditions, all so you can keep getting cheap crap. You are disgusting. There is no such thing as fully automated. These factories just don't run on monitors. Even the most advanced still provide a lot of jobs. In fact manufacturing has increased worldwide every year and this is projected to continue.  Agriculture has also experienced a lot of automation as well. Now most jobs are planting and limited numbers when harvesting. Part Time seasonal work.  I'll make a point that there is the effect on workers and an effect on communities.  If you look at a factory undergoing technological improvements, you will find that the trade off is  low skilled jobs decline, but higher skilled jobs increase. The skilled jobs don't offset the low skilled job losses. True enough.  However outsourcing is terrible indeed because all the jobs disappear as well as a lot of indirect jobs go away. And the tax revenue goes away. All at once. That's devastating to communities effected.  this just begs the questions...  why are low-skill manufacturing jobs available in Mexico and not the US? why is it that when the factories come back, it will be ""fully automated"" but not like that in Mexico?   sure the wages will be higher but how much higher is it relative to the cost of living for an American in the US? and could such costs be mitigated by say... Trump backed government incentives and subsidies? will all factories be able to afford full automation?  And to be progressive on this, the upward momentum generated by the renewed American economy will help motivate and augment society into one that doesn't have a surplus of low skill workers. in short, it's not meant to be like this forever. you need step A to get to step B, and step A is to bring the jobs back and get the shitheads working so their kids can be those **technicians**, i.e. step B That would require improving educational outcomes and reducing illegal immigration / H1B abuses, however.  That is easy to say when the loss of those jobs didn't affect you. Mxico already has a fta with the EU... And most other economies that matter.  > Roboticisation  Automation? But the agriculture jobs are very low paying and employ migrant workers. So to the Trump demographic that's not an economic win. And to the country getting lots of very low paying jobs that are immediately filled with people outside the previous employment pool is not a great tradeoff, particularly when the result is increased profit in the agricultural sector rather than reduced prices.  The whole selling point of outsourcing was that we would save so much on staple goods and textiles that it would make up the losses for blue collar jobs. That hasn't really panned out, and the manufacturing losses have been more severe and more permanent than estimated. How do you calculate ""winners"" or ""losers""? Raw job creation? GDP added? Manufacturing isn't low skill, can you program and run a CNC? And the US is still the #2 manufacturing nation. Median income isn't real wages per a person. Here's another graph: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwqM86DGqvAFTmpxdXB4U2tVRUE/view?usp=sharing  See that 75-85% Number? that's the middle class right there. Over a 20 year period there real wage increase was just barely increased, stagnated and at worse was negative, combine that with inflation and rising rental prices and we don't yet have disaster, but we have severe pain for this section of the country.   Also median income stats are tricky as they can look at at an aggregate household's income and extrapolate that to everyone in the household. That is if a mom and and dad are making 60k each, and there's 3 millennials looking for jobs, all 5 people will be considering making 60k each, thus bumping up the median income for entire household. thanks You might want to sharpen tour reading skills. It is a fact rhat Bannon/Trump has many white supremacist endorsements. They love Bannon. I said nothing more.   Btw, I dont judge statements based on whether they get someone elected, I judge them based on whether they are true. The government/royalty are allies though, hence wishing they were enemies instead.  I'm a Brit not an American but they're our allies as well regrettably. The fact that Saudis perpetrated 9/11 doesn't mean they're enemies. Things are a little bit more complicated than that.  Saudis are still America's strongest allies in the middle east. ""Millions for defense, not a penny for tribute"" - Spoken by Early Americans  Don't underestimate how much national pride would be lost if Mexico essentially submitted to extortion. a short term crash would be better financially than long-term poor terms they would be locked into until the end of time. they're better off trying to knock Trump off and getting an Administration that wants to be a partner with Mexico, not a bully. and Trump isn't getting away with any. Mexico is already standing up to them and saying fuck you. Obviously, YOU don't know the Mexicans!  The majority of Mexicans are well known for causing sabotage within their own selves.  So now... what makes you think an orange colored American is going to be the exception?  You better strap on amigo because we're going for the ride of our life!...  >  most people aren't willing to kamikaze against its greater economy for some marginal gain.  For that I have one word ""Brexit""   Yes, they are. That's democracy for you. Mexico would lose in any trade war, and they know it. The damage will not be short term, but in the long term relationship. Mexico will stop considering America a friend but a competitor, they will reorient towards China and S America.    A good parallel is Vietnam. It was tired of being bullied by China, so turned towards America (ironic). 20 years after their shift they generally support the US on issues relating to the S China Sea and other disputes. That is what we may end up with Mexico. WOW, your reading comprehension skills are not very good! i think Mexico should take a short term hit to save their asses long term. if they take what Trump tries to force on them it will be far worse long term.   again, facing short term economic pain for long term survival. getting locked into a shittier version of NAFTA and being forced to pay for the wall would be much, much worse long term. so true. zero sum is the way he looks at the world, not just business. it's a terribly dangerous outlook. With Bannon at the helm, it's guaranteed that any terms presented will be unreasonable.  Except it's politics too and not just economics, and Trump is pissing off all of our trading partners. So what happens when Mexico realizes that they have a lot of other options, and we may not if Trump keeps alienating everyone? You might want to have higher standards if you're willing to marry from a pool of billions of people Now you have 33 million angry, well educated and armed second class citizens within your borders who look just like you, talk just like you, and have some of the most vast wilderness in the world to hide out in. Not to mention they'll almost certainly have backing from China and the EU. That without the nightmare of invading one of the most rebelious countries in the world, where armed gangs control vast swaths of influence and people just disappear.  Good night America.   I'd take Mexico. I don't want Canada.  Cheaper wall, too. Me too! Cats everywhere beware! Bah.  Its mildly complex.  And I don't begrudge experts.  I begrudge lying politicians who use the complexity of these things to lie to the public about them in the most transparent manner to anyone even mildly intelligent and versed in the topic.  Yet Trump is the one called out for this and Hillary gets a free pass in the media on it.   Was the full text of the TTP and TTiP released to the public? >Curiously, the entire stockpile was shipped to Vietnam.  Sounds like they were prepping for TPP. Oops.  During the campaign, Trump was accused of getting steel for his buildings the same way. I don't remember if it was an established fact. Truthfully? People don't want to understand internet bits in depth, so they do a quick scan and that's it. Almost everything online is previous bias without a ton of critical analysis or understanding. Nearly all of our exports are [corn or other government subsidized products](https://www.export.gov/article?id=Mexico-Agriculture). They need to be subsidized, or else we couldn't compete with the [products coming out of Mexico](http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Americas/Mexico-AGRICULTURE.html). Subsidized products have become the lifeblood of the industry. http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2013/09/does-corporate-farming-exist-barely  https://www.farmaid.org/issues/corporate-power/corporate-power-in-ag/  Chinese corps buy out American Corps, none of them touch a farm. Instead they hire smaller farmers to farm for them. They then [force these farmers to stay in contract with them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=safw2MvdaU4). Yes after millions moved north, and their extended families got part of their money from western union, they were able to do something the mexican government ever thought of doing, helping people who lost to nafta. Correct.  Well, that's democracy. An ignorant voter has the same weight as an informed one. Never.  In their minds they stuck it to liberals and that's a win for them.  The entire country could go to shit, but they will never believe they screwed up. He's not saying stamping shirts is hard. He's say the company is doing the least amount of work (or value add) to the item to change it's 'origin' - in the sense it's now a Mexican product instead of being from Asia. I've seen Automotive companies do similar with steel mostly.  You are focusing way too much on the shirts dude.  Let's switch up the analogy.  China makes silk.  China sends silk to woman in San Francisco.  Woman uses silk to make a dress.  The dress was made in San Francisco, while the materials are from China.  But the end product can say ""Made in San Francisco.""  Now let's say company in China makes silk dresses.  Company in China ships the silk dresses to woman in San Francisco.  Woman then adds a sticker to the side of the dress saying ""Made in San Francisco""  With the intent of the sticker being removed, because it isn't part of the product just a label.  In this scenario the product wasn't actually made in San Francisco.  Now how does this apply to NAFTA?  US tells Mexico ""Hey if you start manufacturing in industry X we won't tax whatever you sell to us.""  They do this to bolster Mexico's economy so that the US has a more economically stable neighbor.  But the factory for X is never made.  No new jobs are created.  Someone from China ships in product X to Mexico and slaps a sticker on it that says ""Hecho en Mexico.""  Now the guy in China is making a lot of money, while both the US workers and Mexico workers lose out because they both lost their jobs to China. It's really a bummer, because it's a really gorgeous area.... when the air is clear.     I don't think I'll be living here permanently unless they fix the smog / housing market gets cheaper. This would highly depend on those laws and their verbage, as well as if NAFTA is still in place.  The only benefit of this interaction right now is that under NAFTA you can dodge duty/tax with the Mexico interaction.     For something like electronics Mexico would need to do more than apply a screen protector - most likely they would ship over all the phone parts and assemble them in Mexico to try and qualify.  But if Trump enacts laws to mess with companies using Chinese manufacturers, AND gets rid of NAFTA, then no one really knows how that would play out. WAAAAAGGHHHH!!!!! It's sad that we live in a world so backwards that automation is seen as a negative. Employing robots should be a big win for the common man, it makes work easier and safer.   It would also reduce how many of us need to work or for how long, but unfortunately we justify our right to food and water based on the amount of menial work we accomplished today.  Hey if corporations are people why can't robots get rights too! :) disadvantage: What do you now do with all the workers who previously head well paying union jobs?  don't tell me UBI, because if that ever gets implemented, its not likely to pay more than min wage. no pensions There was an article in r/futurology a couple of days ago about this exact thing happening in the US and Canada. Maybe not assembly line jobs but the white collar jobs that are associated with factories. The supply line that factories require. The points of entry whether ports or airports. The people that are gonna be there to fix, install, design the robots. Add all of them up and its a significant amount of high paying jobs.  By nature and design, it takes far fewer high school graduates to keep the robots running than it takes to have high school graduates do the jobs. That's the point.  They all talk like increases in productivity are something new. Productivity has been increasing since manufacturing started, and in the past has lead to increased wages. Only recently have productivity increases and wage increases been decoupled, as corporations want to do exactly what you say:'continue exploiting third world labor at terrible wages and working conditions'.  > Most of you just want an excuse to continue exploiting third world labor at terrible wages and working conditions, all so you can keep getting cheap crap. You are disgusting.  That's a stretch but at least it allows you to feel self-righteous!  This broken window fallacy thinking. I thought republicans were supposed to be fiscally conservative. If things cost more because they are built in the country, it doesn't mean suddenly more people are employed. It means more people are employed in manufacturing, but fewer jobs in the areas that the difference in money would be supporting.   If I have 150 dollars and spent 100 dollars on cars and 50 dollars on booze before. Now jobs are more expensive, so cars are more expensive. Now I spend 140 dollars on cars and 10 dollars on booze. John Booze seller is now poorer, I have less booze, and the same amount of car.   Sure, people that work at the plant now have work, but John has less.  This is why conservatives generally favor free trade (until they decided they cared less about their ideals and more about winning in the last 6 months).   The argument about working conditions is different and an interesting point. However, the difference between no jobs and some jobs in many of these countries is something, as money is flowing into these countries.   China has pulled something like 200 million people out of destitution and into the semblance of a lower to middle class. This isn't something that should disgust you.  There will still be jobs in manufacturing. They will be higher-skilled, and fewer of them. As soon as [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7Os5Okf3OQ) are ready for work employment in the agricultural sector will take the next big hit. Automation doesn't stop where it's now and the main problem is the skill needed to handle this technology. It might create some jobs but those aren't jobs for the welder or car mechanic who lost his job some years ago.  > There is no such thing as fully automated.  Of course which is why I had the word ""almost"" right before the word ""fully"". I would agree but this is exactly why strong unions and actual regulations that benefit the middle/working class really matter. Our country has spent the last 40 years demonizing unions and regulations. I'm on board for the most part but I also think that to accomplish this we need strong unions and public education that isn't the laughing stock of the developed world. Hoping that one president will change everything for the better is only beneficial in the short-term we need to shift our perceptions to a mentality where the question we ask is ""What's best for us in the long-term?"" rather than ""What's best for me in the short-term?"".  Improving education yeah but considering most illegal immigrants are unskilled labourers and you just agreed those jobs aren't coming back idk what they have to do with anything. It's almost as if investing in education before this became a problem would've made sense.  These job losses have effected me and the area I used to live greatly. Here is what responsible people do: take advantage of the wealth of the US education system, re-learn a skill, and MOVE.  You don't demand the world regress because a high paying job isn't at your doorstep. That is the world telling you your doorstep isn't a useful place anymore.  Protectionism is welfare for the irrelevant and selfish, and it makes the world a poorer place. > That is easy to say when the loss of those jobs didn't affect you.  Sorry, but the United States has a dynamic economy and freedom of labor movement. I never understood this arrogance that one should be guaranteed employment in a specific sector in a specific town. You know hundreds of thousands of people lost jobs when the price of oil tanked. Should the US government save them?  Why do those that work in manufacturing think it is their god, given right to work in a factory their entire life in their podunk town of 500? Ironically (not even sure it is correct to use this, but whatever) the more devastated these regions become the more attractive they are for investment. More tech companies are moving to Ohio and Michigan for instance. We should be talking about job retraining for the middle aged and young, and Universal Basic Income for those that are at the age where it is difficult and understandable not being able to change careers or move. Protecting manufacturing is just a bandaid solution and kicking the can further out.  You don't seem to understand that the US consumerism benefited enormously because of NAFTA, I can even bet the car you are driving you were able to Afford because of it, along with your tv, etc.  The loss/win isn't comparable. There are even studies in which the correlation between unemployment because of globalization or trade is on a 2.5 ratio, which is insignificant and doesn't apply, on a macroeconomic level the globalization and nafta is doing WAY more for your country than a thousand jobs losts, educate yourself and look for constant improvement on yourself as well    And if it did affect him someone else would call him bias. An FTA or a trade deal? Got a source? WE FIND AUTOMATON OFFENSIVE. >And to the country getting lots of very low paying jobs that are immediately filled with people outside the previous employment pool is not a great tradeoff, particularly when the result is increased profit in the agricultural sector rather than reduced prices.  Prices did drop. The % you spend on food or other material staples has dropped a lot in the past 3 decades. Right now protectionism would push the marginalized people you and I are talking about deeper into poverty with no gaurentee many jobs will re-appear.  >The whole selling point of outsourcing was that we would save so much on staple goods and textiles that it would make up the losses for blue collar jobs.   For the vast majority of Americans these benefits occurred. To very specific people in specific areas the downside was also tangible.  >That hasn't really panned out, and the manufacturing losses have been more severe and more permanent than estimated.  Part of that is automation. Those jobs were already on the way out but instead of machines it went south and machines.   In a way it mirrors the drastic reduction of labor required for industrial farming and how that made small town america economically unsustainable. There is nothing to do to stem the tide, it's a tide technology enabled and you can't go back. The fondly remembered era of well paid American manufactruing jobs happened for a lot of reasons that can't be repeated (the rest of the industrial powers were smoking ruins, demand for things was there but the ability to make them was mostly in america). Robotics , the rebuilding of the world, and the industrialization of the poorer nations means those nostalgic memories are just that.  Trumps policies goals would shrink the over all pie to claw back thousands of jobs and potentially cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs in other areas. The clawed back jobs will be low paying, they will take a while, the cost to do it will be carried by the end customers and they will ebb as robotics advances.  lose-lose-lose to remedy nothing more than feeling of insecurity in his support base. It's a win for all the countries involved overall. Sectors of all countries involved suffered however.   In a one party or authoritarian state, this can be easily remedied and taken care of efficiently by moving resources around to accommodate for those that suffered, while still reaping benefits. In a working democracy, some of the money gained would be put back into the safety net in order to help out the part of your country that did suffer.   The problem is that both the US and Mexico are democratic nations that are unfortunately plagued with government stagnation and as a result, both economies did benefit and the vast majority of citizens of both countries benefited, but a small portion of both countries did not, and did not receive any assistance afterwards either. They come together and protest the deal that caused this, create a unified and loud voice, and because the majority of citizens who did benefit don't see direct benefit (lowered prices and the ability to get goods from all across the world, food products, exotic items, etc. is something only possible with globalisation and trade deals; a few centuries ago, only the wealthiest would have been able to afford regular supplies of exotic peppers, etc. You had wars being fought over salt, over pepper, over other spices like nutmeg (see the Dutch Empire and the VOC)), so they think that naturally, the deal is bad and was not beneficial for them.   As a result, the trade deal, which is mutually beneficial, is now poisoned and is now being attacked. Something similar is happening to the EU; we receive so many benefits from the EU but politicians love to blame their ills on the EU. Though that's a complex topic for another day.   But regarding raw job creation, all countries involved gained jobs as a result of the increased trade they did, all countries also improved their GDP as a result of the trade deal.   Nope, but I bet you I could learn within a week easily. Guess what can learn even faster, work longer hours, and be paid less? A robot.  And you COMPLETELY missed my point. It's not whether or not the US is a manufacturing powerhouse. It's whether or not manufacturing jobs lost in the rust belt are AVAILABLE TO HUMANS. >Median income isn't real wages per a person.  Actually, that's exactly what it is. You are thinking of *mean* wages. Mean and median are two completely different things.  >Here's another graph:   A graph of *global* distribution graph.  >See that 75-85% Number? that's the middle class right there. Over a 20 year period there real wage increase was just barely increased, stagnated and at worse was negative, combine that with inflation and rising rental prices and we don't yet have disaster, but we have severe pain for this section of the country.  That graph doesn't tell you much of anything. In large part because the data set is so ridiculous heterogenous that it's of very little use except for ridiculously broad spectrum views. So you'll either need to susbtantiate that with much more specific data sets or focus on region-specific data.  You are using that graph to conclude that the middle class has been hurt even though it doesn't say that. It's the equivalent of me saying that most people went from making $0.50 an hour to making $2.00 an hour but because I went from making $18 to $18.10 I've lot out! It's a ridiculous and very tenuous argument.  Furthermore, it's so utterly devoid of useful context. Consumer prices have a huge effect on quality of life. You could have a decrease in wages partnered with a decrease in prices, and so long as the decrease in prices outpaces the decrease in wages you've actually had a net *gain*.  Yet another problem is that you are, for some reason, assuming static demographics with that graph. And...yeah, that's bad for obvious reasons, because demographic makeups change and the people who were the 75% to 85% 30 years ago are not the same people who they are today. For example, the Chinese have moved into the 75% to 85% bracket, bringing down the number considerably. This is why using global data to talk about regional issues as if it existed in a vacuum is a bad, bad idea.  Furthermore, you're implying a problem that may not be a problem. So can we please just [shoot the elephant](http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21707219-charting-globalisations-discontents-shooting-elephant) and stop pretending that highly contextual data without the adequate context is just useless?  >Also median income stats are tricky as they can look at at an aggregate household's income and extrapolate that to everyone in the household.   Which actually just makes the numbers better, because average household size has been decreasing. Most people's journeys require effort. Who is these white supremacists? The left love to throw out this word but very few people subscribe to the idea that white people are better than everyone and should dominate other groups. Even someone like david duke who is much maligned by the left is not a white supremacist. He believes white people have a right to exist in homogeneous countries just as every other race does. That is actually an egalitarian world view, not a supremacist one.  Enough princes had ""accidents"" following 9/11 that there is no way royals weren't involved. Mate, they're not allies, they just buy our guns in exchange for oil.  I figured Israel was our greatest ally in the ME, considering they are a democracy and Saudis are not. No, only Americans are allowed to have national pride, Mexicans and Chinese and Iranians will cower and bend over to our greatness and the greatness of our orange headed president pussy cat grabber.  /s  Of course, they aren't going to capitulate, what politician in their right mind could? They will nuke the agreeement before they agree to shit like that.  Don't underestimate how quickly Mexican unemployment would reach 50% if they decided to kill 80% of their exports economy. Just as something to weigh in your thinking, politics often favors short term thinking. If the Mexican people are afraid of the effects of a recession RIGHT NOW, they are less likely to vote for someone who is proposing long term solutions. I'm not saying that's the case in Mexico right now, frankly I don't know much about it, but I just wanted to offer that as something to be aware of.  Hmm, but what if it were Mexico, and Canada, and China, and the EU?  What if they all embargoed the US?  Certainly Trump is dumb enough to antagonise all of them at the same time - and if they cut the US off from imports, exports and finance, it wouldn't be pretty.   Economics (and politics) doesn't work that way. There's no guarantee how bad the ""short term hit"" will be, or how long the recovery (if it ever comes) will be, or the political fallout. It could get as crazy as some regions of Mexico becoming de-facto narco states if the government gets into serious economic crisis.  In any event, the President will not want to be the one who fucks the whole country up on the basis of just embarrassing Trump. As for long-term consequences, he most likely won't be around to see them anyway once his term ends.  If Mexico gets shut out of NAFTA it won't be their own choosing.  Canada and America have been talking about a NAFTA without Mexico.  Mexico will have to beg to stay in with a weaker agreement.  Because both Canada and US maintain a trade deficit with Mexico neither country will see themselves as worse off without them.  The only thing even keeping Mexico at the table right now is that they were original members. For Mexico it's cheaper to sell to the US than anyone else... As a Texan, this thought is terrifying.  I don't get it and I want to get it!  I'd actually love to see that.  Get all the Canadians pissed off enough to start a civil war and we can compare armed forces. How big is the Canadian Air Force? Mexico has more than 33 million people.  It has more than 100 million people. Hillary isn't the POTUS now, is she? Mildly complex in the same way building a nuclear bomb is mildly complex. Simple in theory, but you can't go out and do it yourself now can you? If you think you can, then I'm sorry, you're a total fool and need to educate yourself.   Also, Hillary isn't the president. Trump is. Hillary doesn't matter anymore. Your boy is in the spotlight now. His own incompetence, stupidity, greed, and utter lack of anything remotely like morals are what matter. TPP's full text has been available since November 2015. TTIP's still, officially, under negotiation, so no final draft is available.  Full text of TPP was released in January 2016 That simply isnt true. US agriculture is quite efficient, and massive, compared to Mexico. We are about as efficient to farming as one can be, even with subsidies. American farmers are going to be hurt badly if NAFTA falls apart.  That answers not at all how large corp farmers move shop oversea.  Perhaps you should explain what you mean by moving shop oversea.  Essentially this, this is also a good example.  And since the ""value add"" (in this case, a minimal effort sticker/stamp whatever) is in Mexico, it becomes a NAFTA good and the U.S. importer pays 0 duty/tax on it - which is a huge issue.     Also, since this is occurring outside the U.S., it's incredibly difficult to regulate.  Hence why I think this loophole should be closed. The two are related. I've lived around here basically my entire life. We've always had localized pollution issues but now the SD/OC/LA area has 20-30M people despite stricter regulation it seems like we are still polluting more than we're conserving. Definitely on air quality.   It takes a particularly windy or rainy day to really push the smog haze away. It is only occasionally clear.  > It's sad that we live in a world so backwards that automation is seen as a negative. Employing robots should be a big win for the common man, it makes work easier and safer.   I'm from Ireland and we greatly benefited from heavy investment in education and building a 'knowledge economy'. We used to rely heavily on agriculture and were pretty much a backwater when we achieved independence from the UK. Also the poorest country in the EU when we joined. Now there is a massive, well relative to the size of the country, scientific presence in Ireland which is a major part of our exports.  There is no way Ireland would be doing well if we had failed to adapt to a changing world/economy. Trying to remain stagnant in a changing world just means that some other country/company/person adapts and outshines you.  > It's sad that we live in a world so backwards that automation is seen as a negative. Employing robots should be a big win for the common man, it makes work easier and safer.   Well unfortunately the main reason this *isn't* seen as a positive (particularly in the US) is due to the uncaring nature of unchecked capitalism practiced therein. Wages stagnating while profits go up, breaking unions resulting in no worker representation, all of these things coupled with poor education results in an unhappy populace and it's especially prevalent in the US. Yep. This problem will become increasingly evident as automation becomes more commonplace. Either the world will become more dystopian as fewer and fewer people are able to find more jobs to support themselves and their families, or it can become more utopian as fewer people *need* to work. There are issues that we would need to overcome, like figuring out how to incentivize people to do what jobs *are* still necessary when they don't need to have a job to survive, but it's something that needs to be addressed at some point in the not too distant future. The problem is that the expensive up front costs of automation is a barrier to smaller companies and individuals, so that means the rich will be in control of all the means of production with little to no reliance on workers. That obviously won't be sustainable, so some kind of near post scarcity equalization will have to happen. The question is how will it happen. That's okay as long as they follow three simple rules. > Hey if corporations are people why can't robots get rights too! :)  Because I want my toaster to toast bread in the morning and not give me any backtalk!  Edit: Unless I specifically ask for that model of toaster of course :P > disadvantage: What do you now do with all the workers who previously head well paying union jobs?  That's not a disadvantage from the companies' viewpoints.  >don't tell me UBI, because if that ever gets implemented, its not likely to pay more than min wage.  Just an aside but the minimum wage varies throughout the world. I don't disagree with that. The question I have, and that I think is relevant, is are more jobs gained or lost OVERALL as a result of automation? I seriously think more are lost. A single high-skilled worker can build and maintain, generally, SEVERAL machines. A single Machine, generally, replaces SEVERAL humans on its own. So, yes, new jobs are created, but an exponential number more jobs are lost. I'm talking about ""Rust Belt"" workers here. Low-skill labor. THEIR jobs are dead and not coming back. None of this happens without trade agreements and ditching the TPP and, most likely, torpedoing NAFTA are not going to get us there. But it's still a net plus in jobs being done in the US at a good wage compared to exploiting labor in the third world under horrible conditions. The people arguing we shouldn't change anything and continue the current practices are either useful idiots for the top 1%, or they don't care how their stuff gets made so long as it's cheap. I'm not a Republican, just a lifelong Democrat that is sick of them abandoning the working class. Your argument is faulty and is the same one used to oppose raising the minim wage. Bringing those manufacturing jobs back to the US would mean prices would be higher on those goods, but the workers would earn more than they are doing service jobs right now. So it's a trade of having cheap goods combined with fewer jobs at lower pay, for slightly higher priced goods combined with more jobs at higher pay.  China can worry about their own citizens, we need to worry about our own for once. I'm all for fair trade between nations. So if China wants to improve their record on human rights, workers rights, and environmental regulations, then I'd have no problem with free trade with them once they meet some benchmarks in those areas. Instead what we've gotten for several decades was a race to the bottom by opening up trade without making them reform first. True. There are also jobs that these will bring in. R and D for instance tends to be concentrated in areas where manufacturing takes place. Maintenance and purchasing of equipment and expansions benefits the local economies etc.  that's the thing, there's no implication of short-term thinking in what i have to say. This is the path that we should be heading, it ensures that people who are unemployed are no longer sitting on their hands being bitter about society. It helps them find value in their lives that they will pass on to the next generation, who stands to continue their forefather's bitter attitude about society **if** nothing is done about the loss of jobs in the low-skill market now.   it seems, at some point in the past, society has moved on from Industrialization, but has left these stragglers behind, what we need to do is go back and pick them up and help them move forward, not leave them behind forever.  Aren't most illegal immigrants skilled tho? The fraction of border crossing mexicans is pretty small compared to those who overstayed their visas.  > take advantage of the wealth of the US education system, re-learn a skill, and MOVE.  Oh, yes, it's just *so easy* guys.  Why didn't anyone think of this before veryearlyonemorning did?  Maybe because doing into debt to learn a new skill is not on most people's list of things to do when they have a home, family and social network established where they are.  It's not anything close to as simple as you make it out to be. I agree. Imagine using those machines or skilled workers to create specialized parts for the Aerospace industry, or biotech, etc. i like biking and some of the best bike parts are manufactured by small, highly skilled, American companies, these guys take care of every employee much better than any of those car factories will.  Why do they even want to?   http://www.sice.oas.org/ctyindex/MEX/MEXagreements_e.asp Paging r/iamverysmart.  I've been in the machining trade over ten years and I am still considered a novice.  I can program, and do full set ups through fixturing, tooling, operating, trouble shooting and maintenance.  I am still learning more everyday and I don't believe that I will ever consider myself a master.  You do not know how complex these jobs are and I find your pompous attitude hilarious. > Nope, but I bet you I could learn within a week easily.  Holy shit, I'm posting this on the board in our shop. This is hilarious, how many years experience do you have in manufacturing operations? Do you even know what [I'm talking about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_control)? How much do you make now? With your self-proclaimed skill set you can be making 30-40 an hour plus overtime with great benefits and you'll only need a week to be good at it.  > A robot  I give you a week to invent one that can replace all the humans needed in manufacturing.  >AVAILABLE TO HUMANS  Like auto manufacturing? Yes still has humans. Median income is the amount that divides the income distribution into two equal groups, half having income above that amount, and half having income below that amount.   It is not real wages per capita.  If we can't agree on that, I can't be bothered to go into the rest of your post, which may actually be 100% correct. Ok, the grand dragon isnt a white supremacist. Have fun splitting those hairs to defend the indefensible  They were involved, as evidenced by the documents declassified last year. Well you're a bit naive if you think that. See that's the thing, NAFTA really hasn't been great for anyone.  So renegotiating is good for everyone.  Trump can go in touting that he is going to get a better deal for the US, Mexico be damned.  And Mexico can come out with a better set of trade deals than before and be like, ""See, fuck that Orange guy, WE DO NOT BOW!""   the US would be far worse off without Mexico. where do you get your data from? the US would lose 16B+ in exports alone, not to mention all of the other benefits. that would crush the US economy and send it into a recession. Mexico might need the US more, but the US sure as fuck needs Mexico. On the upside, a shitstorm of that proportion is the perfect time to leave the Union. Once all is said in done I'm pretty confident that there wouldn't be a union. As a fellow Texan, what the fuck are we gonna do when shit hits the fan? Just escaping Texas alone is gonna be rough. Bullshit I can see the boner in your pants  I'm talking about America annexing Canada and Mexico, respectively. I just don't see any scenario where that would go well at all. Sure ain't. Isn't gonna stop the trumputos from bringing her up nonstop. Lets work backward.  I'm a Hillary supporter, not that it matters, so your wrong about that.  if I think I can?  You have no idea who I am, I could be on a trade delegation and actually am negotiating these things.  Comparable to building a nuclear bomb?  No, a nuclear bomb needs dozens of different little sub-systems to work perfectly or it simply doesn't blow up.  With these things there are various levels of working from perfectly all the way down to poorly.  With this you have a lot of inter-related sub-systems but there is give and take on each.  Longer transitional periods for dairy restrictions, in exchange for higher gas taxes on aviation fuel.  The complexity of these deals is finding a permutation and combination everyone can agree to. New Zealand's government had released the full text since November 2015, they were the first to do so.  The question is where is the money moving to, not where the farmland is. Farmers have been pushed further down the totem pole as corporate owners have moved overseas (taking their money with them). Farm Aid releases a yearly report of what the margin is on farm goods, and even as prices for products have risen, the income for the farmers hasn't. And you're all so fucking nice on top of it. I've yet to meet a mean spirited Irishman inside or outside of Ireland.  Also Hurling may be the most bad ass sport on the planet. How can things be fixed for the rest of the world then? And all of those factors are a great breeding ground for fascism. >Either the world will become more dystopian as fewer and fewer people are able to find more jobs to support themselves and their families  That doesn't make sense. If people can't support themselves and their families, then who is going to buy the products that companies with automated manufacturing produce? I think they've found some loopholes since Asimov's time, need a couple more. I don't know if you know this but our birth rates fall every year. We don't need to constantly expand. The only reason the population expands is because we take in a HUGE amount of immigrants. Most of their education is useless because its third world and so they work jobs that don't need education. We could just stop importing a million people a year and we would be fine. I believe the point is that these people saying ""bring ALL our jobs back"" are asking for something that will never happen. Sure, it's better to have the robots in the US than in Mexico, but even doing that will still leave wide swaths of these former manufacturing workers out of luck.  My argument isn't faulty -- the Broken Window Fallacy is a fundamental tenant of capitalistic economics, it's not some made up this.   Earning more if prices are higher doesn't help. It's a zero sum game and it's why tinkering with things like this often has no real value or predictable impact.   You are right, people oppose raising the minimum wage for the same reason. Raising the minimum wage *is* something to be cautious about. I think a minimum wage is necessary, but often only effective if goods are cheap.  I mean, we both agree that a minimum wage of $100/hour is not realistic. Why is that the case? So we scale it down. 90? 80? 70? Finding the right minimum wage is understanding where that inflection point occurs. It's probably different for different industries and businesses.   A public pool can't afford to pay the 15 year old lifeguards 15 dollars an hour and most of those lifeguards are HS kids on summer jobs who don't need 15/hour.   This is all to say that it's complicated and if you think you have a simple fix you are probably wrong. The anti-intellectualism of ""if you don't agree you are a monster who has abandoned us"" is ridiculous.  The Dems never abandoned the working class -- what do you think the ACA is? The single greatest movement to try to help the working and lower class in like 40 years. If you can make healthcare more efficient you save people money and get them more purchasing power they can live longer and spend more money on things they need.   Of course, Trumper rhetoric worked on you and you believe the Dems abandoned you or something.  Is that true? That's life. You can either adapt to the circumstances you find yourself in or you can make the world poorer because you are unable to compete with low-skilled foreigners. Perhaps if Republicans wouldn't have blocked job training and relocation proposals for years, there would be more options. But no. Now we are talking about how we need to make the world a poorer place for most because a few have kids and a house.  Seriously, what a whiner.  Consider that's exactly what immigrants do.    Illegal immigrants, specially, not only leave their families and social networks behind. They put themselves on a path that could end their lives without any safety net to fall back on.    It's fucked up having to leave everything behind. Everyone has to make a personal choice, on the prospects of a higher wage, or the stability of the current situation.    How can anyone demand the country to regress economically, just to place a comfortable job near you?  Tell me, why does the world owe you a well-paying job right where you happen to live? The world is moving on from unskilled labor as technology automates the manual things that humans used to need to do. Move on, or get left behind. If they're part of EFTA why are they announcing a new deal with the EU? Do you think these are the manufacturing jobs we would win back from Mexico and China? I am not who you replied to and I genuinely don't know.   I thought these jobs that we've ""lost"" to China are more like sweat shop work.  You're right that the other guy is hyperbolic and kinda dumb, but you're wrong about the specifics.  [The US manufactures twice as much stuff as it did in 1984, but it uses 1/3rd fewer workers to do it.](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-manufacturing-dead-output-has-doubled-in-three-decades-2016-03-28)  This is a continuing trend. Output is rising while employment either remains steady or falls. Meanwhile, the population grows. This is not sustainable. Manufacturing isn't leaving the US, it's just not employing people here. [removed] >Median income is the amount that divides the income distribution into two equal groups, half having income above that amount, and half having income below that amount.  *All* statistical ""averages"" do that. That is the entire point of statistical ""averages"". There is, however, a sizable difference between a mean and a median, and which one is appropriate for use is dependent on the distribution of the data set, with median being the go-to measure for non-homogeneous distributions (like wages often are).  Is your point seriously that statistical ""averages"" are useless and we can ignore them? Because that's one hell of a convenient argument that lets you handwave away whatever you find convenient. Are you now going to dismiss your own previously charted graph? Because that too is based on median incomes (albeit divied up into different segments, but nonetheless).  You can't have it both ways. I wasn't expecting an actual argument from you. You obviously are incapable of thinking for yourself. Such a shame.  Mexico will do what is fucking natural. The same that America would do actually. Diplomacy is made and broken on personal relationships, and right now Trump is the Orange guy sticking his middle finger at everyone while grabbing pussies on the side. Nobody is going to run the numbers to get the best deal, that was NAFTA in the 90s, they are just going to say ""fuck it"" now and maybe the Republicans will rebuild this 20 or 40 years from now (since they built it the first time).   I benefit plenty from NAFTA, but I work in tech, one of the industries that the USA kicks ass in. If you are unskilled and dream of working in a sweatshop someday, then ya, NAFTA has sucked for you.  Bones can be terrifying Wouldnt America be spread to thin? I mean Mexicans and Canadians wont just roll over and accept it. The USA would be a very attractive target for say Russia or China Why would they do that? Actually, why are you thinking this might be a possible scenario? Sorry, I'm lost in this whole shitstorm.  But you were talking about China buying up American corporations, that means Chinese money is moving to the US.  Where is the American money moving to?  I'm Irish. Fuck you. > And you're all so fucking nice on top of it. I've yet to meet a mean spirited Irishman inside or outside of Ireland.  The politeness/niceness seems to be cultural. I tried to explain it this way to a non-Irish person: ""What's the opposite of being friendly?"" ""Unfriendly?"" ""No, being neutral.""  Not sure how such a situation came about but happy it did. Obviously we do have our own shitheads and scumbags but the general atmosphere in the country is pretty good. Jesus Christ....hmmm....that is a *long* question which I am probably not fit to answer. I doubt anyone on their own is. Ok I will give it a try anyway.  Overpopulation: Countries need to be continuously developed as developed countries population growth drops off rapidly due to lots of reasons. Provided that all countries reach a specific level of development then overpopulation shouldn't be an issue.  Mass Media: In Ireland Radio and TV are both heavily regulated in their presentation and coverage of news. They are required by law to be unbiased in this, its pretty easy to lodge complaints as well. Gives rise to solid information and debates. Much less interesting sometimes as opinionated articles get peoples' emotions fired up. Newspapers are not required to do so and you can see the difference.  Inequality: A big one on the horizon. If something isn't done about that expect lots of pitchforks to come out in different parts of the world.  I should mention at this point that many countries have a mix of lots of different political/economic systems. Ireland is a mix of capitalism/socialism/etc.  Education: People can no longer expect to remain in the same job for the majority of their lives and automation will make rote-learning fairly low priority . Education that favours critical and logical thinking and innovation is probably getting more and more importance as time goes on.  Politics: I, and many others in Ireland I've spoken to about it, are very happy with our current political system in light of what is going on the US. We have a multiple party system, numbers vary over time, and each party will have some presence in the Dil here. These parties tend to have to work and argue with each other to agree on anything. Since each group has different political agendas and different amounts of the population voted them in it is more representative of the entire population. We've currently a minority government, that is no one party has a majority, consisting of ~9 parties and 18 independents out of a total of ~158. Just getting 7, I think, seats in the Dil gives you speaking rights  there.  As an aside: Our president doesn't have as much power as the Dil so s/he can make a lot more statements/speeches about how things are going, where they should be going and how we should be acting.   So I guess it, I my estimate, boils down to having a well-education population with critical thinking provided with unbiased news sources in an adaptive economy with a representative government with enough checks and balances to prevent abuse. It might be worthwhile to discuss pressures on a population and how they react as a whole, isolationism, radicalism etc but I'm not at all fit to talk about those. The other people that own machines? Why would a factory owner sell to the plebs, when all they can give in exchange is worthless work? They can just trade with other factory owners instead. Asimov's whole point behind I Robot and his other short stories is how dangerous and difficult it is to try and make sentient robots. To have them make moral and logical decisions under the presumption that they will act in the best interests of humanity.  I don't see how that's inconsistent with anything I've said. That's a legitimate solution to solving a decrease in job availability. Decrease population size. Doesn't do shit for any of the people who are currently out of work, however. It's still more jobs than before, plus there are multiplier effects as well for the local economies that suddenly get a new plant.   The defeatist attitude that i see usually coming from the people on the left is ""why bother bringing those plants back to the US, all the jobs will be done by robots anyway."" Which conveniently works out to keeping those foreign sweatshops open, and keep exploiting those people under horrible conditions all so they can keep getting cheap goods. I believe this was explained in articles and videos about why the border wall was useless in reducing illegal immigrants in the US.  Here is a little background on my experiences and why I hold the opinions I have on NAFTA and other trade deals that would gut our manufactuering base.  I am 31 years old and I make roughly 50k a year as a CNC machinist.  I have no college education and a GED, despite this I am not usually cosidered a stupid person.  I got into the trade at the bottom as a production operator, which is what a lot of these people *think* will be automated, and worked my way up.  Being a production operator is very repetitive action, but there are a lot of variables going into this job, like machine maintenance, visual inspection of the parts and gauging.  Automating this position will cost an incredible sum of money and you will still have to have humans on the floor doing a large portion of the work.  From my experience in this field the only jobs that can be practically automated would be assembly positions, which is what you see in videos of lines of robots spotwelding car frames together.        As far as getting jobs back from mexico and china goes I completely believe that not only is it possible but that it is necessary.  Two years ago I was contracted by a company in high point north carolina to relocate and over see the start up of a production cell producing the electronic limited slip differentials for the 2015 corvettes.  The only reason I am needed here is because this area is known as the furniture capital of the united states and they do not have the skill base for automotive manufacturing.  The reason I bring this up is because this areas furniture manufacturing jobs were, almost entirely, outsourced about fifteen to twenty years ago.  There are abondoned factories everywhere and most of the people who worked in them are now working minimum wage jobs in the service industries.  The cost improvements has not effected the cost of furniture enough to balance the debt being accrued by subsidizing these peoples cost of living, via welfare and food stamps.      I don't work in a sweat shop and the people I talk to down here miss these jobs terribly,  so I am assuming these were not sweat shops either.  As far as I see it when the government signed NAFTA they started another war on a concept.  The ufortunate fact is that blue collar workers were collateral damage in their get rich quick scheme.  People in this country were doing fine before we outsourced the jobs and they will be fine after the jobs are brought back through a policy of aggressive tariffs.  Edit: I don't know how I got that font in the middle paragraph.

I'm going to Manila to visit family in a few months and I'm a little worried because of Duterte's ""war on drugs."" Adolf Duterte Duterte did say he's open to accepting refugees. Well if being suspected is enough to be murdered, me as a Dutchman would be basically committing suicide the moment I pass airport security. This is what a real ""war"" on drugs looks like.  A war on drugs is a war against the people of your nation. I am Filipino. There are a number of us who do not support this President. Definitely, he is the worst we have had. He did not win by majority although there about 16.7 million that voted him into office out of the 70 million that voted. He won because of propaganda and hiring thousands of trolls. These trolls are documented and obviously still doing his propaganda work. Those that think he is the best thing that has happened to the Philippines need to re-think where their sources of news are coming from or re-think their values. The Philippines is not safer. Genocide is what is going on there. Also, this President is supporting the family of dictator Ferdinand Marcos. In fact, he ordered the burial of the dictator in the cemetery for heroes effectively spitting on the victims of the Marcos years and revising the history of the Philippines. He disrespects women, religious leaders, and any one else who does not agree with his opinions. Sounds familiar? He even blatantly disrespects the Vice President who is vocal about respecting the rule of law and human rights in the Philippines.  This has grown to be so messed up that the rest of the world has just decided to let this tire fire burn itself out. ""suspects killed""... I can't even muster the courage to read such an article. And think about it... drug users shouldn't even be in jail! What one does with his body should be his own choice. he can just ""claim"" his entire opposition are drug dealers and after they are shot dead with no trial he will have nobody to challenge him. rip philippines.  ""Possible"" EJKs are real, just like the WMDs in Iraq.  /s Let's be real. It's a crime against humanity to put anyone in jail for drug offenses. ""Possible""? The crimes against humanity are just ""possible""? Shit, a few months worth of that IS a small town's population. Should go talk to the locals over in the Philippines and see what they think. I'm sure they have a very different opinion. Every native i've spoken to loves the guy. People cheered on the streets when he came into power.  This isn't a drug crack down, this is population control in a largely Catholic country. Better to shoot them than to give them birth control.  And yet people will still say that Trump is worse.  The stupidity of their government is astounding, all of the drug abuse combined probably doesnt even come close to touching the damage they are doing to their own people by murdering drug users    *""oh you put something we deemed illegal in your body? Better kill you to make sure you dont hurt yourself""*  smfh  [removed] that's just wrong. who cares if they do drugs The scary part of this, he angrily [admits that 40% of his own police force is corrupt](http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/597555/news/nation/duterte-slams-pnp-as-corrupt-to-the-core).

Well of fucking course it's a crime against humanity when you're purging the population of suspected drug users/dealers just because you have it out for them and are a bloodthirsty tyrant. Hope someone assassinates him before this goes even farther. I wonder if jail's are privatized in PI ...  This was shit the moment it started. People take a while to figure what it really means to abandon rule of law. It's hell, and it's gonna get obvious soon enough. Yet no calls to ban their president from visiting other countries or to have flight attendants not work on flights to the Philippines. Funny, that.

Not to mention he said he wished he could have been first in line to rape a missionary with the rest of the town, or that he called the Pope ""a son of a whore"". Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ, I thought that this type of behaviour from a government could only come from a North Korea. I guess I was wrong Where are the protests for this?  If youve never been to the phillipines, then something like this will surprise you.  Im half and I went two years ago, our taxi man had to buy coffee for a police officer because he ran a light that turned from green to yellow.  the police officer said, ""youre lucky im not asking for a pastry with my coffee"".  Its sick This is going to be the US soon. If oil prices were in jeopardy, we'd be so far up his ass he'd have a southern accent.  I'm ok with this. I'm ok with this. I'm ok with this. I'm ok with this. I'm ok with this. I'm ok with this.  I'm ok with this. I'm ok with this. I'm ok with this. I'm ok with this. I'm ok with this. I'm ok with this. I'm ok with this. I'm ok with this. I'm ok with this.  I'm ok with this.  I'm ok with this.  Where are they burying all of those bodies??? This sounds like laying the ground work for UN intervention. It has more to do with him severing ties with the US than his drug war.  Compare the Trump threads to this one and it illustrates why I have a hard time taking anything political seriously at this point.  According to reddit Trump is ""literally hitler"" every time he makes a change, which is marked by multiple threads with thousands of replies.      This guy commits genocide and 30 people comment to voice their concerns.       I feel like our priorities are all fucked up.  Objectivity took a backseat a long time ago and now everything is predicated on some sort of emotional appeal  A few months ago I remember arguing with the Filipinos on reddit that this vigilante justice is absolute nuts and they kept saying ""you don't understand what it's like there. Duterte is going to clean up the country"". Wonder if they're still saying that. Possible war crimes? Possible???  Nothing 'possible' about it. It's a feckin' dead cert. His end will come in a gruesome way Spoke to a Filipino worker in Singapore about a month ago and she was of the opinion that Duerte was the best thing since sliced bread.. she was gushing over how he is helping he country and getting rid of the criminals who are poisoning her countrymen.. maybe we are hearing one side of the story only..  US and other countries are waging war on drugs for decades where millions innocent people died and nobody tries to call it 'possible crimes against humanity'. Double standards... >possible crimes against humanity   Would even conceiving of this carnage, let alone tolerating it, from a democratic state even have been possible ten years ago? The world has gone mad, we are losing our moral compass. ""Possible""? Pretty clearly crimes against humanity. This is so ridiculous. I know so many Filipino people and they are so kind, calm and collected. Cant believe this could be happening in their country. I guess it is the age of Trump, Modi and Duterte where an extremist personality can lead a mob of people down some shady alleys. Scary times we live in.... I know is dangerous..but i lived there for 20 years.. And alot of crimes involved are drug user...espicially all of the drugs user protector are police.. some police now they killed thier person who give them money for drugs to protect them. Now Duterte do an action for these set up of his police man.. But i hope you understand guys isn't easy to stay in philippines before because of alot crimes..but now it's ok to stay there..media are bias..you don't know what Duterte good deeds do to his fellow man. Its a massive purge of political rivals and dissidents.  This is probably driving up the prices of pot to crazy prices.  And in an amazing coincidence, [vigilante killings have gone way down](http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/597791/news/nation/lacson-notes-commendable-coincidence-of-no-vigilante-killings-after-pnp-halts-drug-war) after the government announced a shit to focus on corruption in the police force.  But nope, the police aren't involved in the killings.  Nosiree. Isn't he still considered popular in his country?!? Right of man. Why no Democratie left get upset ? Duterte is actually invited to the White House personally by the President. He was already congratulated for a job well done. Purging the country of trash, it might be inhumane but it sure is efficient. Awww, people who destroy others lives are being killed. What a terrible shame.   This dude does not give a fuck. Fucking fantastic. Give this guy a medal. Purging scum of the earth drug dealers/associates, fantastic. Keep it up.  We can blame this on Trump can't we? Phillipines is the Asian Isis.  I'm sorry but I like it it's very democratic; jury of your peers no government interference no scumbag lawyers. I mean some people can just just use some killing is all I'm sayin you can clean alot of trash real quick and cheap to. If this was offered as a votable thing count me in. My town could use some tidying up. This is Trumps fault.   THIS IS TRUMPS FAULT!!!! If you kill all the poor, everyone will be rich!      It's genius!      Wait... My mother-in-law is an immigrant from Manila. My husband has been wanting to take me over there but we will not go with this leadership... Its just too dangerous.  As surprising as it may be, but there are punjabis in Manila, who are mostly money lenders. And lots have been killed, as it is an easy way for filipinos to get out of the debt. Duterte has been creating criminals instead of the wipe out he promised. It is unimaginable thinking there are people who now have killing experience, and normal people will have PTSD from it too.  A journalist friend of mine got shot because she spent her life trying to expose corruption of a local politician. This happened before Dutertre, people being gunned down unjustly in the Philippines is not a new invention My fianc lives in Valenzuela city, I feel for you. I'm hoping to get her over here before Trump starts to screw with Filipinos.   Were they gunned down by the police?  Can you clarify?  This is the deal, if you take the rule of law away, then who gets to determine who is or is not a bad guy? The bad guys do..... Trump is president, no one cares about anything anymore, nothing makes any sense, trade your money for spacebucks and fly to the moon. I have a good friend who has family in the Philippines (mother, and brothers), he talks about this guy as if he's a great hero who is cleaning up the country. I just can't help but cringe when he does this. Far as I can tell from various articles is that this guy is a tyrant. The guy's in his seventies...  Duterte has a heavy handed and downright insane approach, but people are willing to put up with it because of how much Filipino society has deteriorated.   The fact is that Duterte turned the city he was mayor of on Mindanao island (the name escapes me) from the murder capital of the Philippines to a pretty orderly and relatively safe place. If you're unaware of Mindanao, you've probably heard of the MILF which is a rebel/terrorist organization from the island.  I don't claim to know all the details, but it's much more convoluted than people in the west would like to admit. There have been real social problems that have been ignored for years and its all coming to a head with Duterte. For the record Duterte is anti-Communist. > This man is just executing who ever the fuck he wants in 2017. He just calls out a name and cops rush over to a house and within seconds they execute him.  Trump 2020! I cant wait!   Sure, it's hyperbole and a joke. ..or perhaps it's not funny anymore?  As anyone who is familiar with [Vladislav Surkov's method of controlling the narrative in Russia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od4MWs7qTr8) , will know, Bannon's tactics are eerily similar.    Exert from the film regarding Surkov's strategy:""his aim is to undermine peoples perception of the world, so they never know what is really happening"".. (the first press conference the Trump administration had, was to lie about easily verifiable facts- i.e. the crowd size, then began to talk about alternative news- Surkov play book 101) ""Surkov changed Russian politics into a bewildering constantly changing piece of theater"".. ""he backed all kinds of parties from socialists to skinheads"" (no evidence of this, but I wouldn't put it past him)..""the key thing was, that Surkov let it be known that is what he was doing which meant that no-one knew what was real or *fake*""  ""as one journalist put it- 'It is a strategy of power to keep the opposition constantly confused, a ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable, *because its indefinable*""     Vladislav Surkov is to Putin a modern Goebbels. He helped him change the Russian constitution so that Putin could become President for life. Could Bannon do the same? I doubt it, but 1 year ago I couldn't imagine any of this. America. You scare me. >Lets assume for the sake of it that drug dealing is an offence that could put you on death row. >Still, these are suspects. Not convicted criminals.  Don't forget to say that it would be murder to execute people for being involved in drugs. You seem to be under the impression that it matters if they are just suspects or not. Guess what, this isn't America From what I remember reading this President has a pretty big following actually....  Philo? When did we start calling Filipinos this? Your friend isn't wrong. It is not good now, but it has been worse  We know we have been told this since it was a twinkle in Duterte's eye and he hadn't talked to God yet and just wanted to murder drug traffickers instead of users. We're going through a world-wide outbreak of 1930s. What Americans don't understand is that the Philippines simply doesn't have the resources for the justice system to be able to handle a drug epidemic. So everyone whines about human rights.   We have the resources and justice system capable of handle a drug epidemic, but they simply don't. Resources are so much scarcer over there it's not comparable to a western mentality at all.   It is a risky system of crackdown he's implementing, meaning it can be abused. But people support it for a reason. There's no other way to deal with the epidemic that is damaging their country. Under the quota I guess yes, possible, because (differently from Duterte's regime) we held people innocent until a trial. Never. He could triple the killings and there'd still be plenty of people willing to buy/sell drugs (and that's assuming that everyone he kills is involved with drugs which I suspect is not true in most cases). You simply can't solve the drug problem or the corruption problem this way. Going after ""corrupt"" police is the next step Use alternative facts to accuse random people of being drug dealers. Anything to satiate his right wing lust for blood. He was about to move on to Indian moneylenders before everyone remembered that the police force was utterly corrupt. that's assuming all people killed are drug dealers and not just rivals or people taking opportunistic murders. They can keep calling and killing innocent people drug dealers.   It's like Salem witch trials. Call someone a witch and let the mob do the rest  You should worry about your mental health instead, the crazy drivers and the horrible traffic can be quite grating. Keep out of the slums, don't do drugs or go looking for drugs, act confident and do not show money (watches, phone, wallet, expensive clothing or accessories).  Pretty much safer than it was before the elections (politicians paying assassins to gun down other politicians etc)  Why would anyone go (unless family) to this country given the climate of things? That would be kinda stupid.  Foreigners are now fair game for extortion by the cops, who use the drug war as a tool to arrest whoever they want. Google Jeremy Eaton, Damian Berg and jee ick-joo.  Also you'll be fine if you're white. The Philippines is still very colorist. You may overdose on mamsirs or sirmams, however.  Still ok. Keep a low profile, don't go out with people you don't know, stick to the tourist traps unless you have someone with you who really knows the place. Just got back for the holidays, pretty safe especially if you're staying in makati/sanjuan/Taguig area. Laguna is safe too. And below commenter are correct on colorist. If you're white your g2g to hunt? or replace the dwindling population?  So, one could say that you're the Flying Dutchman? What do we do? Assassinate him and put in our own martial law to replace all their corrupt police we'll need to jail?  The world has always been messed up. Only difference is now we hear about it quicker.  Unfortunately it does have grave implications. I'm Mexican, for example, I wish drugs were at least decriminalized to hit the cartels in their pockets. In the meantime, I say screw you to anyone who contributes to their economy for they have wrought terror on us, imagine waking up and seeing people hanging on bridges, soup made with rivals and sometimes innocent people who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. Imagine knowing that your government contributes to this economy or at least stays out of the way. Politicians and policemen bought. Duterte is one of the few real solutions for the short term.  Actually rampant drug use is indeed a huge problem in the Philippines, don't pretend it's not a plague that needs to be put down. Especially shit like cocaine which can ruin lives and families. Sure you can argue what the drug user does is based on his/her own choice, but what about their children or other relatives whose livelihoods depend on them? All this is the prime reason why Duterte was elected in the first place - people wanted to see real action taken against drugs, though this is clearly not the way it should be done.  Edit: I still believe this whole war on drugs is wrong and Duterte should be condemned, I'm saying that drug use still needs to be solved one way or another. The problem with this mentality is it opens the doors to violent offenders to use the whole ""don't blame me I was on drugs"" excuse.   While I do believe we need to decriminalize certain drugs(marijuana being the main one), we need to crack down harder on people who take certain drugs while fully aware of their potential side effects(for instance, ice. In the last two years were I live, which used to be a sleepy town in North qld Australia, there's been a woman who murdered her kids and a man who decided to cut his best friend into pieces and stick him in an esky).   People need to be held accountable for their actions, or drug related crime will just continue to climb its reaaaaal lol /s Making and distributing should be jail. User should be treated medically  Have you considered that maybe Filipinos are stupid to be supporting this guy? I'm Filipino and Duterte also gets a lot of hate. Go to /r/Philippines. The thing is, this drug war has only affected a small minority, so the lives of the majority didn't change. People don't care about others until it's their rights that are being violated. Well, luckily the phillipines isn't a world superpower that has a major influence on global politics and economies.  They know exactly what they're doing. It's just a power grab I agree with everything you said except you make the same mistake when you say duterte is committing genocide. Learn the definition of that word. That's not at all what's happening. It just sounds dramatic so people way overuse it. One of those leaders effects the entire world the other, just his people. There is a very big global concern regarding trumps actions. Like it or not America's actions never just involve America and it is not a nation where it's people can tell the world to mind it's own business as everything it does has ramafications well beyond its own borders.  Well, it's because 21st century neo-liberals only give a crap when it happens in their back yard. 3rd world atrocities? Eh, it's a shame but as long as it doesn't stop my supply of iPhones and cheap plastics i dont care.   Edit: I love it. Another neo-lib trait is to be hyper sensitive to critique. So far y'all aren't letting that stereotype down.  There is a disconnect between us and them. We fight for us, not them. We fight to keep ourselves from being them. I'm not saying that trump Is on par with Hitler; however, having concern of our system evolving into a country that enables shit like Duterte's rule is valid. We should always be mindful of the course we set.  Not that I support Duterte at all but he has quite a high approval rating, as opposed to Trump USA? Are you joking? Dutarte severed ties with the US during Obamination. Lol this is terribly uninformed Having lived there my surprise was that he went after drugs without really going after graft.  When you get to the top many are the same people.  Corruption and population are the two biggest problems.  Focusing on drugs doesn't fix anything long term especially going after the lower level people since that is just domestic demand.  The stuff is still manufactured.  Recreational use of drugs like marijuana is incredibly popular.  You can ask for it at small stores.   or maybe she's deluded, and hasn't had an innocent family member gunned down yet? She's right maybe?? There is one hell of a difference between working someone through the judiciary after the passage of legislation, and shooting someone in the street ""because they are involved in drugs."" Quit it with the useless false equivalency. Bullshit they dont. Even the UN and the WHO have stated this. Oh so edgy... you should be a celebrity advocate or something, because your world view is so unique and insightful!  Look where ""You're either with us or against us"" lead the USA.  Casualty in the millions and no one bats an eye. Filipino people are super friendly.  It is the kind of place where you take a flight to and by the time you land people on the plane have already invited you to dinner.  People in general are also more happy and content with what they have compared to westerners.  The country itself can be hard and harsh.  It is a land of contrast.  Somewhere like Tondo is not really where a foreigner can go.  Trouble is always readily available but just unlikely if you take some care.  Still anyone can have their jeepney held up by bandits.  Police killing people to avoid a trial has always been a thing.  The odd shootout always happened.  Drug assignations always happened.  It is really just an upscaling of what was happening on a smaller scale. English, please.  When I lived there I felt safe.  You really had to be involved in drugs or politics to bring on serious trouble.  Now though the Police are targeting easy victims for money.  I would be far more wary of being extorted by authorities. http://politics.com.ph/davao-is-number-4-on-pnps-worst-ph-cities-with-highest-crime-rate/   http://www.philstar.com/nation/2016/04/02/1568394/murder-rate-highest-davao-city-pnp   It's easy to like Duterte if you only listen to his supporters. Because I am sure everyone executed was actually a drug dealer and not targeted for some other reason like political retribution. Just nuke the entire country. No drug dealers left, right?  That's 100% efficiency. Yeah except he's also killing a ton of innocent people as well. Get fucked. Not sure if 'trolling' or just stupid... probably both, that's what happens when you do drugs....  Someone please kill this stupid drug addicted troll trash of a human being plz.  Fucking worthless piece of shit, the world will be better off without you \\\_()_/  You are the pure definition of an idiot. I hope that makes you proud. God I just feel sorry for you, who hurt you? Your embarrassing as a human. Why do individual drug users, many of whom will have complex reasons for doing them, deserve to be killed?  Dealers deserve to be punished, although I still don't think they should be killed, but why the fuck do the users deserve killing? No, but both are part of the same radical populist phenomenon.  No. It's just a similar thing happening elsewhere. People are pissed off with ineffectual and corrupt politicians and elect a totally crazy one.  Humans are just atrocious at picking leaders worth a shit. Trump said Duterte is a good leader who is doing things the right way. I feel like you'd feel differently if someone in your family was murdered for drug use (either correctly or mistakenly - there's been innocent people killed for drug use when they've never taken any) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_4J4uor3JE ""Efficiency and progress is ours once more"" ""Kill kill kill kill kill the poor, kill kill kill kill kill the poor, ahahahaha!""~Dead Kennedys  Same boat I am in. My wife wants to go back but her and her whole family just won't. They aren't very open about talking about it either. They kind of know how bad it is and the embarrassment/disappointment hurts them. LOL oh please, you sheltered people who live in the internet. Been in the Philippines for 3 months, walked around the slums at night, jepney, motorbike everywhere, never felt threatened or in danger once. In Manila, Cebu, the cities around them, and smaller islands. > As surprising as it may be, but there are punjabis in Manila, who are mostly money lenders.  And Duterte's starting [bitching about them](http://news.mb.com.ph/2017/01/11/arrest-deport-those-involved-in-5-6-lending-scheme-du30/), too. Not new but it does appear to being a lot more frequent now. Sorry about your friend.  I agree.  Never been there but did some work with a female lawyer who was gunned down as she sat in her car.  I heard about it via email and started googling to find out more and the photo of her slumped over and bloody body in her car was virtually the front page of the news sites.  Shook me up.  Such a waste.  This was before the purge started.  That's one movie I thought would remain just an interesting idea. No they weren't. But there was no follow up investigation as far as I know. It could have been just a typical act of violence killing but I feel like the attitude of the police force is one where they don't care about justice anymore. Wtf has trump got to do with the Philippines!?    ONE MILLION SPACEBUCKS?! WE'LL BE ABLE TO PAY OFF PIZZA THE HUT! Yeah because he's got so much to do with this...  Gattica, here I come. Oh good this is about America  I thought this wasn't about America and I was like freaking out  As much as I hate trump, he's still a ways off from ordering the killing of civilians. Though I could see him doing some shit like this with ""suspected extremists"". It's reminiscent of the red scare in a way. Where does one purchase these spacebucks you speak of?  Quit the melodrama it's not that bad. I'm certainly pessimistic but at least I know not to catastrophize and buy into this narrative that everything is terrible. We could certainly get there but it's not inevitable. The overwhelming majority of people that live there support his actions. They voted him in power on his promises.  If you breath, eat and sleep in the trenches like they do, you too will have the same opinion. If you kill everyone you suspect of being involved in crime, and don't consider doing so a crime itself, you're definitely going to end up with attractive statistics. I'm from the Philippines and this Davao bullshit being a orderly and a safe place is just no. It is a City Number 1 in unsolved murder (due to the Davao Death Squad). If you piss of the wrong kind of people you will get tagged as a criminal and get killed.  How can you trust any stats coming out of mindanao? Is some statistician in the Philippines going to put out anti-Duterte stats? Duterte will have the statistician killed for 'drug use'. So was Hitler, so it's not exactly a good thing in itself. For all we know Duterte profits from the drug trade and has been eliminating key rivals in all the chaos.  The man is hooked on fentanyl by his own admission.  He's dirty to the core.  They don't even need Bannon. They've already got Surkov. The internet makes it easy to operate in the US, and even moreso than any literal hacks, this is how Russia is hacking our country. This is ""fake news."" What is Russias endgame?  [r/unexpectedfactorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/unexpectedfactorial/) > Guess what, this isn't America  You seem to be under the impression that due process doesn't exist in the Philippines. You are wrong.  Kayo ay ang nakakatuwa. Kayo apos y mangapapahiya Doesn't matter that much in America. He took the presidency with something in the upper 30's of the vote. Iirc he had a very large popularity rating in Davao where he was a mayor in.  the support he has in comments, reddit, facebook, etc. it's totally nuts  the people have no fucking idea.  it's similar to the situation in the usa.   certain groups of people only listen to information coming from single sources, like breitbart... they believe anything printed there even though it's very often completely wrong. Really common in Australia. Not derogatory, [just another diminutive.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminutives_in_Australian_English)   Usually spelt 'Filo'.    Here in Aus that's what my mate calls himself  I won't even talk about how killing drug addicts is on the same ethical level as killing the mentally challenged, handicapped or otherwise disadvantaged, and reminds me a lot of a certain ""final solution"". What Duterte supporters don't get is the part where no amount of drug addiction and crime can justify a totalitarian regime, because the latter doesn't in fact control crime and corruption, it just monopolizes it and thereby puts every single citizen in danger and turns any sort of perceived freedom into a farce. In totalitarianism, dissent is a crime that earns you the death sentence, and dissent is redefined whenever the government sees the need for it. There is no guarantee that it won't be you or someone close to you tomorrow. Actually it wasn't worse. It was pretty much the same. You're just more aware now. So what is stopping someone from killing someone who isn't a drug addict and claiming that they are one? Nothing. Due process of law is essential to a fair and just society. Claiming that drug addicts are irredeemable and should be killed because the government can't afford it is pathetic and totalitarian no matter what country you live in. It doesn't solve the problem of drug use and it doesn't do anything to stop the flow of drugs in that country. Ruling based on fear is not a solution to a problem. ""Whines about human rights"" fuck you and people like you. Why should one criminal epidemic be replaced by another, only under the guise of being just? You know why people are saying it's ""better than before""? Because everyone else is dead. *pained laugh* Nope, you cant What it does do though is push drug dealers back underground, makes the drugs harder to find (less dealers on the streets peddling to whoever has the money), and makes addicts think twice about running around in the streets Haha, I've been a few times before, so I'm aware of the traffic. I can deal with it, as long as I'm in an FX cab.  I've been to Manila a couple times before without any worry. I'm not usually a paranoid traveler, but it seems like there's been more talk of kidnappings and shootings at people's homes. I don't -think- my family lives in the slums and for the most part aren't the type that would have grudges against them, so that puts me at ease.  The tropical islands (Palawan, Bohol, Boracay, etc.) are still safe. From what I understand, Cebu is still fine, as well. People have been traveling to significantly more dangerous places than the Philippines for forever. For the most part, as long as you don't do anything stupid, you'll be fine most places you go.  Things seem a lot worse in the news than they are in person. > Damian Berg  Australian arrested and framed for selling ecstasy. Police lied under oath about where and how he was arrested. [Charges dropped](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-12/cctv-frees-adelaide-man-framed-on-drugs-charges-in-philippines/7925200) after video proved their testimony false. (Shows how utterly stupid and savage the ~~police~~ thugs are there.)  > Jeremy Eaton  Arrested on same night as Damian Berg and charged with being involved. Was arrested first. Given *life sentence*. Could he actually be guilty? Sure - but everything is tainted by the current regime. IMHO, the police have zero credibility currently.  > Jee Ick-joo  Korean business man who was detained, beaten, killed, burned, and his ashes flushed down a toilet. Wife was extorted for a large sum of money *after* he was already dead (always demand evidence of well being). This is the case that caused the tyrant to actually suspend the carnage *temporarily* and tell the police to clean up their own ranks (surely will be effective, not at all).  I would not travel to the Philippines now. Philippines has always been a somewhat dangerous country, but mostly between rivals over power. Previously, if you weren't in the southern areas with active Muslim separatists, and you were just a nobody tourist passing through, you were relatively safe from anything except petty scams, pick pocketing, or a snatch and run robbery.  In any case, tourists should boycott the country to send a message that all those tourism dollars are a stake if the madness continues.  How's Quezon City? I'll be staying there for the most part. I don't know exactly where, but I know for a day we'll probably be staying in Sacred Heart. Damian Berg is white and was arrested in Makati Lets hold back on that one until he starts killing. Tripledolf Dump. He needs refugees so he can pick them up using his helicopter..  Omg lolol that's horrible but hilarious  Just accepting immigrants on the condition that they participate in ""the hunt"" and survive Well if he visited PL and they thought he was in any way involved with drugs, he'd be the dying Dutchman. Well, they wouldn't be wrong... Fuckkkkkinnnng nailed it - savy? Hell no. We tried that a few times before. Either they figure it out or China is gonna roll in there. How is decriminilzing drugs going to hit them in their pocket.  It will still be illegal to smuggles drugs from Mexico to the US, and that is where all if the profit happens.  Also the various Cartels will still fight/murder/control much of the drug trade.   He never said it isn't a problem. That doesn't change the fact that people shouldn't be put in jail let alone be killed for it  Legalize and educate, it's how you solve most problems in life. I see. Well, you might be right in that it's a problem that needs to be solved. Maybe it's like cigarets and gambling, only poor and less educated people are attracted to it anyway. For me, this would be a big issue, since this category of people needs to be protected against themselves more. I'll give you this, it's hard to formulate an argument against, I don't even know where to start. Everything is wrong.  Ok you are technically right in that he has not targeted a specific ethnic  group or religious group,  however he is allowing murder carte  blanche with drugs as a thin veil to disguise it.  The end result of both situations are lots of dead victims :( I get that,  but how about some honest discourse on his policies?   I get that people are against his stance on immigration,  but what I hear is him being called a racist instead of presenting a logical alternative approach to immigration.      Based on the outcry I have seen, my assumption is that their stance is that all people should be let in the country to stay for as long as they like as long as they promise to be really nice. That sounds kind of naive to me.  Not everyone wants to play nice.  Some people do want to harm us, dominate us, overthrow us.  Why do so many people want to pretend that evil like this doesn't exist anymore? Sorry, are Reddit filthy disloyal anti-Trump lefty socialists or neoliberal corporate-loving globalists? I'm having trouble keeping track of the latest alt-right rhetoric. ya, it's only the ""neo-liberals"" that do this. republicans won't buy themselves *any* luxuries as long as there are starving kids in Africa lol it's not valid to say we are evolving to where dutertes policy is possible here. We are simply nowhere close to that. Cut the melodrama. If you kill everyone that disagrees with you,  your approval rating will always be improving I don't know... I was of the opinion his people hated him and I was kinda surprised to hear different You're probably right because her family isn't a bunch of degenerate druggies. Who knows! She was really praising him Also there is a difference between suspects and criminals.  Most of these people, are executed within seconds of their arrest. Oh don't make me laugh, what about so called ""no knock"" raids when police kill people suspected to be involved in drugs? What exactly is false?  Username adds up. If you kill the women and children then the children can't grow up to do drugs and the women can't birth a future drug dealer.  Use your head for once for goodness sake. Even as a joke that's awful.  nice b8  No one. Are you standing up for drug dealers and associates? So similar.  Genocide vs. a policy shift.  They are the same exact thing.  Well that's a start.  How else can we tie Trump to this? Im assuming you were born with English as your first language, and do not speak any of the languages used in the Phillipines. Please correct me if I'm wrong.  Well man, I'm sorry, but I cannot just take your word on your anecdotal evidence. Just because its not an obvious occurance to you, doesn't mean its not happening.   The fact that you spent your 3 weeks there traveling extensively  actually weakens your claim. What local would trust you enough to bring up something so politically dissedent as Government-endorsed vigilante killings? Furthermore, what would be the point? You're a foreigner who will be gone soon anyway.   Likewise, the people you can talk to,  the people that can speak good English, likely use that skill to do business with foreigners. Why would they want to scare away their source of livelihood?   Well  He's a man of the people at least. Christ.  Oh, they're preying on the poor.   Honestly, no compassion from me. Thwy shouldn't do that, but I don't care if it happens.  ""Moreover, Duterte also allegedly hopes to leverage business linkages with Trump to bolster U.S.-Philippine relations. Dutertes personal envoy to Washington owns the Trump Tower in Manila.""  http://www.newsweek.com/how-will-trump-duterte-get-along-534375 He's pandering for upvotes Yeah Trump is so much worse than a dictator with murder squads killing anyone that speaks out against him while he uses the excuse that they are drug addicts.  didnt trump praise this guy? i feel like i saw something about that a while back He's responsible for everything that happens in the world - both good and bad - due to his new position as (arch traitor/god emperor). Just ask the 13 pro/anti Trump subs I've got blocked so far. Absolutely. I think trump is turning the White House into amateur hour but he's not a fucking fascist dictator, jeezus. ""I believe it is peace for our time. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Go home and get a nice quiet sleep.""   I think a more accurate historical comparison is filthy appeasers sticking their heads in the sand, while Western Civilization marches ever faster into a global conflict. The 50's were prosperous and the West wasn't in decline!  CIA blacksite approval seems roughly equivalent to saying idgaf about human rights to me. You go to the spacebank, they have an exchange fee but it's worth it. Sounds like Hitler. In a few years they will all say that they never actually supported the guy. Yeah but their justice system is not capable of handling things like ours is. They simply don't have the resources like we do. It's a very poor country. You can't apply a western mentality to it. It's definitely a sketchy policy he's doing. But I don't think it's so easy to condemn. Not in itself or ever. No, he's in the Philippine Democratic Party, and in the 80's he was a member of the Davao Death Squad which murdered members of the New People's Party, a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist organization. > He's dirty to the core  He's definitely dirty, but so are the other options. Our ""best"" candidate in my opinion (Miriam Defensor Santiago) had cancer and died a few weeks/months after the election.  edit: added this section: The presidential candidates were (**in my opinion**): edit 2: formatting, sorry  1. Mar roxas - A symbol of the establishment party (Liberal Party) in which people were very dissatisfied with because of perceived mishandlings of various situations such as the SAF44, and has bad PR because of some ""publicity stunts"" he pulled. As to whether he was genuine or just acting, I never really bothered to check. He is quite fairly accomplished in his own right.  2. Grace Poe - An ex-American citizen with no experience, she denounced her American citizenship to run as the Philippine President. Her claim to fame is that her father (Fernando Poe Jr) ran and lost a very close election in the past, who also died a few weeks/months after.   3. Jejomar Binay - An ex-mayor of a very prosperous city (Makati City) like Duterte, but is racked with corruption allegations left and right.  4. Rodrigo Duterte - A mayor of a fairly successful city (Davao City), but has an unfiltered mouth and is known to be violent/brutal against criminals and offenders.  5. Miriam Defensor Santiago - She is a very accomplished and outspoken woman, but had cancer which she ultimately lost to. RIP  People just picked what they thought was the least poisonous for them I guess.  He WAS hooked to fentanyl when he had a motorcycle accident.   He no longer is addicted to fentanyl.  He now uses heroin (okay this I made up loll) What does every crooked ""leader"" want?    Money, power, control, domination etc....   Supposedly Putin already has the money so it's probably mostly power and control.  People being executed on one mans word would suggest he is right. i find it really interesting how much support someone like this can get. There was obviously a *massive* problem with drugs in this small country. It's sad they couldn't come up with a better solution.  Like Reddit.... A good number of those FB, youtube, etc ""support""comes from bots and fake accounts. There are studies now and investigations on it by many media groups, here in the PH too. And those ""trolls"" are swaying public opinion because people are bandwagoning.  It's because people are sick and tired of the current system in their respective countries, and are willing to latch onto anything that promotes change..   Having said that I'm a fan of duerte, I've seen the effects of ice first hand...  I guarantee the effects of drugs(referencing ice here specifically) on a community are worse than what he's doing LOL judging by your post history you're some nerdy fuck who has never left America.. probably never left your state? Let alone been to the Philippines.  There's 100 million people living mostly on a few tiny islands, with extreme poverty most people make a couple American dollars a day. Things don't, and can't operate the same way they do in the West. It's a third world country. Duterte has made it safer. If you don't do shady shit you don't have to be worried. Sorry. You're right I meant 'Filo' Wow, that really hit the nail on the head, I use like 3/4 of those. Yep, this world hasn't turned to shit recently but with the advant of global communication and media we are a lot more informed. You addressed none of my points Well I shouldn't have criticized ""whining"". The concern w human rights is fully understandable. But I really don't think applying an ultra modern American notion of justice to their situation is worth much. Why would it do that when there are a ton of fresh vacancies at the top and nobodys got control the market...?  The money that comes from dealing in the illegal is just too good for desperate people to pass up. Be careful in Manila although nothing really has changed, and avoid the south n you'll be alright.  I live in the Philippines.  The thing that always gets to my nerves is the Traffic. :/ I've been hearing sirens - police and ambulance night and after night since this operation started.  It does not seem worse when you live in the affluent parts.    But people are more scared right now for their safety (poll taken recently).   The Chinese community have reported an increase of incidents of extortion and kidnapping by linking the victims to the drug trade.   The kidnapped Korean who was killed was taken from Angeles, a city north of Metro Manila.    Places like BGC, Ayala Avenue / central business district Makati,  and gated communities are safe for now.   You just don't want to caught in the wrong place at the wrong time so try to stay in safe zones like malls and touristy areas.    The more affluent parts of the metro are relatively safe. If you're worried about rogue cops, since the announcement of the cleanup of the police force, ""vigilante killings"" have coincidentally subsided.   QC is primarily a residential city, and armed robbers & burglars are still the biggest threats. Just remember to lock your place, park your car in a well-lit area, don't venture out too late alone, don't flash your cash, don't wear expensive stuff- usual precautions. No only that, but decriminalizing means they'll be able to continue without fear of getting arrested. that is like, your opinion, maan He did say that ""drug users shouldn't even be in jail"" which implies that he thinks drugs should be legal because ""what one does with his body should be his own choice"". I'm not supporting Duterte, but something needs to be done. Drugs should not be legal, especially the harmful ones like cocaine, ice .etc. >Legalize  The backlash from the conservative bloc will be immense, it would be political suicide to suggest it, and the bill won't even pass because the other politicos want to secure the next election for their son or party.  >educate  With what funds? Except that's not how it works there, Philippines is significantly less developed than the West. There's way too much people and, like I mentioned, drug use is rampant. People can buy illegal drugs right off the streets and use them on the spot. You can't regulate these by simply telling them that drugs are bad.   Edit: Yep, downvoted for talking about *facts*, typical Reddit. sure,  inner city Chicago residents don't agree with you. *edit..  it isn't only the drugs that affect people, it is the violence that comes hand-on-hand with the drug business It's not Carte Blanche murder either. There's a method to it, although a method with conflicting incentive structure. Yeh I just heard a speech from Clinton during his presidency where he advocates the exact same crackdown on illegal immigration as trump is saying, except the building the wall part. But the general crackdown is common sense. These idiots cry ""racist"" at everything even tho one of their heroes advocated the same thing. Apart from Trump being a giant douche (I realise it has nothing to do with his policies, but seriously, even before any public political ambitions the guy has always been a tool) him being elected president has been quite shocking to the world. So his policies will be scrutinised quite heavily in general.  Now for the actual reason why i believe his immigration policies are misguided. The world is in a state of crises and the most powerful nation in the world who amongst others has in many ways the cause of this humantiarian crises stood up and absolved itself of all responsibility. The war in Syria particulaly is a direct result of US meddling and the aftermath of the Iraq war. Throwing bombs on the former country is a stupid solution but to wash your hands of responsibility is rather atrocious.  I wouldn't even try man, they don't know what any of those words mean, might as well be synonymous.  > neoliberal corporate-loving globalists  This is a normal Democrat.  >  anti-Trump lefty socialists  This is a Bernie Bro.  This seems pretty simple to figure out. Dunno why you need the help of an alt-right neo-Republican. I love that you assume I'm alt-right. Just because I offer a pretty valid criticism of the neo-liberal establishment doesn't mean I don't support most of the ideas inherent in the philosophy. One incredible socialist mind, Noam Chomsky has this to say on neoliberalism if you'd like to read up.   http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Chomsky/NeoliberalismPOP_Chom.html Lol. I didn't include them because they don't pretend to care.  You're throwing straw, man. True, but he hasn't killed nearly enough people for that to be the case. The sad truth is that a large amount of Filipinos support him. It's disgusting. and you're probably one of the more idiotic people ive replied to today. Congrats. Dude the guy brags about straight up murdering people.  Its definitely not as systematic as in the Philippines , theres even 'vigilantes' killing people in the streets When i was arrested, they didn't shoot me on the spot. Also, it was cops that arrested me.  If I was in the Philippines i would be shot by my neighbor because he smelled pot. When i was arrested, they didn't shoot me on the spot. Also, it was cops that arrested me.  If I was in the Philippines i would be shot by my neighbor because he smelled pot. Quit trolling.  In no way is the US war on drugs comparable to the extrajudicial mass murder of suspects by vigilantes, going on under Duerte. What the US is doing is terrible I think most people can agree on that and I haven't heard anyone here say otherwise. What the Phillipines is doing is kind of different and much worse.  Such a lame comment. Every time someone comments like that I can't help to think of how so average the person behind the comment must be.  well to be fair he is not wrong and it is the quickest way to get a result.  Sensitive much?  I am. Especially mere drug users though.  More so against vigilante justice on suspecion of drug use wether it be weed or heroin. I read even acting a certain way could get you killed. Executing people on suspecion is alright with you? Way to completely dismiss that lol. It's 3 months, and I was just talking about personal safety.. Dude! Are you kidding? He said like something sexist and something possibly racist! He's a threat to this planet and its people! He took a congratulatory call from him. Doesn't hate em. Trump called his people monkeys ^(you've made enemies on both fronts. your only hope are the neutrals from the neutral planet.) I have to block like 3 subs (Hillaryforprison, T_D, and conspiracy). Every fucking week a new anti-Trump sub pops up. It's really infuriating. Filtering the word ""Trump"" with RES, combined with blocking the following subreddits has vastly improved my reddit experience.  /r/atheism (Low effort trash)  /r/conspiracy (Self-explanitory)  /r/creepy (crappy)  /r/dataisbeautiful (propaganda is beautiful)  /r/Drumpf (Trump spam)  /r/EnoughTrumpSpam (Trump spam)  /r/Futurology (Misleading headlines)  /r/gaming (Low effort trash)  /r/hillaryclinton (Trump spam)  /r/HillaryForPrison (Trump spam)  /r/Impeach_Trump (Trump spam)  /r/MarchAgainstTrump (Trump spam)  /r/me_irl   /r/nosleep (crappy)  /r/PoliticalHumor (Trump spam)  /r/politics (Trump spam)  /r/rupaulsdragrace (This is legitimately the only one I feel bad for filtering, I just have no idea if it's a show or something so I figured I'd filter it since it wasn't relevant to me)  /r/The_Donald (Trump spam)  /r/TrumpForPrison (Trump spam)  /r/Trumpgret (Trump spam)  /r/TwoXChromosomes (I am not a woman, I figure I'd respect their space) I briefly read spacebank incorrectly...  I was only following orders. Well, Duterte did compare himself to Hitler Of course it's easy to condemn. You can sympathise with certain limitations that make prosecution difficult, but you can't defend this version of ""justice"". The solution to not having the resources for a trial and prison sentence isn't assuming everyone is automatically guilty and allowing the police and regular citizens to be judge, jury and executioner. Yes again, the point is that just hating communism isn't enough. Tyranny comes in different flavours. Idk the Wikipedia page says it's a left wing party that follows theism and socialism Miriam was great but I really questioned her choosing the son of Ferdinand Marcos (the late dictator of the Philippines btw) as her Vice President. That really convinced me not to vote for her.  He admitted that's addicted to it. That stuff is *stronger than heroin*. No you're right. The other guy is misinformed. >He couldn't even afford to run a campaign during his Presidency campaign and a lot of overseas Filipino workers helped fund his campaign.  One of the cardinal rules for a con man is that you never let your marks see your true self, and you let them pay your way if possible.  People being executed on one mans word suggests that one man is a tyrant. It's a right declared in the Filipino constitution which is currently being violated. People being executed on one mans word suggests that one man is a tyrant. The population of this ""small""  country is nearly 100 million people. and the area they have is approximately the size of Japan. So I don't think that *small country* is suitable definition for Philippines.  We tried, but the courts are also racked with corruption. With Duterte's passion, I would have preferred Duterte to focus on government corruption but alas his sights are set on drugs. Less than 5% of population illegal drug use. Seriously a lot of the anti trump posts you see here link to news articles that are a complete joke. I am critical and skeptical of trump like anyone else but at this point I'm tired of rolling my eyes so much at some of the shit you see. If trump is going to be a failure let him fail first so we can move forward. cartels exist BECAUSE of the drug war abuse is WORSE because of the drug war  good job ignoring the effects of alcohol and tobacco btw  you're manipulated by drug war propaganda and ignorant about the drug war and its consequences.   just google that  ""drug war consequences""  or ""drug war not effective""   WTF are you serious? So condoned killings just based on accusation is better than the problem of ice? You assume this is going to fix the ice problem... spoilers, it's not i know more than you about the drug war and its consequences.  you are fucking wrong so you get over yourself.  google it.  So what do you think is the worse culprit, drugs or poverty? OK so with it illegal everyone can buy it anywhere.... how is it being illegal helping at all then? There is a drug business because it's illegal?? Okay, but you still haven't even offered a solution.  You just called Trump names and then criticised him for how he has handled the Syria crisis after 2 weeks in office.  That is just appealing to emotion.  Trust me I get that he is abrasive and does unlikeable things, but how can anything change if the only answer is name calling and criticism?      How about a realistic alternative plan?  You didn't even address that aspect of my reply and I feel like it is the most pertinent thing discussed. Yes this is very much the case. I am half Filipino and my family really don't seem nearly as phased by it as I am. My uncle for example is jaded by the way drugs affected his childhood and I can see that in his despair he is ready to accept any solution to the problem, even though it is so extreme.  That doesn't mean I agree with him, but I was born and raised in Australia and he was born and raised in the Philippines. I think that this situation is incredibly concerning and inhumane, but if he is a democratically elected leader with a high approval rating I'm not sure if it's really my place to interject... But doing the same without bragging is alright...  Oh yes, pointing out that the US is no different is trolling. The difference is that in the US vigilantes have uniforms. I guess it is alright then... ;) It is not, innocent people die, are locked up or have their lives ruined in the name of war on drugs.  Well your name describes you perfectly I was just giving you a compliment calm down. Nah I just guess everyone here is American and despises the Philippines, so it follows that everyone will be upset at my comment. People use every opportunity to mock and insult the Filipinos and suddenly someone stands up and defend them? No way! They must be downvoted! You stand for cartels. You stand for people who destroy addicted peoples lives. You stand for murder, trafficking and gangland wars. You stand for money at all costs.   Im the bad person.  Yes.  Well it's not true haha He did much more than that, if you'd actually listen to the guy. This means he is best friends with him and they go out and play golf and shoot the shit all the time. Trump is literally friends with hitler. The mainstream media and reddit agrees with me. Trump is going to start doing the same in america but with gays, atheists, muslisms, blacks, mexicans, and trans people. Snopes said so, that makes it fact.  /s If I don't make it, tell my wife hello. /r/rupaulsdragrace is a show about drag queen's competing with one another and being judged by Ru Paul to win prizes such as money and cosmetics.  I'd watch it at least once before filtering it out of your life forever. It's an experience.   Lol, proclaims he hates sooo many subs and then takes his time to list in great detail all the subs he hates and provides links. Topkek material. > /r/rupaulsdragrace (This is legitimately the only one I feel bad for filtering, I just have no idea if it's a show or something so I figured I'd filter it since it wasn't relevant to me)  It's only the best show EVER. And the only show I bother to watch really. Nobody cares  ""Evil is not when bad people do bad things, but when good people do bad things"" I never called it justice. They can't afford justice. Hard addictive drugs are destroying their country like an epidemic. You either allow it to continue ravaging your population, or you institute a radical solution. There's no option of handling something like this with their criminal justice system and poverty of resources. You're applying a western mentality to the situation.  It's certainly not a perfect solution and it's very prone to abuse. The incentive structure means some innocents will die. Also addicted drug users will die rather than just drug pushers. So I can't say I support it. But I wouldn't condemn it either. It's not ""assuming everyone"". There is a level of protocol to who can be shot. For example, women assassins are paid to go and pretend to buy drugs but then kill the dealer. So that's not killing just anyone. There's a method to it. One or the other, bub. Their party platform is something like the Burmese Way to Socialism, in that it ain't getting there. That's a very valid concern too. None of them are spotless, after all, some can say that she benefited from Marcos' martial law which can be considered as being opportunistic depending on the lenses you carry.  If by stronger than heroin you mean you need less of it to feel the same effect then yes.  That doesn't really matter though in the world of drugs.  Plenty of things require difference doses, that's just the nature of the drug.  By that logic LSD is one of the strongest drugs on earth, but it is also one of the safest drugs on earth too.  Not trying to play devil's advocate, just trying to say dose of a drug doesn't really mean anything in terms of dangers.  Just to put things in reference:  Heroin standard dose is 5 - 40 mg, fentanyl standard dose is 25-50ug (1000x less than heroin) and LSD standard dose is around 100ug.  To give another comparison why dose doesn't matter.  Xanax has a standard dose of about 2mg, which is way less than heroin but nowhere near as dangerous  If you mean that it is more addictive than heroin, then that's an issue, but I doubt it's more addictive than heroin--probably similar though Agreed. But it should be noted that this tyrant has a lot of popular support - a majority according to opinion polls, if I'm not mistaken. Well,  he should have just bundled up the corrupt officials with the drug dealers. 2 birds 1 stone. /s He has already failed though. Sorry about your eyes. Some people want him to fail so bad, even though they live in the United States... Like come on people do you really hate him that much you are willing to tear apart our country?  Alcohol is impossible to ban(to easy to make yourself) and tobacco, largely, only hurts the person who consumes it, so more power to them.   I'm not manipulated by anything, just sick and tired of seeing the damage ice and coke wreak on the streets  Legalize non harmful drugs(ie pot, properly made E etc), and throw the book at fuck heads who knowingly consume drugs that have a history of inducing violent behavior in addicts No, but I support the death penalty for people who habitually use the shit and deal it  Legalize less harmful drugs then go apeshit on hard drug peddlers and users.   Seriously, fuck em, they are well aware of the potential to lose control and hurt society from the use of the drug... I feel no pity for them Lol says some sheltered stoner boy in his parents basement. I'm in the Philippines rn, google confirmation bias, and autism. Unfortunately, you cannot just lock up the poor to look like you're doing something for the community.  Targeting already vilified criminals is much easier. I'd say they go hand in hand. They exacerbate each other and creates a downward spiral. People who tend to do drugs are poor to begin with, now they're addicted to expensive stuff like cocaine (I heard a single gram goes for $60-80 in the US, not sure in the Philippines but sure as hell ain't cheap) which is obviously going to send them deeper into poverty. And because their bodies are inevitably ruined by drugs, they cannot work and hence they earn no money to support themselves or others, usually ending in tragedy. That's why I say it ruins families too, especially if the drug user is the main source of income for their family. Ever heard of gangs/mafia? Or the black market? I'm saying that potential drug dealers are everywhere and it's incredibly hard to regulate (they usually meet in alleys or secret places). Getting caught with drugs on you, however, is effectively a death sentence even before this whole war on drugs shitshow. Many Southeast Asian countries have the death penalty for selling drugs. In a third world country? Legalizing would just legitimate the cartels without really changing anything. People's lives would still get ruined from OD and violence  Having worked in a developing country for a while, these places don't work the way the developed world does. What appears to work in the US doesn't necessarily apply to the rest of the world for a variety of reasons The solution is the exact opposite. Currently the American government is making the worst humanitarian crises since the holocaust worse. A situation which they are majorly responsible for. Instead of flying planes to drip bombs, fly planes to rescue refugees, instead of sending ships to blockade send the to collect these desperate people and help them.   8 million people have fled into europe and around the world. This requires a compassionate military response. Help these people. It's definitely your place to interject. Murdering innocent people is still wrong *even if* the majority support it.  But I suppose if your family are permanent residents here in Aus then they probably can't vote against Duterte in the next election anyway, right? So it's probably pointless to upset them.  >ready to accept any solution to the problem  The stupid part is, it's not even a solution to the problem. :/ He could triple the killings and PL would still have drug issues (especially because many of the murder victims are not involved with drugs). More like alt right you deplorable piece of trash Yes but they still aren't being murdered in the street without trial, kind of a major difference. Oh did trump come out and say that? I honestly didn't see.  What? Let's see what's worse than having killing squads murdering innocent people.  I believe you're missing the sarcasm.    This is good timing my breakfast needed a little salt.  Why do you folks get so heated and jump to defend this guy? A rational person wouldn't dream to put him on a morality scale. Why don'tcha google ""Trump on Duterte"" and get back to us? Probably worth noting at least.  > ""Moreover, Duterte also allegedly hopes to leverage business linkages with Trump to bolster U.S.-Philippine relations. Dutertes personal envoy to Washington owns the Trump Tower in Manila."" > http://www.newsweek.com/how-will-trump-duterte-get-along-534375   Duerte on Trump: ""He was quite sensitive to our war on drugs and he wishes me well in my campaign and said that we are doing, as he so put it, 'the right way' ""   that's what im talking about, lop What makes a man turn... neutral ^(hey bb is me, your husband.) Hold up dude, I'm hitchin a ride up to where the trump dont shine I'll look into it at some point, I was just very, very confused when I first started seeing posts about it. I thought it was about racing, but then it was people in drag and I didn't know any of the context. but I mean now we can make a throwaway and block all the same subs and live vicariously through him Opposite actually, haha. I just don't like 60% of my all page littered with low effort Trump spam (T_D combos, ETS spamming BS, politics linking huffpo unironically, etc). I actually lean right, I just have a separate account for when I post about American politics. Not everyone. Just your enemies. I mean the potency of the drug in comparison to heroin.  Comparing an opioid to LSD is like comparing apples to a tee shirt. There's no common ground.  Who does the polls ? Well if you murder every one who doesn't support you you're left with a lot of support. Or you're left with people that lie on opinion polls because they're afraid of the guy that murders everyone.  Didn't he do that? Claim political enemies were drug dealers? He did. meth is easy to make yourself and only affects the person who consumes it (the rest is caused by the war on drugs)  alcohol is a violence inducing drug.  prohibition?  nothing about the situation was improved.   alcohol and tobacco kill more people than meth.    you're not manipulated-fine.  but you're still unaware of what things are caused by the drug and what things are caused by the war on drugs and the black market.  The problem is is that it obviously isn't just drug users and dealers who are being targeted. That's where a policy like this really fails whatever you think of drug users/dealers' rights. The accusations are so easy to affix to people. I bet you're a real fun guy. i guess to make your country better all the people LIKE YOU are just going to get murdered  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-38823938   They exist because it's illegal.... I'd say it's clear as bad as drugs are, drugs being illegal just makes them worse. Because your treating a symptom and not the root cause. I'd bet if they focused on other things they might see drugs become less of a problem. Why Syria?  Why not Venezuela, North Korea, Sudan, The Congo?  It is easy to moralize and say ""we should do this"", but lets talk about practicalities.  Lets say we take in the refugees.  What do we do with them then?  Provide indefinite housing, health service, education, and food?  Okay that sounds nice, does that mean we are writing a blank check here?  Do we set a cap at how many we take in, only to eventually alienate the ones that are beyond that number?  Do we take all of them regardless of the financial burden?  Are we setting any expectations on them as far as following an American system of government, or will we make further concessions if they voice concerns that it may inconvenience them in some way...what if they complain that our good will is too oppressive to the way of life that they had formerly known and start making further demands? [This article](http://www.dailywire.com/news/5388/islamic-preacher-british-muslims-demand-sharia-law-michael-qazvini) is an example from UK.    If we don't plan to have them permanently settled here, then what is the plan for transitioning them back to Syria?  Is America as a nation really willing to take those hard steps to ensure that Syria is well governed and safe for its citizenry at large?  That would most likely require a strong military response, which right now with the political winds blowing the way they are, would be just another excuse for people to fan the flames of what ""lunatic Trump"" is doing?  Furthermore, we already spent so much time in Iraq and Afghanistan that I don't see whereas the people want to step into yet another Middle Eastern engagement.      Honestly I agree with the content of what you are saying.  I want to help people, it is what makes us most human, however I think that this beautiful ideal is cheapened when we use it to pass judgement without considering the implications behind what that help involves.  There is a certain subset of that society that wants to do very real harm to our society.  We have documented empirical evidence of this truth, therefore I don't think it is unreasonable to ask the question -- if we decide to help these people in need, how are we going to protect ourselves from that subset of individuals that want to do harm?  I also believe we can consider this question without donning the jack boots and suddenly stripping the rights of the citizenry, however I don't see anybody having this conversation.  Our society is currently name calling and drawing battle lines based on whether they identify with the left or the right.  Can we put on our big kid trowsers and start doing some adult work here, instead of fighting like toddlers in kinder?       And let me say thank you for at least being willing to discuss this with me. Lol we are not ""majorly responsible"" for Syria. I know we've fucked up in the Middle East but we are not responsible for everything. They cause a lot of their own problems. I agree that it's not going to solve the problem. I certainly do vocally interject, but I mean if for example the UN or a government power were to interject it would cause further issues for them to overthrow a democratically elected leader You say all about muricans double standards... But in the comfort of their own homes. Not much of a difference. I must have misunderstood the conversation. Trump has not said that.  No, the sarcasm is the problem. Who are you talking about. Because of the circlejerk here, honestly. I maybe checking how much the word Hitler is being thrown around since trump was elected, just to see the jump on the chart.   edit: [Here you go](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/5rhzea/last_8_years_of_hitler_mentions_on_rworldnews_oc/), unfortunately, I didn't have the data after 2016-11, so this doesn't prove my hypothesis, still kind interesting though, hope you like. because he's a brainwashed high school student who loves fantasizing about trump because his anonymous buddies on the internet told him he's gonna make everything better and that hillary had emails I agree they aren't the same.  I'm just trying to say the dosage of a drug doesn't really matter at all in regards to the drugs being bad.  Sure, it's stronger if you compare mg to mg, but that really doesn't matter at all except if you take a heroin dose of fent you die, but you die in many cases for taking the wrong dosages. Who is gonna say they don't like him lol. I believe so. The scary thing is is that, apparently, no one is really investigating the names. It's been more of a shoot now, ask questions later.   People are fed up of the corruption, so many turn a blind eye.  Unfortunately,  I'm woefully ignorant of this issue so I don't actually know...  Lol what? Meth use affects the person taking it, the family members and friends near them, and when large enough members of the community get a taste for it, the community at large.   BTW I'm not a fan of prohibition, pot should be legalized, alongside most of the ""lesser"" drugs.  By doing this you free up law enforcement to actually effectively tackle the problem, unlike what's happening here in northern qld(aus) currently.   There was a bunch of high profile brutal murders up here last year all involving meth(one was a mother off her head on ice deciding her five children really needed to be stabbed to death with scissors), so they send in drug squad police from down south... So what do they do? They run around busting pot dealers, since they're less likely to get shot...    That's the thing, just getting ""tougher on drugs"" achieves nothing, we've only got to look at the US for proof of that(unless your trying to run a modern day slave trade involving prisoners, in which case it could be argued it works too well)   It needs to be a balanced and nuanced system, ie legalizing the shit that doesn't have any real detriment to society(which frees up the legal system and stops victimizing 90% of drug users), and coming down harder on hard drug pushers  BTW I think you were missing the point I was making.. I couldn't care less about people who only hurt themselves... It's their life, they should be able to live it how they choose... It's when ones actions affect society, and in the ways that drugs like ice do, that I feel there needs to be a proportionate response...  True, but then again, treating the root cause is a luxury a lot of these countries have trouble affording.   At the end of the day, promising increased funding for education doesn't win you elections, being hardcore anti-cartels does >Why Syria?  Why not Venezuela, North Korea, Sudan, The Congo?    Syria is the crux of the issue. The current crises can be attributed to this war. A war the US is involved in. I'm well aware that there are opportunists walking amongst these refugees including other nationalities, economic refugees, islamic fundamentalists etc but they do not make up the bulk of the millions fleeing.  >It is easy to moralize and say ""we should do this"", but lets talk about practicalities. Lets say we take in the refugees.  What do we do with them then?  Provide indefinite housing, health service, education, and food?  Okay that sounds nice, does that mean we are writing a blank check here?   That would be good. Especially considering that events such as this should be considered when your nation is partially responsible. But this issue is not just America's problem or fault. It is a global issue therefore a global response is what is necessary. However the US is the leader whether they like it or not and must take the intiative. What Britain and America have been doing in the wake of this issue is quite distasteful. Turning your backs on desperate people from the aftermath which the West has caused is possibly the exact opposite response that is needed.  >Do we set a cap at how many we take in, only to eventually alienate the ones that are beyond that number?   Actually I'm not stating anyone takes them in per se. What I'm saying is that a global militarised compassionite response to the crises instead of allowing nations to unilaterally decide how they treat these people. If that means setting up camps in various participating countries then do it. Why not use the military to help in stead if fight?  >Do we take all of them regardless of the financial burden?   The financial burden of refugees should be priortised over the burden of unnecessary military conflict which this has caused. Although what came first, the chicken or the egg? This, I'm well aware is the biggest issue but definately not unfeasible if it is a multinational effort.   >If we don't plan to have them permanently settled here, then what is the plan for transitioning them back to Syria?    When there is stability then they can be resettled.  >Is America as a nation really willing to take those hard steps to ensure that Syria is well governed and safe for its citizenry at large?   This is the problem right here. It is the fact that America willing attitude in the first place that got the world into this. Why did America feel that Assad was bad enough to stir such instability? Why when Isis cause millions to flee their next reponse is to attack Isis resulting in more refugees? Why when this happens they give these people the cold shoulder when they are running away from a situation the west has caused?  I can't see how what America is currently doing beneficial for anyone including Americans. It will do absolutely nothing but stir up the pot. You have to be kidding. Where do you think ISIS came from? Do you think they originated in Syria? Or could it be perhaps the 100,000 Iraqi special forces that mysteriously disappeared during the pointless Iraq war had something to do with it. Who do you think planted the seed for regime change? Syria is all kinds of fucked up almost entirely because of Americas meddling. I am being generous by not putting the entire blame on the US but alas they aren't commiting the atrocities they just caused them. Some people do die because of it, and those that murder them are not being held accountable ad they should be I agree, it's still a long ways away from it being legal to murder them whenever you want. Duerte claimed Trump said that to him, I never saw Trump refute the claim although it's possible he may have. Yeah, well, the topic is a man who will applaud the extrajudicial execution of a pot smoker all the while he spends his time getting recreationally high on a drug that has a very low lethal dose threshhold.    I'm just calling out his hypocrisy.  meth ABUSE is what you're talking about.  otherwise it is a legal pharmaceutical prescribed to millions of people.   alcohol is identical...  but you can seek help for alcohol addiction and those around you are willing to help.  you're not bankrupted by alcohol either.   prohibition exacerbates instances of abuse.            prohibition and the drug war is what is hurting society that's my point.  otherwise the all the drugs are only hurting the user (if you ignore the actual costs to society, but then junk food costs even more)  you mentioned the effect on a meth user's family.  economic due to the inflated price of meth.     what is the nature of alcohol crime?  people don't steal alcohol because they can sell it and they don't steal money so they can get alcohol.  the same goes for a loaf of bread.  meth crime? you have a huge amount of property crime by individuals unrelated to the effects of the drug.  and then there's the black market activity doing even more...   if meth and alcohol were both equally legal and equally priced then you'd see the alcohol problem is larger than the meth problem.   OK so people are screwing themselves by voting politicians in that serve themselves and not the people, like a lot of countries. It seems you don't have to be a poor one to suffer from that. Answer me this: why haven't you invited homeless people to your home, clothe them, helped them find jobs?  Because that's essentially what you're asking. Some of the homeless aren't mentally stable, most of them are harmless.. further more Money from the government doesn't grow on trees. Refugees are a drain, it's not a guarantee they will get jobs and integrate. Isis didn't cause the Syrian conflict. Syria was in civil war before Isis came around. The US is not without blood on its hands but it's not like the whole thing is our fault. Well, it is not - that's just your whitewashing I'll drink to that Meth is nothing like adderall I don't think you can compare the too in any way unless you are ignorant. Just because they have similar chemical compositions, doesn't make the two anything alike. Nope, I meant direct effect due to the increase in violent behavior exhibited by meth heads (https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-05-methamphetamine-linked-violence.html)  I've never said alcohol isn't bad, I've said that it's too easy for people to make(unlike any half decent form of ice, which almost requires a degree in chemistry to make, I know this since I was involved pretty heavily in ice in my teens), all you need is some brewers yeast(easily available anywhere), sugar, water and a water distiller(can be had on ebay for ~50 depending on where you live), no advanced understanding of chemical compounds required  One factor your leaving out is the prevalence of alcohol compared to ice... If you ran the stats of the percentage of alcohol users who commit violent crime and compared it to meth, you'll find a much higher percentage of meth heads involved in said crime   People do steal alcohol to sell... People will steal anything to barter if they're desperate enough (ask me how I know)   I don't disagree with black market crime, hence my stance on legalizing ""lesser drugs"", create a legal, regulated market for it, like in Colorado for pot... Not perfect, but miles better than what we got  And nope, meth will always create more crime per capita of users than alcohol, it's just in the way it affects the brain.   Excessive doses of adrenalin coupled with lowered inhibitions is a disaster for pretty much anyone Actually my families prime occupation is to find and house homeless people so that question isn't really relevant to me. I see your point however that is not what I'm asking to do. I'm asking the parties responsible for the crises to take initiative in solving the issue and supporting the people who are suffering as a result.     I didnt say ISIS caused the civil war I said that ISIS are made up predominately of former Iraqi troops who fled and went underground during and after the Iraq war. The civil war was caused when syrian acedemics began prostesting against assads rule. The protests were insighted by the US. Just like Ukraine. The following chaos paved way for ISIS and other fanatics whom took advantage. Like I said if the US didnt stick its nose in then Syria would still have stability and you wouldn't have 8 million people running away looking for a safe place. Haha OK man your right they are the exact same. 
"
"8",7,"5r8rit","2017-01-31","For clarity, it should be remembered that [this petition](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/171928) DOES NOT seek to stop Trump coming to the UK.  It seeks to stop his visit being a State Visit, instead being treated as a head of government visit. Britain should detain him at Heathrow on the grounds he poses a security risk, just for lols. Trump has to learn that there are consequences to his actions. The US people voted him in with 'America First', which is fine and is their democratic right.  However, the rest of the World, UK included, does not have to agree that they come SECOND to the US in their demands.  We also have to answer to our own moral compass. Yes its warped, yes our own PM just negoiated an agreement with Turkey and Erdogan - practically a dictator in Turkey, but this is the view of the British public, not our 'representatives'. (I put that 'representatives' in quotes, because this Government was not voted in, it was succeeded. Personally David Camerons blunders should've triggered a General Election, which while the Conservatives would have likely still won, it would've answer the question on their mandate to Govern.) Isn't the Monarch supposed to be the one who invites other Heads of State for a State Visit. Can the Parliament overturn the decision of the Monarch? This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38814346) reduced by 74%. (I'm a bot) ***** > The debate, on 20 February, will also take in a second petition calling for the visit to go ahead, signed by more than 100,000 people.  > Prime Minister Theresa May, who met Mr Trump for the first time last week, has invited the president for a state visit - the highest honour accorded to foreign leaders - with no date yet announced for it.  > Support for a petition calling for Mr Trump&#039;s visit to be downgraded from a state visit, which usually includes a ceremonial welcome and a state banquet, soared after the president announced his travel ban at the weekend.   ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/5r91w1/uk_mps_to_debate_donald_trump_state_visit/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~56171 tl;drs so far."") | [Theory](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31bfht/theory_autotldr_concept/) | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **visit**^#1 **petition**^#2 **state**^#3 **Trump**^#4 **president**^#5 In the scheme of things. How would this actually get discussed in parliament? Could it be added as an AOB item if they are not overrunning time? Or as a item placed for a dynamic discussion by MPs eg straight after PMQs. That title made me think that they were going to have a debate with Donald Trump Debates that usually go nowhere. UK is not in a position to snub the US right now. I'm pretty excited to see how this one turns out. What would happen if the British gov actually refused his visit? (Like that's going to happen) you can't just give a middle finger to the American gov by extension in times of crisis. I hate trump but am a realist, what the petition asks for will make things worse. Omg guys get over it, it's just 4 years If anyone is interested in how the rest of the country (the ones that aren't petition warriors) feel about things, a YouGov poll just came out.  ---  Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom should...  * Go ahead: 49% [58%] * Be cancelled: 36% [42%]  ---  Most people don't wish to block the state visit, although you'd be forgiven for getting the contrary impression from the UK media. I must admit I'm not an entirely politically minded person before asking this question, please be gentle as this could be a great learning opportunity for me.  The UK just elected a right leaning populist leader who is putting the UK's priorities, namely immigration, ahead of the entire remainder of Europe.  The US just elected a right leaning populist leader who is putting the US's priorities, namely immigration, ahead of the entire remainder of North America.  Shouldn't the US be fairly well received by the UK, excluding the fact that currently both countries have a fairly vast population who dissent/resent their leadership?  edit: got my rights and lefts mixed up! Oh god that is like 1/30th of the population Just want to remind everybody that you did not have to be a uk citizen to sign that petition. Were there any similar petitions to ban Obama from meeting the Queen? Banning Trump only validates the ignorance they are trying to protest against Always debating those MPs in Parliament. They must be masterbaters at this point.   #HAH yeah but they let muslim terrorists in? genius! I am pretty sure US doesn't need anything from the UK. Trump can grab her by the p***y and take what he wants. Also for clarity, 1.8 million people is a lot but it equates to ~3% of the total population of Great Britain.  1,800,000/64,000,000 = .028125   ""UK MP's to debate Donald Trump State visit, after 3% of the British people sign a petition asking for his visit not to be a state visit.""  Whats the difference? As i'm not sure what the exact difference is? But why? What is the difference and why do they want that to happen? Just curious, is it common for leaders of countries that the UK is traditionally allied with to get denied a state visit?  Like, is it a special occasion, or does every other US president get one when they come? UK is good friend with the Saudis and other dictatorship but suddenly Trump is too much? Sooo... all this rabble behind this situation is fucking pointless? if only they were so offended when their gov sold arms to turkey and saudi arabia.. oh fuck I would love that. ""Mr Trump, please come this way, something seems off about you and we need to do a cavity search"". That would be glorious! xD  But you forgot, ye's too recognizable for anybody to give a shit. Do you want to cease existing as a country? 1.7 million does not make Britain. Just the Muslim population is more than that. While this is not necessarily false, you should keep in mind that the principle doesn't just apply to the US. A theatrical gesture might make a certain segment of the UK populace feel better, but it also makes a genuine breakdown in relations that much more likely - and the UK's already pretty fully committed, diplomatically speaking, with Brexit; alienating the US at the same time would be something of an act of madness.  Pretty much the first thing that Trump did when he got into the office is dig Churchill's bust out of storage and put it back on display; there's obviously a store of good will that you guys should see as a strategic resource.  We're also talking about Trump here. Do you think he'd really let it end there, be the bigger man, and go on with life? Or do you think he'd do something ridiculous in return? I know which one I'd bet on. >However, the rest of the World, UK included, does not have to agree that they come SECOND to the US in their demands.  What? Seriously?  ""I know you want to care about your family, bu ME, you NEIGHBOR should have PRIORITY! Now give me turkey.""  You need to rephrase that, man. Hello. American person here. The US people did not vote T.Rump in. They voted Bernie Sanders in but Russian hackers and Cambridge DataSniffers interfered and 23% of persons too isolated and aliented from reality to protect us from T.Rump voted him in. As far as I can tell, but then again the best part of my consciousness is probably living in a parallel universe. Not in the UK. The Queen, while nominally the Head of State, has little real power and it would be up to the Prime Minister around whether a State visit would go ahead. She doesn't decide who she meets they do. From what I understand, the petition calls for the the government not to ban Trump but to refuse him a state visit which is often given to world leaders. This involves meeting the queen, getting a procession and a banquet and whatnot That's what I meant, sorry for not clarifying. My point was that symbolically this will be an insult in trumps eyes. I mean has there ever been a us president who was refused a state visit and had to downgrade? What's the sample size my boy Damn, 70% of the country supports Trump but is too scared?   Fuck up. Magic numbers out of thin air! How did you get them? TIL: I'm a bit. you're quite out of spelling ability Yes, quiet, on an anonymous petition site where there's a counter-petition running at the same time (with far fewer signatures, I should add).  I'm not sure which leader in the UK you are talking about, but no election was held for Theresa May. The Conservatives were voted in, and after Cameron's resignation she was selected. Corbyn is left-leaning, very much so, but is not the leader of the country. May is a Conservative, and is right-leaning.  Trump, by all standards of the UK, is on the right of the political spectrum. His policies, clearly taken from those on the ""alt-right"", a group generally considered to be far right, oppose the policies in the UK.  Both are widely disliked, and a lot in the UK strongly sympathise with Americans: their dislike of Trump nevertheless remains high. The current petition alone shows that much.  May is aiming to be close to Trump, due to the strong need for close connections post-brexit, due to the reliance on trade, but a fair amount of the population believes that British values should not be forgotten to strike a trade deal. Neither of these countries have left leaning populist leaders.   The UK's government is your standard Tory conservatives, not even populist. Also they have been in power for nearly 7 years, not just elected (however Theresa May took over after David Cameron resigned, but that wasn't an election outside of the party)  Trump is absolutely not left leaning and I have no idea where you got that idea.  Ehhh I think that's right-leaning, especially for Trump  (Right usually means conservative) Not to my recollection, Obama was more widely received in the UK than Trump.  That isn't what the petition is about though is it. It's not a ban. The first line of the petition is:  > Donald Trump **should** be allowed to enter the UK in his capacity as head of the US Government, but he should not be invited to make an official State Visit It doesn't seek to ban him. It seeks to stop any visit he makes being a State Visit. He would just be a head of government. You better believe the government is taking note, 1.8 million is alot of people as it reflects the public mood. Compare that to reddit or any forum, the amount of people that lurk but the percentage that actually comment.  Incorrect numbers, ~11,000,000 are 15 or under from 2011 data. Sure some teens may of voted, but to claim 64 million is just incorrect unless you think babies and small children are capable. Also you would need to calculate the population who actually have access to the internet.  3% of the population signing a petition is *huge.* A relatively small number bothering to voice their concerns in this way represents a much larger number of people in the wider population. Just in the same way literally ten people writing in to protest the content of a television advertisement can cause a regulator to ban it and fine the broadcaster. The number of those willing to speak out against the wrongs of society is very few. Their protests represent a much greater problem. Are they all UK votes? A lot of the signatures were not from the UK.    If I was good with JSON, I could probably parse the data, but unfortunately I am a code dummy.     Downvotes? But it's all in the json file, provided on the website? k More importantly, anyone can fill the petition. There's a simple email confirmation, and you get counted, so a large % of that number are just trolls from outside of UK. He can come but he can't meet the Queen. A state visit is considered a very high honour,* as they are hosted by the Queen, and isn't usually afforded a president until a couple of years of their term at least.   A head of government visit is really just business.  It seems likely that, given May's poor handling of the Brexit situation, and subsequent need for a trade partner in the US, this is being offered to Trump as an inducement. It also seems like just the kind of high profile, pomp and ceremony thing Trump's ego would crave.  * FWIW, I'm strongly anti-monarchy, so to me it's a pretty meaningless and frivolous exercise. However, as it's regarded by those making the decisions as something that matters, I oppose the government offering to a person like Trump. Not common at all. Pretty much any visit they make in an official capacity is a state visit. That being said, it's usually much later in their tenure. For example, Obama didn't have a state visit to the UK until a few years after he was elected.  More info on it here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38808647  As this says, these state visits have been used politically over the years for all manner of unsavoury characters, Trump just being the latest.   Given the extreme proximity to some of his actions and policies though, and the very short time he's been in office, this one is particularly galling for many people, not least because it seems transparently related to the Brexit decision and the UK's subsequent isolation without any apparent plan. They had no problem giving Xi Jiping a state visit in 2016. People expect terrible things from the Saudi's and other dictators, but they hold the US to a much higher standard for human rights (rightly or wrongly). The US has always presented itself as a model for how a country should be run by its people. When the US appears to go off the rails, people sit up and take notice. They protest *because* the US has led the way before and they fear that now it will lead everyone over a cliff.   Lots of people hate our relationship with those places as well.  No. It's symbolic.  It's like having a tax collector come to your house. You might invite them in and ask them to sit, maybe even make them a coffee. But you wouldn't throw them a party, shower them with praise and invite them to stay in your guest bedroom. Who says they aren't?  Those who knew about it were. Unlike Trumps' potential visit, the mainstream media didn't really put it about that our government was selling weapons to arseholes. Or, if they did (because I can't exactly remember and therefore I might be wrong about how widespread the information regarding the aforementioned weapon sales was), I'd imagine the tone of the language used during the narrative wasn't one of condemnation.  It's almost like the media had an agenda to push... but that can't be right, surely? You mean to tell me that Rupert Murdoch, a man who has friends in very high places, would willingly put a spin on any news that could otherwise cause trouble for his pals? Never!  But overall, you're right; more people should've said something about the weapon sales. I'm disappointed that so many remained quiet. ""The x-ray machine isn't working either, so you'll have to lie on this mattress here while these slags take a piss on you."" lol hardman. You honestly think refusing Trump a state visit would mean the UK suddenly ceases to exist? Im not sure why I need to point this out, but:  How about being equals? No one first, but jointly agreeing things with some sacrifice, compromise and advantages for both sides? clinton did win the popular vote in both primary and general election. though bernie was screwed out of any support from the dem establishment and probably would have won given a fair shake and no superdelegates . democrat turn out was monumentally low last year and interference from russia and the fbi were absolute tragedies and clinton still won the general elections popular vote so bernie probably would have won by a landslide.  just wanted to clear up some things Indeed state visits are controlled by Parliament. The Queen is literally just a tourist attraction these days.  The full details haven't been released yet (I imagine the PDF will be released in the next couple of days), but the standard for UK polls is between 1500 and 2000. Ahh ok oops. On top of that, Obama didn't get a state visit until years into his term. Trump is not even a month in. Okay then...  1) it's not a vote but a petition.   2) you're right  babies probably didn't sign the petition so knock off ~11,000,000 which would make  it ~3.3% still under a 1% difference  3) [I just did signed the petition and I am not british, I have never lived there and only visited for the olympics](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/171928/signatures/new)  So yes you're right, I was wrong. Though I would like to point out this petition isn't the same as a vote. So no age restriction. No restriction of double dipping (yes I signed it twice). Also no captcha or attempt at it, so bots. So the 1.8 million signatures could all be British citizens or they could be the US citizens, or anyone with an internet connection....  https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/171928/signatures/new *may have What is an 'of vote'? Curious. I'm sure I'm gonna get hate for this, but isn't this kind of thinking how we got in this mess in the first place? We've gotten so caught up in gestures and theater that our government has ceased to get any real work done. Think of how much human effort has now been spent on preventing Donald Trump from meeting the Queen. The Queen is a figurehead, aside from the theatrics of it, meeting her is inconsequential, but here we are devoting resources to that goal rather than affecting something more tangible.  Tldr: Who cares?  Just let the Queen decide if she wants to meet him.  Trump can't meet the Queen but they rolled the red carpet for the leader of a communist dictatorship last year. Great consistency! Makes sense, I guess. Thanks! you are right. You know, with this argument it all seems much more reasonable. Well, now he's coming for sure. ""The X-Ray thing-a-mi-bob's bein' a right bloody dodgy wanker!"" good job peddling fake news that was published by BUZZFEED!! :]   The guy I was replying to said they would detain the President... >Im not sure why I need to point this out  You don't have to. I'm just complaining on the phrasing. It can be turned around really easily.   Though...  >How about being equals? No one first, but jointly agreeing things with some sacrifice, compromise and advantages for both sides?  I think you have too much faith in humanity. I doubt anybody, even the EU, actually cares. Exactly correct my friend, it would have been a *Motherfucking Avalanche*. So sadly ironic that Hillary spent so much time as a senator working to abolish the electoral college too, its like she was psychic. One is simple piece of data, the other drinks Tea and disagrees with you. At the last big petition (2nd Referendum petition), the UK government deleted a large number (something like ~~50K~~ 77K [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/26/concern-as-online-call-for-second-brexit-vote-gains-more-than-39/] if my memory serves me right) of the signatures for not being from the UK and other technical reasons. So if this was a genuine problem I'm sure they'd be barking it louder than a pack of wolves. I'd estimate around 5-10%, not that it really matters anyway, since these petitions are more a less pointless.  Regarding the bots, that's probably difficult to implement without detection. >  **I just did signed the petition and I am not british**, I have never lived there and only visited for the olympics  Then it won't register even if you've signed it, your signature will be listed under your voting constituency. You can click on the map to see how many people in your constituency have signed the petition. Probably so his replacement becomes more likely  Queen doesn't make those decisions at all. Her Government does. (   ) I think in Britain they call the X-ray a Whizzbozzle Flanhammer Nice username It's legit, nice try Russian scum So? Sure it would be a diplomatic fuckstorm but hardly a ""Lets wipe out the U.K"".  Please dont depress me further.  I find it hard to engage in any amount of 'world news' or political debate at the moment. she is a very good politician and has had an immaculate career, but she was the dem shoe-in for president for so long the republican party  got plenty of time to wage their smear campaign which soured public opinion of her so much. plus she's a women which is a damn shame that that even matters still, but there are still alot of sexist assholes in this country. the writing was kind of on the wall for clinton, she's just been in the spotlight too long and the dem party should have noticed and found someone new in the public eye and charismatic, it worked for obama. Isn't the threshold is 1 million? There's almost double that amount so some wrong petitioners won't bring it under the threshold   Correct. (Live in UK) What? Couldn't she strait up refuse to? What would they do if she refused?  thanks, I use it to call our retards who propagate BS Sorry dude. You can say I'm kinda of a misanthrope, so at this point the shitstorm around Trump is just funny for me.   Have an upvote, and cheers! c[_] The threshold is 100,000 for a debate, not 1,000,000. If it were a million probably almost none would go up for debate.  100k. She can,but she never did. And she also met with straight up dictators before, so she can eat trump for breakfast. The Queen can do a lot of things she doesn't, because if she did there wouldn't be a monarchy anymore.  The Queen could also legitimately refuse to not make a law, a law. As she is the final person who literally puts a stamp of approval on it.  It is also the fastest way to totally remove the Monarchy from any degree of government and most people agree to do so would be removing the Monarchy altogether, making the UK a Republic.  TLDR:  She doesn't refuse shit, unless she's sick. Or if she does, there is some serious discussions gonna happen in the background. Nor does she do anything including shitting without prior consultation of the Prime Minister at the very least. She would get chucked into the Straits of Gibraltar. *straight  My favourite story is her driving the Saudi King around and him being really uncomfortable. Sounds like a win-win then.

"9",8,"5r8mbd","2017-01-31","webside is down TIL there are days when French unions aren't on strike. Do they still service Flights to Israel?  How about to Flights to countries belonging to the Arab League?    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League_boycott_of_Israel  Just sayin'....  How is it ok to protest US restrictions in this manner, when the same thing happens elsewhere?  Israelis ban Arabs, and Arabs ban Israelis in the exact same manner.  Where's the outrage for that?   I guess if you've been doing it longer, makes it less outrageous.   A French Union urging workers to refuse to work? Definitely the first time I'm hearing that!  [removed] Fuck this website that keeps redirecting so I can't fucking read it myself.  > The hardline CGT trade union at Air France has called on its members to refuse to work [...]    Our good old CGT ... I don't get it.  What are they hoping to accomplish here? As nice as this is of them, Trump's supporters will see opposition by French union members as a positive. The whole idea of ""French worker unions"" is to find excuses to do less work ;) Hmm....I wonder will my US-Europe flight with Air France this summer be disrupted? Air France is the company that makes female staff wear Hijabs when flying to Iran:  https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2016/04/183734/air-france-requires-female-staff-crew-to-wear-hijab-on-iran-flights/ I am glad that corporations are taking a stand against Trump, unlike the rest of the Trump supporters in this thread. When are people going to come to terms with the fact Muslims aren't a race. It's a group of people who supposedly follow a philosophy. One which has an estimated 10-15 % radicalized following. That's 150-300 million Muslims they want an end to Western culture and all we love and hold dear.  Fuck Islam.  The level of sheer ignorance concerning the history of workers struggles over the past two hundred years is astounding. No wonder Trump won. So... Is it not super weird that all these foreign countries have opinions on U.S. Policies?  Don't most of these countries that are bitching have more strict rules about immigration than the U.S.?  And further more.. What business of theirs is it what our policies are?   Just asking. Not trying to start shit lol. I'm honestly curious.  Yes, because France doesn't have a huge immigration problem  Let them do the flights to Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Iran, Libya, Somalia and Sudan then. There's plenty of people that would much rather work on flights to LA, NEW YORK, SAN FRANCISCO, SEATTLE etc. Lots of EU airlines are having to reschedule their staff planning, since the staff is not allowed to enter US.   At this point it's merely an inconvenience, but if this stupidity keeps up, guess who the airlines will not be looking to hire in the future.   It should be a concern to any airline union. [removed] Well, thats stupid. Warning: Abort thread. ""We are tolerant, we care about all people will always stand up for what is right""  ""We don't like your president who barely won the election, so fuck all of you"" Does anybody have a feeling that this is merely political posturing? I'll never understand how inconveniencing random people is an effective protest against Trump's policies.  Oh god I can see the return of freedom fries coming from the alt-nazis. The Frenchies looking for any excuse to stop working? Color me shocked.. I really doubt he's going to care until people start boycotting his businesses. ""Air France union urges members to refuse work"" - there, fixed this for you. Obama did the same thing when he halted the Iraqi refugee program for six months due to security concerns, yet there was ZERO mention of it in the media then. Hmm, strange, it's almost as if our mainstream media is fake news. Ah yes, do they all they can for the tanking tourist business.  http://www.sigmalive.com/en/news/international/148067/tourism-to-paris-sees-a-sharp-decline If only there were more airlines that did this, just imagine if no airlines flew to America. Try checking out the webback. http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN15F1OF You actually read the article? Wtf? /s Website refused to work already.  i can read it juat fine I know it's a joke, but working conditions have improved in France in great part thanks to trade unions. Yes, there are excesses, but our country is better off thanks to unions. It's good to enjoy 5 paid weeks off work, some sort of protection from getting fired for no reason while not crippling the economy. Yes. Days since strike: 2  They were looking for excuse. Same for Lufthansa pilots.   Six figure wages, demand more payment. Strike incoming.  Actually most day in the year. As a french, maybe a reason is that we all know Arab country and Israel are very controversial country with a lot of moral faults, but Trump USA is something we will have to adapt.  For us growing up America stand, for the better or worst, as the policeman of the planet who we also share some of our values (most of it). Imagine seeing that big brother figure now turning more and more into fascism everyday.. You'd want to voice your concerns as an ally. This is an argument we see a lot and I find it problematic.  I'm not from the US (from the UK actually) and throughout my life I've heard that the US is the land of the free, where all men are equal and all that jazz. Why are we trying to compare such prestige with backwards Arabic nations of Israel which according to the UN has committed major international crimes.  I would have assumed that the great USA would hold itself to higher standards. Well first. The arab unions don't portray themselves as a bastion of  freedoom and democracy. And don't have a track record of give me your poor and huddled masses.  The US does. Im not expecting the  AU or China to change it's stripes  straight away. But i do expect better from america who ""claims"" it's for freedom  But ur point is still valid there is a lot of  BS  point scoring against causes going on. Black lives matter  get all fucking pissy if a black man is kept down by the white police. White police start hating on the brown man,Where is the outrage from BLM now. hypocritical cunts  Uh, Israel doesn't ban Arabs. It's a one way street. Not saying they are perfect in this conflict, but they don't ban Arabs from coming to their country. 14 Arab countries do ban Israelis, though. Hey keep in mind that it's just a few people asking for that, you can check the % on unionized workers in Air France.  In my opinion it's about protesting the country regressing. Yes there are places that have similar policies but banning travel there will aggregate relationships with those countries. On the other hand when a country is immediately slapped for doing something bad they are more likely to revert their decision. Because publicly criticizing the US makes you cool. Also it makes you feel good for eating McDonald's, wearing American brands and watching American movies and TV shows. Higher expectations for America The idea -was- that the USA was better than those shitty countries. Hence people care about the US more than Saudi Arabia. Treating them as equivalents would be even worse.  I see. So if you can't be perfect, might as well throw any ethical considerations out the window. ""B-b-but they do it *tooo*...""  Get used to the fact that the rest of the world isn't brainwashed and wildly polarized on every issue like americans are. The two situations are absolutely not at all similar. The Arab League has denounced Israel since it's creation after world War II. Israel has always been extremely controversial, even more so in the Arab world. Trying to compare our current situation to that situation is either extremely ignorant or plain stupid.  The United States should be held to a higher standard. We have spent centuries as the beacon of inclusiveness and freedom for immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees alike. Almost everyone in the U.S. is an immigrant. Comparing us to other countries just shouldn't apply. > Where's the outrage for that?   France has a large Arab population, you face reverse pressure when you have such a large minority. The union does not choose flight routes and the say the exact same thing there as they do here... you can refuse to travel to Iran the same as the US.  Which is why French people have affordable healthcare and education.  That's also why German workers have it. Unlike the main clich that gullible people are more than happy to swallow, French workers actually work more than German workers and are also more productive. [Such injustice](http://m.imgur.com/eN7o70z?r). Keep shitting on the French when the continue to exceed the US on social issues, workers rights, human rights, etc.  Lol French workers organize and advocate for their interests, the losers.  Yea, the airline industry in France has not had a work stoppage since, what, last September? A union doing union stuff? I can't tell if you're being brainwashed by populism, pushing an agenda or simply if you're just misinformed, but terrorist attacks in France were almost all done by young adults born and educated in France. Its almost as if their principles extend farther than trumps micropenis It's almost as if they aren't the stereotyped scared surrender monkeys that right wing derptards made them out to be. >No, they force their female attendants to wear hijabs instead.  You're falsely equating the company to the union. They gave them the option to wear hijabs or not work on those flights do you compare america to iran? i never thought i will see the day lol Sooo... the US is now equal to Iran now... great. That's where I want the country headed - to a religious theocracy where religious ideas dictate life in America. I mean... both are wrong. What's your point? That because we never shamed them for tolerating discrimination against Israelis, it's okay now to discriminate against Muslims?  We should have shamed them for tolerating discrimination against Israelis.  I love how in almost every thread about the US, there are now people saying ""but whatabout muh Iran!!!""  Isn't that what Americans hated when people talked about Russia? ""Why do you bring America into a thread that's about Russia""? Well, why do you bring Iran into a thread about America? Whataboutism at it's best. Wrong circlejerk... Two wrongs don't make a right. Bringing attention to the hypocrisy is commendable but at the same time everyone that is handwaving the actions away like this is giving the message that nothing should be done about it because nothing has been done about a similar situation before.  They can be wrong in one situation and still be right in the other, criticize them when appropriate and congratulate them when appropriate. Don't just criticize them when they should be congratulated. Well, airline staff have to follow the local laws while in the country, even if those laws are shitty and sexist (such as a hijab and loose-fitting clothing mandate).  They also can't have gay sex while on an Iranian tarmac, since Iran is homophobic and bans gay sex.  Also as someone else said, this is the union, it was the company that tried to make it's female employees wear hijabs. The union complained and I think the compromise was that the airline would allow female employees to choose not to fly the Tehran route. Iran doesn't recognize Israel as a state. Does the US allow flights from Abkhazia or South Ossetia? Of course not.  You are comparing apples to oranges.  Also, any day where you have to look to Iran to justify your warped views is a really fucking sad day for America. We should be held to a much higher standard than either Israel or Iran. America is seen as the free world though, iran not. Whew almost forgot to read my whataboutism/deflection post of the day, but here it is!!!! >Do they urge their members not to work on Iran flights for banning visas from Israel?  Ok, I'm sick of this shit. Especially from people like /u/Hazz91 who bring up shit that has nothing to do with the situation. This is probably the fifth time I've had to explain this; so I do it slowly for you. It's. Not. The. Same. Fucking. Thing.   People come to America for a better life, to better themselves. People from Israel have no fucking reason to go to Iran! Please tell me why anyone would want to go to a country they'd probably be killed in? It doesn't matter, because they aren't going anyway. I seriously don't understand why Trump supporters this is media conspiracy, it's not. Because it's not even close to being relevant! Well I forget who I'm talking to.  I'm in shock how people think this is even worthy of bringing up.    ""Whataboutism"" [Yes](http://www.leparisien.fr/laparisienne/societe/paris-teheran-le-voile-de-la-discorde-sur-la-future-ligne-air-france-02-04-2016-5681193.php) We expect less from Iran...  If we start treating the US like the way we do other backwards countries, shit is going to get really funny real quick. obviously France can do what they want.. why should it give so much fucks about Israel? considering the % of muslim in france, they have no choice but to bend over otherwise they lose all of their muslim customer that go in north africa by plane :> Europeans being hypocrites?  No fucking way! Finally someone in this thread that understands Nothing. This union urges their workers to strike every single day. This was just another excuse to use. I can't believe it's actually news, all the media is doing is pushing the union's agenda by covering it I would guess not since the ban will probably expire before then. And we're not talking about air france...   We're talking about their flight attendants' union, two completely different things.  Why you always have a moron to say stupid stuff to cast some critic over the main protagonist? Air France female staff are not assigned against their will on destination enforcing hijab.  [source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/04/air-france-allows-female-cabin-crew-to-opt-out-of-iran-route-in-headscarf-row) Everyone here would appreciate it if you did some research before talking total bullshit. Air France never ""made"" the females wear hijabs. A decision the union was opposed to and made strikes against. They even managed to get some compromises. They also accept to fly to the US dicatorship.  Which is why the union is fighting Air France on those two fronts. I may be wrong here, but isn't that more of a respect issue more than anything? Air France is not making them, Iran is making them. It's a law there, if you want to fly there, you have to wear the veil (not the Hijab).  The Union tried to fight against it, but Air France wanted to fly there. Same thing will happen with the U.S., even though it's less and less a free country. This is not a corporation taking a stand, but a union. Corporations have just discovered that they can get tons of points by doing next to nothing and talking big.  It's REALLY funny to me that the same people that bitch uo and down about corporations being involved in politics are so excited about this kind of stuff. The minute that they think they can get more brownie points and follows by doing the opposite, they will.   I really, really, really dislike the precedent being set. Yes because we want spend tons of resources on camps rather than use them for homeless veterans or orphans or the tons of infrastructure issues we already have. Can you even imagine the shit storm and excuse for stupid laws if [this happened](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1315538/huge-mob-of-300-migrants-storm-port-in-calais-in-violent-bid-to-smuggle-their-way-into-uk/amp/?client=safari) in America?   I'm all for helping refugees by rebuilding schools, hospitals, and homes in their homeland. But having thousands or millions flood the US is not the answer. We have our own problems that needs to be dealt with. I'm taking a stand against trump, he is leaving the protection for LGBT federal employees in place, this doesn't fit the narrative of him being literally Hitler, we need to get him to reverse this so we can protest against it . Your candidate lost get over it  It's a union taking a convenient stand...  They say how much money ACLU got and now they want theirs hahaha  Less tourists already visiting France due to extended state of emergency on a constant basis. If it gets out of hand and less profit then some of the staff might get laid off and then even more unrest and unemployment.   There are still Trump supporters? Because believe it or not, but big multinational corporations benefit from left-wing globalist policies.  New Trumpian Republican policy stands up to the multinationals looking to suppress wages through permissive immigration policies and exploiting the third world through free trade deals. Immigration and refugee laws of one country impact other countries by adversely sending those that would relocate one place to another. Immigration is important in regulating birth/death rates, age demographic, infrastructure etc of a country. National Assemblies will often manipulate the flow of these immigrants and refugees in order to best fill gaps in things like population density and unbalanced age demographic.   It's good for countries to keep an eye on other countries immigration and refuge laws to better anticipate the flow of peoples. Also, it helps us better understand how immigrants/refugees can help our economy rather than hurt it.  This is a very baseline reason I could think of. There's loads of other sociopolitical forces driving those actions. No. That is not super weird.  No other modern country cancels visa in bulk after they've been issued. Nor do they leave their legal permanent residents stranded abroad. Nor do they prohibit passengers from transiting through their country to other countries, because of their country of birth.  This move by the US is unprecedented and absurd. visas aren't the same as immigration so it's not just immigration i'm pretty sur the US has one of the most strict immigration rule or at least compare to EU. Indeed, we don't have a huge immigration problem. Horrible service, even in premium cabins.     How many hours a week an employee works matters but what matters as much is how efficient and/or productive this employee is.  French workers happen to be extremely productive.  This is a fact. But hey, what's a fact compared to your gut feeling? https://mic.com/articles/91527/the-most-productive-country-in-the-world-isn-t-the-one-you-would-expect#.IhDYUI2tE What makes you think he even has businesses? Just the fact he says so probably means they're all bankrupt. Almost seems like that would be what trump wants. I'd like to see a ban on all travel to/from the USA until the USA stops fingerprinting tourists like criminals, and until they stop caring what other citizenships somebody might have - the only citizenship that is important is the one on the passport used for travel. Law-abiding American residents were detained and some were deported just because of where they were from. Please explain to me how that's ""the same thing"" as suspending the issuance of new refugee visas. Obama never did the same thing.....he banned travel from Iraq, for a short time.....Trump did that for 7 countries. Trying to tell some ''alternative facts'' here or something?  Still the most visited country on earth. By far.   You'll have better luck with the webfront. [removed] I think we need to call a session of the House Un-reddit Activities Committee ""If you want something said about workers right, ask a socialist; if you want something done about it, ask a union. "" Switzerland did the same without the strikes.  Different country different reasons. But just saying these workers rights can be accomplished without some of the messes that strikes create >  while not crippling the economy   Except for this part ;) You may get a lot of holidays in France, but the employers make up for it in the amount of stress they put on their employees. That is assuming you can actually find a job. Employers are afraid to higher any permanent workers since it's so hard to fire people resulting in only 6 month contracts (CDD) for a majority of workers.  > Yes. Days since strike: 2  Saturdays and Sundays don't count. As an American I just want to say thank you. We talk a lot of smack about you but it's all in brotherly love. So basically like watching your protective big brother slowly getting hooked on heroine and becoming louder, more violent and irrational and then saying your pocket money is his pocket money because he's your brother? US aren't ""policeman of the planet"", it's just something invented to justify all those conflcits. US is on the world stage one of the bigger aggressors, financing and participating in terrorism, wars, blackmail, etc. What US defends is their interests. If that interest is in conflict with another country, then they'll go against that country, even if it's unjust. Like they did with Iran in 1953, or with Nicaragua in the 80s or the Iraq war where they lied to the world to justify it.  The thing about the US is that they're our close ally and our interests are closely tied together. This ally suddenly becoming unstable and getting a lot of criticism from the public is creating a complicated situation. Israel and those  Arab countries aren't seen as close allies, maybe as lose ones or more in a neutral position. A ban against a country based on their actions in a conflict is relatively acceptable.   A ban against many countries due to prejudice and racism is another matter entirely.   After USA's actions, Iran responded with a ban on their own. They didn't ban christian or caucasian people, they banned Americans. That's the difference between political diplomacy and racism.   Israel and Palestine have in a racist conflict for over half a decade, Israel is the occupying force in control and is methodically taking over the region whilst they deny Palestine, and therefore Palestinian rights, exist. Most of the world has condemned Israel's ongoing actions, it's no surprise that other Arabic countries would protest Israel.   Haven't yall hated us for like..... well longer than ive been alive? so more then 30 years? did you protest when obama did the same thing trump is doing now? Oh in English we call that a hypocrite.  De nada  How loudly did you voice your concerns to Israel or the Arab countries?  ....so quietly, nobody heard. Immigration is a privilege, not a right. Like any other country, the US is allowed to ban immigration from whatever country it wishes for whatever reason.   In this case, it's simply to improve existing vetting procedures from the previous administration. Something James Comey, the FBI director, has said needs to be improved upon as well.   Although I do agree the execution was done poorly.  > throughout my life I've heard that the US is the land of the free, where all men are equal and all that jazz  I mean, c'mon. Once you learn a bit about American history or politics it becomes quite clear this is clever propaganda. >The passports of some countries are not valid for travel to Israel. These countries include Bangladesh, Brunei, Iran, Iraq, and Pakistan.  Did I say they ban all Arabs?  No.   Well, the sad thing is...  The more people protest, the more resolve Trump will have in keeping the policy in place.  Protest enough, and he'll just keep extending the ban.  Politically correct isn't something you're going to get out of somebody that enjoys the waves he makes. ""Any ethical"" isn't what we are talking about.  ""Singular ethical"", is more like it.  It doesn't matter what's going on, as long as it's somebody you're emboldened to complain about that's getting the unfair amount of criticism.  As long as you don't have to look anywhere you're not comfortable, right? Well, there are similarities.  While I agree there's a lot of different considerations, it doesn't change the fact that they are limiting travel explicitly in relation to origin.  The Arab League, largely refuses to acknowledge the Israelis officially negating their passports, but you can bet certain members in that League do so for fear of access from what they perceive as a threat.  Exactly the same reasons for the Israeli's limiting travel from certain Arab locations.  So go ahead, and explain your position...  I'd love to hear it.   >centuries  you mean like.. both? > The United States should be held to a higher standard.  but like.... why?  >We have spent centuries as the beacon of inclusiveness and freedom for immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees alike.  No you haven't. Immigration in America has been a contentious issue since inception. Don't be a historical revisionist and claim America has always been like it is now.  Comparing the US to other countries should apply.  Because the fact exists, that the global community is howling over what they have already accepted and it is ridiculous.  A double standard exits.   > The United States should be held to a higher standard  bullshit.  walmart lets any trash through their doors, they are the beacon of inclusiveness.  walmart is not the standard for high quality  just because you let people in doesn't make you any better than anyone else.  this is not an indicator of quality **at all** >centuries  Just say entire existence. Centuries implies the US has been around for hundreds of years. We are a relatively new country/phenomenon to world history.  Oh no... it's retarded... What about the standards for Muslim countries? Where are they? Should we just you know hold them to Stop Killing Gays or Stoning women? I guess standing up for what you believe in only happens if it's easy...   But I don't see the headlines saying the union is encouraging it, now do I? Gosh it's almost like unions provide a valuable mechanic in the economic and workplace environments and Americans have been conditioned to think otherwise by decades of propaganda.  But that can't be right. I know ***I'd*** never be fooled. A few points:  1.) it is very difficult to get fired in france 2.) if you are fired, severance can be a nice package 3.) in my ex company, days were worked in half hour increments when billed to tasks. A full ""day"" could consist of working on 2 tasks, and could be reported as 8 hours while only being 2-4 hours of actual work. Many employees ""hid"" their time with this.   Source: french company got into a bit of a billing dispute with a US client and I worked for the french company.   Is it anecdotal? Sure.  Do french people and german people work hard? Sure.   But funnily enough, Americans work on average more hours per year than either country (at least for 2015 don't known2016 numbers) Factcheck please. The working week of most France is 35 hrs weeks but mostly all jobs have 38+ hrs contracts resulting in many free days on top of comparable holidays count between GER / FRA. Working for one of the largest French groups there is as a German - would love to see some prove (or even hint) on the productivity bit.   The point one healthcare/education overall has the right direction. [removed] We have healthcare because of millions of workers in the private sector and their employers pay the world biggest labor taxes (plus debt, we have huge social debt). Our unions represent 8% of the working population, mostly in the public sector.  Why is it that the German GDP/capita is higher than that of France? > French workers actually work more than German workers and are also more productive.  *Faints* And also high youth unemployment rate: http://www.tradingeconomics.com/france/youth-unemployment-rate I thought it was American arms subsidies that provided the developed world with affordable healthcare and education. France has a lower rate of union membership than the U.S, it's among the least unionised OECD countries.  In the neighboring thread i was told that Iran is much much better, actually. Well as an outsider watching the inauguration, with the number of preachers giving benedictions, it could as well have been said in Farsi. Both are nation states... it's an analogy, not an equality. whatever suits your narrative i guess Iran does not recognize Israel tho.

About the hijab, I don't find it anything that problematic. It's a custom, it's a law, female attendants can choose to not serve the route. No, hypocrisy.  appeal to hypocrisy Oh look, the new ""strawman"" that the pseudointellectual kiddies on reddit have latched on to and will ""see"" everywhere.  Great :/ I think the point he's making is less ""we should let this discrimination continue because we let them discriminate before"" and more ""wow, these people let discrimination happen before, why are they speaking out now if they were okay with it earlier?""  I get the suspicion that a big part of the issue is that the US is doing this rather than some small backwater country that isn't our problem and easier to hand wave.   Regardless, neither is really recommended. Thanks, Nana.  But 3 do ;P  Do you know how many persian jews there are living in Israel? like 250k.  Maybe just maybe they want to go back home....maybe  Its nice that you have a little set of rules for the people of Israel to follow. ""israeli have no reason to go to iran because they probably be killed  there""     And you want to welcome people from this country to america.   I'm sure we can give higher priority to  other countries.        yes, we know. it is a real thing. get over it Since when is Europeans being hypocritical a stereotype? Sounds communist /s The disrupt the plans of customers who rely on a service, obviously. Trumpets/alt-rights have been extremely active on /r/worldnews since Trump was inaugurated - they feel empowered by their moronic cult leader. They just jump onto any new threads, post any random facts that fits their narrative**, upvote each other and then rush to the next thread.  /r/worldnews has become an actual cesspool. At this point I'd rather go back to the times where threads were full of stupid puns - at least it was harmless.  ** in this case some article from when the news first came out and before any decision was taken by AirFrance. In fact female cabin attendants can refuse to wear a hijab and simply not be on flights to Iran without consequences.  (yup, I'm using a throwaway. Can't be too careful with the psychos from t_d...) How is that a respect thing?  Would you be ok with women having to wear miniskirts because certain countries like it? It is.  It's respecting a culture that treats women as property so dumb that it requires telling what to wear by men.     I don't respect it at all.   No women have to wear a Hijab when in Iran by law. Including airspace apparently! Maybe we should ask them to suck on their toes as a sign of respect too. Which, just as any french union, are just gonna take any stand possible to have something to fight over. Source: french. its usual reddit for you going 180 on everything just because they dislike the president is something usual  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing  Precedent was set a long time ago. It can't possibly be because they and the corporations agree this green card ban is fucked up? > I really, really, really dislike the precedent being set.  Some of us hate the *sitting president* even more than we hate money in politics. The flight attendants are not refugees. They're citizens of an arguably better country than the US. With jobs, and families, and safe living conditions.  This has nothing to do with refugees. ""Trump isn't overturning slavery so why aren't the lefties against that too?"" WTF I hate gay rights now You're just salty because you didn't want your candidate to face any criticism after the election was over.  It's gonna be a long four years buddy, get over it. [removed] You are the problem. Continuing to blame people's disagreement with their president because ""there candidate lost"" is just you refusing to move on and look at issues separately from party politics. Get real and actually attempt to contribute something to the conversation than pulling the old worn out ""you lost"" card. Seriously and the fact that Donald won't get over the election and stop referring back to the fact he won at every chance he gets is really off putting. He's going to ride that high all the way out and make a ton of enemies in the process all in the name of pride and ego. Classic Narcissistic behavior. Narcissist surrounded by yes men, it's disaster waiting to happen.  Unsourced claims that Trump is sticking it to big-business when all evidence points to the contrary?  I'm gonna have to go with 'not' TIL the Republican Party is a left-wing political group. Why use real facts when we got alternative facts on deck oh no he couldn't travel to his golf courses and other properties.  No more lavish vacations wherever human trash like himself vacation. His tiny hands, non exsistant brain and giant ego couldn't handle being excluded or banned. Japan fingerprints tourists too.  I don't see this as a bad thing. yes he did the 7 countries are those, obama chose So Obama did the same thing, the only difference is that the number of countries has increased because ISIS is more widespread now and has a much greater influence.  It was actually the Obama administration which designated these seven countries as being dangerously compromised by terrorism groups in the first place. So if it offends you you should blame them. Or if you think it's wrong and these countries are safe then why don't you go there on vacation? Woah a Mexican wall joke that's pun in a thread about websitesin a post about Trump's immigration order. 3meta5me. France is fine. I'd be more worried if i were American. Aren't work weeks shorter too? I'd take the stress you mentioned for a large % of my life back. LOl Reddit does not like their world view shattered. I can concur with this assessment. I was living there for a while in the last two years and many of my friends there had great difficulty finding jobs. We are talking about people with college degrees. Yes it can be hard for people with certain degrees to get jobs here in the US but even basic jobs like receptionist were difficult to obtain over there.  Yes, and they're all surrender monkeys too, right? And notice how they all wear berets? And how they all constantly smell of stinky cheeses?  HAHA! YOUR CULTURAL INSIGHTS ARE SO DELIGHTFUL!    ^^^/s Oh look, the sun came out. Days since strike: 0 Same here. I always find it funny how the number one thing Americans dislike about French is how arrogant they are and the number one thing French dislike about Americans is also how arrogant they are. As if we weren't that different. I Hope we won't have the same clown show during our election as you did though. But so far it looks like I'm way too hopeful. I think it also is a compliment that the world expects more from America than some small middle eastern nation.  As an American I try to defend the French from other Americans baseless attacks :)  France, unlike most other ally of US, choose to keep it's own army and do not rely on US money for it's protection, but the other part of the analogy, yes You realize that those Arab countries have hated Israel since their inception, right? Stop spreading bullshit lies. You shut your damn mouth, France has been our oldest friend. They were there for us when no one else was \#LafayetteBro Hm not sure why you would think that, outside of europe you're our biggest ally. We had our period of critics (iraq war for instance), but it never was hate. It's easy to buy into that lazy thinking, but please don't. Not at all. Like France the US can be a bit arrogant and full of itself, but we love you guys. I honestly think the issue between the US and France is that we're a lot alike, and nothing strips down a person  faster than their own reflection.  Also I think it should be noted that France is major part of why we even have a country. Marquis de La Fayette is one of our Founding Fathers. But he didn't. Stop spreading this lie.  Obama banned Iraqi refugees (not even existing visa holders) for 6 months IN RESPONSE to Iraqi refugees in the US being implicated in a terror plot.  He then said that the citizens from  38-40 countries that do not require a visa to travel to America would not be exempt IF they had travelled to the now 7 banned countries. That is, these citizens would need to apply for a visa and...go through a vetting process.   No we don't. A hypocrite would decry something while also actively engaged in it. De rien*  French, not Spanish. I'd expect even your little brain to understand the difference.  A redneck American pretending to have a good grasp of English... You may not have heard-maybe cause it does not concern you directly- but the subject does not go unnoticed in France at all. There was too much money stuffed in their mouths to bring much volume. Arab countries seem to have that effect.  Edit: Sorry [downvoters](https://youtu.be/VbxQGUBGcQ4), it's just me I guess. Sure, they're free to do what they want and everyone else is free to complain about it. What better way to protest then not provide a service for said country? I see what you did here. What's the other option, besides not protesting? I don't think they ban Israelis by fear, but only because to these countries, Israel is not something legitimate. Just like if someone decided to create his own country in his backyard and tried to enter another one with his own passport.  He's not a revisionist, he's been eating and breathing propaganda his whole life. By definition the united States *has* been around for hundreds of years. More than two hundreds in fact. Yeah the well-adjusted doctors and engineers I work with who work and study here are totally stoning women all the time.   Start with one issue and move from there. In time they will be held to a higher standard but I do belive it is bordering on impossible to fix everything at once. With that said when you fix one problem your standards shuld be held a bit higher and one shuld not add more problems at that point unless one wants to gain backlash in doing so. The issues you posted are alredy condemned by western countries. You're literally in a thread with that headline...   And I don't control what you do and don't see, that's all on you.  I don't see Trump supporter's disapproval of the ban, now do I? No way Germans would be so good at making high quality cars, electronics and appliances [if their workers be unionized, right?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IG_Metall) Of course the US population are brainwashed against unions.  They fear its one step away from communism, when in fact its protectionism against corporate or governmental greed.  Ironically, if they'd had more unionism in the US, half the reasons why particular people (ie Rust belt etc) voted in Trump would've been irrelevent - they would've been able to support themselves. Unions can be very useful. There are plenty of good ones in the US. There are also a lot of corrupt and greedy ones that have forced companies out of business. It's the latter that gets the publicity.  All they provide is a reason for high youth unemployment.  Go easy on that rhetoric. Abusive unions had a huge hand on the dismantling of American manufacturing.  Is working more hours better though?  > 1.) it is very difficult to get fired in france  True, but your immediate boss will make your life a living hell if you refuse to quit on your own accord. And that's why we have higher incomes! That we can go ahead and spend on useless shit that we don't have any time to enjoy. Woo for us! That's not what I experienced in the US... A 40 hour work week INCLUDED lunch break, walking around the lake near the office with colleagues, etc..  http://www.bbc.com/news/34667552  35 hrs is for some employees, not all. Many workers in the private sector and independent workers can work more and do. http://stats.oecd.org/  OECD measures productivity by GDP per hour worked. In that measure, he is correct. The top 10 countries by productivity in 2015 are:  1. Luxembourg 2. Norway 3. Ireland 4. Belgium 5. Denmark 6. United States 7. Netherlands 8. France 9. Germany 10. Switzerland France spends only *slightly* more in public (""taxpayer"") funds on healthcare than the US. The US spends about as much public money on healthcare as the UK does.  For that money, they UK has an NHS that covers everyone, with private still being an option for the wealthy. That same amount of money, spent in the US buys them a clusterfuck where people risk going bankrupt if they get sick, even with obscenely expensive (privately paid) insurance.  [graph](http://www.oecd.org/media/oecdorg/satellitesites/newsroom/48294761hd2011fr.png) [source](http://www.oecd.org/newsroom/healthspendingcontinuestooutpaceeconomicgrowthinmostoecdcountries.htm) Not quite. Government employees contribute too. A tad less but they still do.  https://emploi-public.publidia.fr/remuneration-fonctionnaires/cotisations-salariales-fonctionnaires [It's not](http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=PDB_LV) When you regain consciousness, you should look it up. So in other words, because the US is spending so much in the military and ""protects the developed world"", the rest of the Western world can spend the money instead on healthcare?   It sounds very good, but is a complete fantasy. The US is spending 2 to 3 times what other European countries are spending on healthcare.   So you thought wrong.  France has much heavier labor laws and workers are more protected, by law, than in many other countries. There is therefore less of a need to be unionized in France than elsewhere. The union complained and now female staff members are allowed to choose not to fly the Tehran route.  Obviously it would be best if Iran relaxed it's sexist laws, but at least this compromise is something. The union didn't accept it, they did exactly the same thing there as they're doing here. They told their female flight attendants they could refuse to fly there.    you were corrected.. fix your false comment and stop spreading misinformation.  [removed] Can I see your source? Nah, they're doing this because they expect more of the US. The Middle East has been a diplomatical cluster fuck for ages.  No, they are doing it because America is supposed to stand for greater standards than this, not be compared to the worst of the worst. You're opinion is misinformed, the union did strikes against these as well and manage to get a compromise.  But they also have to coose their fights and they can't really expect Iran to chance their sexist laws. They make a strike when it has at least a chance to start a negotiation. What hypocrisy? Iran doesn't allow Israelis because 1. Israel has still refused to pay billions in debt it owes to Iran, 2. Israel admitted that it conducted sabotage on Iran's centrifuges (something the US would consider an act of war), and 3. traveling to Israel as an Iranian isn't exactly a cake walk. >Iran does not recognize Israel tho.

  What difference does that make? We could choose to not recognize countries that don't recognize Israel, but we don't, because we usually don't set the bar at what a given ayatollah decides is reasonable policy.  >About the hijab, I don't find it anything that problematic. It's a custom, it's a law, female attendants can choose to not serve the route.   That's not how equality works. That's like, ""gay people are free to marry whomever they like, as long as it's someone of the opposite gender"" as a defense of anti-white marriage policy. >The thread is not about America, it's about Air France, and Air France is being a hypocrit here.   No, they're standing up to a grandstanding asshole from a country they need to be civil with. Which will not happen with a incompetent President. And don't bring Iran, France doesn't give a fuck about Iran, Iran doesn't impact their country like America does. They're holding us to a higher standard than an oppressive theocratical regime, how dare they.  Don't confuse a company and its union, thanks. it's not a bout Air France, but Air france union.  > The thread is not about America  You're not very bright, are you? nop, not bein a hypocrit , pls read an actual sourc Not hypocrisy either, he's not telling the whole story. The union complained, and women can choose to not fly to Tehran. If they don't want to wear a hijab. So you're attacking arguments with an ad hominem attack? Thats intellectual but idiot to you. > I get the suspicion that a big part of the issue is that the US is doing this rather than some small backwater country that isn't our problem and easier to hand wave.   No, that Air France union has definitely complained about the other issues like ""forcing"" women to wear hijab, this issue is just being reported because Trump brings A LOT of clicks right now.  An Air france union (there are like 10) complained when we didn't get payed work-at-night salary (bonus) when there was a solar eclipse 2 years ago that made the sky grey. However, those countries still dont accept Israeli passports. Its more like ""These people are discriminating, Get them"" and ""Why dont you say anything about the exact same discrimination another place is currently doing?""  My guess is that the French Union doesn't want to get Charlie Hebdo'd. Just my theory.  Two wrongs still dont make a right tho, I agree with that.  > I get the suspicion that a big part of the issue is that the US is doing this rather than some small backwater country that isn't our problem and easier to hand wave.   There's no mystery here. US is literally the most important country in the world. It's pretty naive to suggest otherwise. If they do stupid shit, it's absolutely way more impactful for everybody involved, and therefore, way more of an issue. Of course people are going to react more to this than similar offenses done by different countries. Should every group of power be constantly worried about every other group being perfectly fair and good across the board? Well, yeah, in an ideal world, but that's obviously never going to happen. And pointing this fact out is useless. Why do it? Why make posts like this (the one that /u/Hazz91 made)? It discourages discussion about the fact that things are headed in a real shitty direction right now, something that I think we (/u/Hazz91 included) can all agree is something we should deal with. Is it that similar offenses elsewhere should be dealt with as well? Again, that is nearly an impossible task to accomplish. And people have to prioritize. I'm sure you're not surprised to hear that there are more than 1 shitty thing going on in this planet. Just because the US doing something gets #1 spot on the list of things people pay attention to, doesn't mean the next country doing the same deserves spot #2.  My daughter, who is Jewish from her mother's side is actually planning her free birthright trip to Israel. I am well aware of the demographic. It isn't. Looking in your direction Italy.. Kinda like needing a nice pair to work at hooters? Personally i believe miniskirts should be mandatory for everyone, so yes. Yes actually I might be  There are *tons* of companies that require their employees to wear certain revealing clothing. um... yes? Well, that's not really gonna help your case. Yes, and while that may be true, I was always under the impression that Air France's gesture to implement hijabs for their female air staff was a sign of good will and respect towards that country's tradition.   Also, an exclamation point? Really? they should go on strike! Nah, not all French unions are like this. But this is the CGT at Air France... Yeah, but in this case it is legitimate. This is not about their own interests, but to take a stance against facistoid discrimination and to keep their people from having to enforce that discrimination.  Edit: from a reply i made further down to clarify:  >facistoid ""Something that is similiar to or an element of facism in some regard but not 100% equivalent"" I didnt say the US is facist or that this qualifies the US as facist, but that in its essence it is something aligned with facism. The discrimination of an entire people based on their nationality and/or religion is something that is facistoid as it is something likely to occur under facism and congruent with facist values and ideas. I'm a lefty, but this bothers me too. Let's stick to the facts, please. Multinational corporations benefit more from immigration than any other person or entity in the world. They love green cards and H1B programs because they bring in cheaper labor.  Corporations are not benevolent. Ever. Onion piece just wrote itself. Don't be mad that your candidate lost dude And where were all these racists and narcissists and bigots and yes men in the past 2 elections? Hmmm... Do you think all citizens of all countries should be fingerprinted? No, the travel ban from Iraq was implemented once it was discovered that a terrorist cell was hiding among refugees.    If you are bluecollar, anything over 35 hours is considered overtime.  Take a deep breath, Europeans make these same jokes about America. The whole 'Murica stereotype is just that, a stereotype.  /s = surrender? I lived in France for 12 years, commuted there weekly for 6 more. Yes, they ARE constantly on strike.  Worker-employer relations are incredibly adversarial compared to other European countries. But hey, if you think that  is an inaccurate and lazy stereotype you can move there and enjoy the public transport. France is an islamic annex of Pakistan. Someone on Reddit complained we're always on strike. Days since strike: 0 I dont mean governmentally more person to person.  To clarify what this guy means, some or all of these countries ban their own citizens from going to Israel  Start looking for real solutions, rather than jumping on whichever trendy protest is seemingly most popular for one...  I absolutely guarantee this is cementing Trump's resolve.  Right or wrong, he'll bulldog harder the more people complain.  From what I understand, his next step is to deport immigrants that are, or likely to be on social assistance programs.    Technically correct, the best kind of right.  Yeah, but the others have been for millenia What one issue. America is already held up to multitude of Standards. Hell Islamic countries are not even held up to one. Its like we know we know, they are all savages and trying to do anything about it is like skating up a hill.  ...that's the point.  The actual point is that the French unions aren't encouraging it's members to refuse to go to locations that restrict travel in the same manner.  i.e. the countries listed in the top of this comment thread.    Wow...unreal. Gasp, but it does?! But ... that would mean I've been lied to about the nature and benefit of unionized workers! And I'm too smart to fall for that! Weird, there are shitloads of corrupt and greedy companies that have forced people out of work and yet they don't seem to be making the news. I wonder if the same people that own the 6 major media companies in this country might also have a vested interest in crushing unions.   *shakes head sadly* The unintended consequence of French labour reform was that instead of creating more workplaces it made prductivity go through the roof. Here's a relevant quote from FP:  >Labour productivity  the amount of output per worker or hour worked  is substantially higher there [i.e. France] and, since the financial crisis, has grown faster than in the UK. Data show that in 2013, output per worker in France was 13 per cent higher than in the UK. But because Britons work longer hours than the French, on a comparison of GDP per hour, the difference jumops to a whopping 27 per cent. No, it is not necessarily better. I do agree with that. My point was more about how hours can be ""inflated"". See the guy who mentioned his 8hr day included walks around a lake and paid lunch, for example. That still would come out to a ""40 hr work week"".   Instead, I think many companies may have employees who overreport hours in the US and while it may happen in france (per my example) there is less need to overreport if you are required to work less.    What if your immediate boss is waiting to get fired?  No joke, there were like 4 guys who were constantly brought up as ""they're just waiting to get fired"" and it was one of them who oversaw the other 3. :) Well. If he does so he'll have a nice time in court for doing so. That part is changing though. Thanks to the traitorous cunts in the current government that passed right-wing economic reform that gutted pretty hard labour rights. You can be fired much more easily now. Higher incomes are handy when you have to pay $150,000 for an MRI.  (For reference I've had many and haven't paid a cent in Australia due to our terrible universal health care system) It heavily depends. I can safely say my current employee handbook for Our office specifies 8hours per day, not including lunch.   Now, I do agree:employee handbook vs actual conditions are different, and certain industries (especially tech industries) would rather you work a highly productive/innovative 32 hours than work a mediocre 40 hours. But you're still expected to ""work"" those 40 hours in most company policies even if it isn't enforced.  Svensken er slet ikke til at f je p. Excellent, we beat Finland once again! From a statistical point of view, with a population of 500,000, how relevant is Luxembourg?  It's like if a school of only 10 choosen students would be on top of the world rank of schools just because.. it had 10 good students at that time compared to a school with thousands of very different students.. i like this one : http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2010$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj3XYThRy0yJMA;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj2tPLxKvvnNPA;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID0;by=grp$map_x;scale=lin;dataMin=1.121;dataMax=23$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=23;dataMax=86$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds= [removed] Yes, but the biggest share of contributions come from employer tax, and the government doesn't pay it for its employees. For instance public employees pension contributions only finance 25% of the system. The rest is paid by general taxes and debt.  You must look at the total cost of a salary for a company to get the picture: http://m.imgur.com/NyoZ2HW?r That employer share, the employees pay it too one way or another as it reduces their company margins https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita Your claim does not contradict mine, so I fail to see why you brought it up. It still does not explain why union membership is much, much lower than countries with similar levels of protection through labor laws. It's less than half of Germany's or the Netherland's rate for instance, and about 1/7th or 1/8th of the Scandinavian countries.  If only people knew about the facts of a subject before having a shitty opinion about it. ""Do it or don't get paid"" isn't really a good bargaining position  Wow doesn't that kind of impact the careers of female stewardesses and pilots then?  That should be the reason for not being complicit. News flash. Just because you voted for someone in a two party system, doesn't mean you support every opinion they have. This goes for either party.  Then why are we praising them for protesting trump? You a freak > That's not how equality works.  It's not up to you to decide what Iran's law have to be.  It's up to you to decide if you want to visit the place or not, if you want to work in that place or not.  You're free to disagree and criticize the customs and laws of Iran, but you gotta respect them.  It's the same with Air France flight attendants.  They might disagree with this hijab law, but nobody's forcing them to serve this specific route so either they respect this law or face the consequences of not respecting it.  If I read a news about an Air France fly attendant being arrested for not wearing a hijab I would understand that. Yes, I disagree with the law itself, but I respect it regardless.  When I was in Dubai and Qatar me and my mother respected local laws even when we disagreed with them.  That's exactly what we expect foreigners that come to Europe to do. Respect local laws even if they disagree with them.  You can't wear a Burqa in public in Europe in most places and we don't care about your religion/opinion. You must be visible and people must be able to identify you. If a motorbiker enters a bank with his helmet on he can expect to face problems and fines too.  That's our laws and everybody has to respect them even if they disagree, the same way we're supposed to respect them in other countries. Indeed. Don't they know we are trying to start a Christian country where the Bill of Rights is a useless document, except when it comes to owning guns? So why are you so assmad that visas for them are limited for a short amount of time?  No, I'm attacking people with an ad hominem attack. Just to confirm then, Air France's union did try to push against the hijab thing? ^^^^^hijabiness? Mmm, I was raised to support the right thing, rather than to support the right thing when convenient, so I think we may have slightly different opinions on this. Thank you for the feedback, though :D > People from Israel have no fucking reason to go to Iran!  Also the Tomb of Esther and Mordechai (at least according to tradition) Mile high bunga bunga. Especially the blokes eh? Forcing people to wear a religious garb, because of sensitivity. Makes sense. By the same token should not Iran air require all its female staff to remove the hijab when flying to the developed west. Out of respect for our traditions. >tradition  You mean pandering towards their oppressive Islamic fundamentalist bullshit? That sounds about right.  Forcing someone to cover their head because the men their can't stop raping if they see more than a woman's jawline isn't about respect it's about money and enabling their terrible traditions and beliefs. Dont give them idea. You are right. And as you can guess, i just assumed it was CGT-like. A bit sensationalist but not too far off. Sure, fascist. There are many definitions of that term, but im getting tired of seing that thrown all around. What is yours? Mine would probably be this one: a political system headed by a dictator in which the government controls business and labor and opposition is not permitted.    Now, from an American point of view, it can be seen as a valid mean to protect its population from terrorist attack. Maybe not the best nor the most justified, but how is keeping people from entering your country fascist? So no more terrorist cells are hiding among refugees, correct? Have you seen the American president? Till the election results came in? I would have agreed.  Post that? Americans literally voted for a ""Murica"" stereotype that got elected because he kept saying ""Murica"". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_history_of_France then i assure you it's not the case :) As american like to see us as the arrogant country we are, we see the american the same way, but it's more in a friendly way Reminds me of a joke I saw on reddit the other day about a judge having a jurisprudence  fetish. He got off on a technicality.  No one is arguing that. >Yeah, but the others have been for millenia   And how does that have any bearing on America having existed for centuries? > the French unions aren't encouraging it's members to refuse to go to locations that restrict travel in the same manner  No, the point is that they are...   They literally said the same thing about Iran.   There is no difference. That is the point as repeated many, many times in this thread.  I agree in general that unions are good, bu as a rational counterpoint, I will say that a lot of the Unions here in Quebec are pretty shit, especially in the construction business. No you can't.  Though firing requirements can be changed with the agreement of employee delegates and/or union of the sector (""accord de branche"")  If you get fired ""easily"" without protection it's because you elected a dumbass as employee delegate. Take your responsibilities. The state can't micro-manage every case. If you have a high income it's very likely you have access to employer supplied health benefits.  Hey something I can relate to! I've had my cat scanned and spent a couple night in the hospital in both the US and Australia. Oz didn't cost me a penny for the whole shebang, while the US cost about $6k out of pocket. Without insurance, it would have been closer to $20k.  Now obviously, we pay insurance premiums, you pay higher taxes, so you're not getting off scot free, but man, that streamlined experience in an emergency situation sure was nice. Not to mention the societal benefits of offering strings free care to everyone! Anywho, we need to get our shit together. And your country is fucking dope. Combines the best of the USA/Canada and Great Britain/Ireland. Now that I think about it, is there a buddy system in the Anglosphere, with a bigger more powerful country teamed up with a smaller more progressive buddy who in some ways resent each other but mostly get along pretty well these days? Seems to be working out well enough so far. Hope you enjoyed the ramble. Bad example.  There are independent MRI clinics in the US that charge low prices.  As a result, even a hospital charges far less now.  Edit: Am I wrong?  > you have to pay $150,000 for an MRI  Pull numbers out of your ass much?    You can buy a used 1.5 Tesla MRI for $300-400K.  THE ENTIRE MACHINE.    [Prices here](https://info.blockimaging.com/1.5t-mri-machine-price-cost-guide) Danskjvlar  Too busy having fika.  Bitterballen for everyone! There's always been comments by gullible and poorly informed people about high taxes in Europe.  When they learn how much money Europeans spend in healthcare and education (and daycare) compared to how much they pay, they laugh a little less.    As I agree with your comments, I am not sure I am getting your point.   US companies pay for their employees health care too, except it's not government run. A *lot* per capita more than French companies do due to the absurd cost of healthcare in the US. And it..reduces companies margins too.  and, on top of it, American people pay for their healthcare also A LOT more than French people do.   I'm showing you gdp per hour, you're showing me total.  We can go on like this for quite a while.

For Germany, you'd think their impressive manufacture sector is one of the reasons why they have strong union memberships ([IG Metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IG_Metall) is the biggest industrial union in the western world), but I have to say for the Netherlands, I have no idea. And if a frog had wings it wouldn't bump its ass when it hops. Maybe he had some alternative facts. /s You ask too much.  How would it? I don't understand the question.  [removed] > News flash. Just because you voted for someone in a two party system, doesn't mean you support every opinion they have. This goes for either party.   By the same token a Union is not complicit for an airline's actions in a given state.  I mean you'd think this equivalency was obvious. a) You're just a voter who voted in the government  b) Unions are not bodies of infinite power and cannot fight every battle Easy there cowboy Trumps no government.  Nice backpedal there, anti-vaxxer. Um... I'm guessing you didn't realize that was a mis-translation which has been widely debunked... Iran has never threatened to wipe anyone off the face of the earth and there is no actual idiom in persian that correlates to wipe off the face of the earth.   The US has been accused of sponsoring ISIS - are we now sponsors of terrorism?  Here we call those groups freedom fighters... Idk man, if it comes to sponsoring of terror and vile dictators? The US has zero standing there. It's an act of bigoted cowardice. It's punishing a group of people for the actions of a completely different group of people... for starters.  So you're aware that you're wrong then. Good I'm not 100% sure, but I think I remember one or two papers from some union about it (we get spammed in the company mailbox and they come put papers on our desks).  I also am not really aware of everything as we have 2 (or 3?) categories of union, one for people that stay on the ground, one for people that actually fly (to be simple)  EDIT : that's what I thought, at least the union dedicated to the flight attendants made some noise about it (http://www.leparisien.fr/laparisienne/societe/paris-teheran-le-voile-de-la-discorde-sur-la-future-ligne-air-france-02-04-2016-5681193.php it says that the main union SNPNC doesn't want the flight attendants to be forced to wear a hijab in their professional uniform, altought it understands that it might be required for them to wear one if they decide to leave the airport to do personnal things) It's not about what's convenient.  The same people that are speaking up on this topic were speaking up on global warming before, or the Syrian war, or human rights violations in various countries, or the UK leaving the EU, or net neutrality, or terror attacks in major European cities, etc.  Are you suggesting people drop all of the things they find problematic in the world to specifically focus on Iran banning visas from Israel? Only because the most powerful country in the world, the self proclaimed beacon of liberty and free speech, just started doing the same thing? Certainly you could try to argue that this is more important than some of the things I randomly happened to list in the start of my post, but it should be obvious that certain problems resonate more with people, and we don't have unlimited attention span. Of course we're going to focus more on the things that affect us, or the people (countries) around us.   Let me make a perhaps slightly hyperbolic comparison: North Korea is a brutal dictatorship where people are hung for no good reason, if they haven't managed to starve to death before that happens. And when that country comes up, what you see on Reddit mostly, is sarcastic jokes about KJU related propaganda (glorious leader and all that). If Trump suddenly starts executing people who disagree with him, are you going to come into a discussion about that by saying ""but when North Korea did that, nobody batted an eye""... ? Of course not. Nobody is arguing this is acceptable in NK. Unfortunately, there is no easy solution to some problems, and we are forced to divert our attention somewhere else. The world is a pretty shitty place - less shitty than it's ever been - but still pretty shitty, and if we, the ones fortunate enough to live in relatively peaceful and stable areas - want to take advantage of this luck by enjoying any part of our lives, then we have to prioritize the rest of the time that we spend worrying about - and some even actually trying to help solve - the injustices in the world.  It works in Star Trek. I like kilts. But the garb is traditional Iranian garb!  (Implemented in 1979 by an islamist regime)   I didn't know we had a specific custom not to wear a hijab. I thought it was more of wear whatever you want, including a hijab..  Out of curiosity. All airlines mandate uniforms for cabin staff. If a western airline's uniform includes a cap that covers the hair, will you object to it as you object to hIjabs? Or is the rest of the uniform okay, just not the head covering? Let's say Iran suddenly became ultra progressive and decided clothes were unnecessary, you would seriously be ok with a bunch of naked hairy dudes wandering around your airport? I have no opinion formed on the matter but they are already forcing them to wear a uniform. Now they have to wear a different one. I don't think that sounds so bad. In disneyland some employers must wear costumes and we don't riot over it.  please do not confuse Iran with India. Rape is a serious crime in Iran.  >facistoid  ""Something that is similiar to or an element of facism in some regard but not 100% equivalent""  I didnt say the US is facist or that this qualifies the US as facist, but that in its essence it is something aligned with facism.  The discrimination of an entire people based on their nationality and/or religion is something that is facistoid as it is something likely to occur under facism and congruent with facist values and ideas.  It's possible some are trying to hide in the flow, but, considering the screening refugees from Muslim countries have to go through (especially since that Iraq refugee problem under Obama) very unlikely and if they do, probably would be discovered and dismantled.     The timescale is completely changed and you cannot expect a country's politics to be flawless if other countries which have been around for much longer haven't either.  Iran does not appear in that article title, nor in the body of the article.  I'm trying to understand why you don't understand explicitly what I'm saying.  If what you say is true about the union encouraging it's employees to not travel to Iran, you're proving my point.  This article clearly says its encouragement to not serve US flights is out of protest.  I'd like to see your source indicating the Iranian flights are being affected in the same manner. I had a high income in the US, only qualified once for healthcare at 6% of my salary out of 10 different companies. Still had out of pocket expenses even with that plan.  I think not having good healthcare or any healthcare even if you earn a decent wage and work 40+h per week happens way more than people realize. It's funny how backwards that seems Did they feed the cat after scanning it?  Still a good example, buddy hasn't paid a cent. I'm American with insurance and I know our system sucks. How does everyone not agree on this? Well that's handy, just the other day I got my MRI equipment usage certification  They do? In my experience they reply with ""NATO freeloading"", ""Wouldn't work in the USA."", ""USA pays for all R&D."" or ""Homogeneous countries can do that, not diverse ones."" I don't have figures for US labor costs, but having been employed by a Texas company I can assure you it's nowhere near what a company would pay in France. However you're right that in the US the health care system is very costly, but that's a different issue.  To get back on unions which I commented about first, my point was that they're not the reason we have social security. It's the french people as a whole that collectively decided after WW2 to tax (private) labor. Our unions are now heavily politicized and represent a minority of the population that do not pay those taxes. If anything they're helping the decline of our system that sadly could eventually end up by partial or full privatization (but that's just my opinion) Idk man maybe he's into that  But it is literally the job of the airline union to take care of their employees. It is not however trumps job to look after the best interest foreigners, but to attempt to look after the welfare of Americans however misguided you think the attempt may be.  I'm glad you didn't have a serious response to hijabi Air France. You're insane > Um... I'm guessing you didn't realize that was a mis-translation which has been widely debunked... Iran has never threatened to wipe anyone off the face of the earth and there is no actual idiom in persian that correlates to wipe off the face of the earth.  Except that debunking has been widely debunked.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/did-ahmadinejad-really-say-israel-should-be-wiped-off-the-map/2011/10/04/gIQABJIKML_blog.html  >  But the story doesnt end there. Karim Sadjadpour, an Iranian specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, notes that Iranian government entities began to erect billboards and signs with the wipe off phrase in English. Joshua Teitelbaum of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs compiled an interesting collection of photographs of these banners, such as one on the building that houses reserve military forces of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Israel should be wiped out of the face of the world, the sign reads in English.   http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/11/weekinreview/11bronner.html  > But translators in Tehran who work for the president's office and the foreign ministry disagree with them. All official translations of Mr. Ahmadinejad's statement, including a description of it on his Web site (www.president.ir/eng/), refer to wiping Israel away. Sohrab Mahdavi, one of Iran's most prominent translators, and Siamak Namazi, managing director of a Tehran consulting firm, who is bilingual, both say ""wipe off"" or ""wipe away"" is more accurate than ""vanish"" because the Persian verb is active and transitive.  > But to others, ""occupying regime"" signals more than opposition to a certain government; the phrase indicates the depth of the Iranian president's rejection of a Jewish state in the Middle East because he refuses even to utter the name Israel. He has said that the Palestinian issue ""does not lend itself to a partial territorial solution"" and has called Israel ""a stain"" on Islam that must be erased. By contrast, Mr. Ahmadinejad's predecessor, Mohammad Khatami, said that if the Palestinians accepted Israel's existence, Iran would go along.  The only fair point is that that comment at least did not imply immediate action from Iran to destroy Israel.  ---  > The US has been accused of sponsoring ISIS - are we now sponsors of terrorism? Here we call those groups freedom fighters...  Except we haven't sponsored ISIS, Iran has sponsored Hamas and Hezbollah Which translation, Iran is always threatening someone?   Iran test-fired two ballistic missiles, one of them with the phrase ""Israel should be wiped off the Earth"" written on it in **Hebrew**, Iranian news media reported Wednesday.  They've been attacking us for decades through their little puppets.   > The US has been accused of sponsoring ISIS - are we now sponsors of terrorism?  Yeah, and we should fuck off with our monkeying around in everyone's business. That's one thing we can agree on.  Okay! This is looking a bit better in that case, it's largely just Trump who's drawing attention to everything. I'm glad these people have been sticking up for what they feel is right all from the start :D An ""islamist regime"" that was legitimately brought into power by the people of Iran peacefully revolting against an US instated Dictator who ursurped their democratically elected president 20 years prior and treated his people like shit.  EDit: apperently many people don't know much about the history of Iran:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d'%C3%A9tat  >Results:  Successful overthrow of Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh  General Fazlollah Zahedi, appointed as prime minister of post-coup military government[1][2] by Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi.

Iran becomes buffer zone against Middle Eastern Soviet expansion  Period of discontent among Iranians, climaxing in Iranian Revolution  >The 1953 Iranian coup d'tat, known in Iran as the 28 Mordad coup (Persian:   ), was the overthrow of the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in favour of strengthening the monarchical rule of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi on 19 August 1953, orchestrated by the United Kingdom (under the name ""Operation Boot"") and the United States (under the name TPAJAX Project, or ""Operation Ajax"").  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution  >Causes   Discontent with the Shah's rule  Exile of Ayatollah Khomeini  Social injustice  Western imperialism  Religious motives  >Methods   Demonstrations  Strikes  Civil resistance  >Result   Overthrow of the Shah and monarchy  1979 energy crisis  Establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran headed by Velayat-e-Faqih with referendum  Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran replaced Persian Constitution of 1906 with referendum  Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini becomes the new Supreme Leader of Iran  Iran hostage crisis  IranIraq War begins  >The Iranian Revolution (also known as the Islamic Revolution or the 1979 Revolution;[4][5][6][7][8][9]) refers to events involving the overthrow of the Pahlavi dynasty under Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, who was supported by the United States[10] and its eventual replacement with an Islamic republic under the Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the revolution, supported by various leftist and Islamist organizations[11] and Iranian student movements.  >Demonstrations against the Shah commenced in October 1977, developing into a campaign of civil resistance that included both secular and religious elements[12][13][14] and which intensified in January 1978.[15] Between August and December 1978 strikes and demonstrations paralyzed the country. The Shah left Iran for exile on January 16, 1979, as the last Persian monarch, leaving his duties to a regency council and an opposition-based prime minister. Ayatollah Khomeini was invited back to Iran by the government,[16][17] and returned to Tehran to a greeting by several million Iranians.[18] The royal reign collapsed shortly after on February 11 when guerrillas and rebel troops overwhelmed troops loyal to the Shah in armed street fighting, bringing Khomeini to official power.[19][20] Iran voted by national referendum to become an Islamic Republic on April 1, 1979,[21] and to approve a new theocratic-republican constitution[12][13][22][23] whereby Khomeini became Supreme Leader of the country, in December 1979.  >The revolution was unusual for the surprise it created throughout the world:[24] it lacked many of the customary causes of revolution (defeat at war, a financial crisis, peasant rebellion, or disgruntled military),[25] occurred in a nation that was enjoying relative prosperity,[16][23] produced profound change at great speed,[26] was massively popular, resulted in the exile of many Iranians,[27] and replaced a pro-Western monarchy[16] with an anti-Western authoritarian theocracy[16][22][23][28][29] based on the concept of Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists (or velayat-e faqih). It was a relatively non-violent revolution, and helped to redefine the meaning and practice of modern revolutions (although there was violence in its aftermath).[30] Its probably more related to the symbol of the head covering. A regular hat is not a symbol of Islam. I wouldn't want to be forced to embrace a symbol of an ideology that I disagree with.  Are you comparing a woman's head without a cloth to a naked man with his jewels hanging out? Yes I would much prefer everyone being naked and free to wear what they want and if naked is that let em swing. Much better than let's cover you from head to toe because your face is evil. Just saying 'it is a costume' belies the terrible theocracy that pushes it.   If Disney insisted black employees wear Klan robes - would that be cool?  It's ""just a costume"" - right?  #dicksoutforGoofy Yes it is.  The victims are stoned to death. Yes it is punishable by stoning.   So remember ladies,  just shut up and take it if you don't want to be executed with the gays.  Doesn't the US have one of the oldest political systems in the world? IIRC it's like third oldest next to Iceland and isle of man or something. Nah just me. get a certificate of need (depending on the state), some licenses, a tax id, a billing company, insurance contracts, and a radiologist, and you're all set  >I don't have figures for US labor costs, but having been employed by a Texas company I can assure you it's nowhere near what a company would pay in France  We're talking about healthcare cost here and health contributions by companies, not labor cost. This is a different issue.    >To get back on unions which I commented about first, my point was that they're not the reason we have social security. It's the french people as a whole that collectively decided after WW2 to tax (private) labor  That's inaccurate. The *Scurit Sociale* and before that *assurances sociales* were initiated by corporations of workers. [Here](https://www.cairn.info/revue-les-tribunes-de-la-sante-2008-1-page-29.htm) is an article about it, in French.  ""Social Security"" in the US means retirement, by the way, not health coverage.  >The decline of our system.  is debatable.   That's not true, it's a communist deputy and work minister, Ambroise Croizat, that created La Scurit Sociale in 1945, by joining all separate private insurance companies together, against all ""socialists"", center and right deputies.  By doing so, the cost were lower, and quality was better, as you know. The management was made by the workers themselves, with great results. Every worker, private or public pays cotisations. My father stuck straws up frog's butts and blew them up. I don't know why  he peppered their bellies though. > But it is literally the job of the airline union to take care of their employees.  Union's cannot fight every battle and as some concession was already made by the airline (hostesses were offered work on other flights if they disagreed) they chose not to.  As a voter you are literally the person empowering Trump. The equivalency is even more evident on that end.  > It is not however trumps job to look after foreigners,  Trump is explicitly responsible for foreigners within the United States. How do you not know this? Truth is, it's actually much more likely that someone who willingly supports someone who is strongly against vaccinations is also anti-vax themselves, than it is for a union to be ""complicit"" in a company's actions, when their job is simply to protect the employees' interests. He's a paid $hill probably, when they run out of arguments their script tells them to call you shit like that as a last resort.  Iran has sponsored Hamas and Hezbollah. Of the two, Hezbollah only target Israeli combatants.  The US has sponsored,  * Hezb-e-Islami (Google them up), * The Nicaraguan Contas - the ICJ even ruled that the US was grossly in violation of human rights here, but am sure that as an American, you don't care for international law, after all USA USA USA! * CURO - Cuban Terror outfit, * Brigade of God - an Iranian / Balochi Islamic terror outfit. * MeK - Iranian terror outfit again, * Atlacatl Battalion - El Salvadorian terror outfit, * FRAPH - Haiti,  Aside from these ""freedom fighters and brave warriors"", America has and still supports Drug lords in Afghanistan, Somali Warlords (these guys used to be paid $ 100,000 per week, in cash by CIA handlers), warlords in Africa.  OFC, these are all chump change when you look at the dictators and tyrants the US has created, aided and supported (and still supports).  Go ahead, tell me how bad Iran is. meh, you sponsored the Taliban, essentially the precurser to ISIS. Also a terrorism group.  There might be additional noise coming from AF in the next days, one of the unions wants to sue the company for being too...overzealous in how they applied Trump's ban.  Anyway, I know it's repeated quite a lot, but there's nothing better to reduce your perceived level of knowledge on some subjects thanks to the medias than actually hearing the medias talk about a field you really know about...You realize they say ton of crap or outright lie. I will definitely try to keep that in my the next time I argue about something I feel like I understand through some reddit worldnews posts and one or two TV shows...  Yes, the west hs been fighting islamists for a long time.  The point is the veil is not traditional iranian garb.  Actual the revolution was A backed by CIA and B overtaken by violent islamists who have turned round and oppressed the people far worse.  It's a relative thing. I don't like the suit and tie, it's a symbol of the rat race and the tie slowly strangles me through the day. But hey, it's working dress in many occupations, so you gotta put on the monkey suit, like it or not.  Plenty of actors and models wear ridiculous costumes as part of the job. Non Christians or atheists may don a red coat and fake beard and stand on the sidewalk ringing bells and going ho-ho-ho when they really don't give a fuck about Christmas. Money makes us all do things we wouldn't have done by choice.  Now it's true that if you bring in Islam and ideology and hijab-is-a-symbol-of-oppression, matters can get more serious. But it's still a matter of choice, you don't *have* to get offended unless you want to. Plenty of non-Muslim women put on a hijab in Saudi Arabia or Iran, and take it off again the instant they leave. They think nothing of it, it's just part of the job, like the uniform.  You could take it a step further. Plenty of uniforms for women try to deliberately make them look more provocative, because the women are part of the service being sold to the customer. Hooters costumes, uniforms that show too much leg or cleavage. Many women might not actually enjoy wearing them, they might be uncomfortable with the attention the dress draws, they might even be ideologically opposed to such a crude display of boobs and butt, but they put it aside, they let themselves be objectified, because it pays the rent.  How then is an ideological rejection of headgear such a different category? If a hijab is a symbol of oppression, can't a hooters' costume be a symbol of sexual objectification to some woman, ideologically abhorrent? And yet they both do it for money, because people do a lot of fucking annoying stuff for money. Why is one more serious than the other, why does one become an ideological crusade?  In the case of airlines, it's actually *less* onerous. On Air France and many other airlines, female cabin staff may ask to be reassigned to a different route that doesn't go through Iran if they prefer. At no penalty to themselves. I doubt other women get the chance to wear more modest clothing when the employer demands revealing. Then it's ""tits or GTFO"".  I think both sides exaggerate the seriousness or triviality of the hijab to suit their agendas. It's not nothing, but it's not the horror some people pretend it is either. Are you claiming that your idea of what decent clothing entails is right and every other idea is wrong and not worth to be respected? Do you realize the hypocricsy here? And maybe that you can't claim freedom as a value of yours here while discriminating against others? Considering the first British prime minister was before the US was even a country, going to have to go with no on that.  Also, /r/shitamericanssay. Well that's something. Meow you have good day.  what an interesting thing to discover in my inbox haha Isn't  this really what it boils down to? Some people want us to look after the best interest of our country and people  first and then look after the interest of others. I am not saying he is right in the ban. I have not looked at the percentage of problems of people coming from those region nor on the effect of the economies and crime rates of where they are. Yes we should make foreigners who live and work here safe and to make sure they are not being prosecuted, discriminated against, or targeted by others.   However I do not think this is what he is doing. I assume he is trying to make it safer in the country for everyone and putting something in place while he hammers out the details of his more extensive process of looking into who is coming into our borders.   I am genuinely sorry this does not line up with how you believe things should be done, but if it is in the better interest of our country and people. I do not think it should change. I am going to give it some time and see what happens before I become a irate over something that can be easily changed. As in when it is clear it is creating a problem for our country or  people as a whole.  > to protect the employees' interests.  Sort of like standing up for a woman's right to say no to wearing a hijab.  Your logic is backwards.. Wtf This is not a/the truth at all. It's, at best, a hypothesis, or dare I even say guess? One that would be hard to test, at that. Yeah, though it's hard to get to the bottom of these through all the opinions-posted-as-facts :/ The ursurping of the secular democratically elected president wasn't about fighting islamists. It was about keeping Iran to impose their right to their own natural ressources. The rise of Islamism was a result of that action, not a cause for that action. Wew.     What it really boils down to is that there is a stark difference between a work uniform you dislike because of comfort reasons ( be they physical or mental, but if you're working at hooters and uncomfortable you're doing it wrong. Just start serving at another restaurant ) and a visual que that associates you with a religious ideology.       Especially when that ideology condones oppressing women, violence against gays and non-believers and in some cases child marriage.     Totally not the same thing.  Woah son, calm yourself. You still didn't answer my question. I'm asking if you personally see it that way. I think you're a bit confused. The American President, as head of State and Government, regardless of who he is, is responsible for both the actions and welfare of foreigners within his borders, just as other governments are responsible for Americans abroad and hold them under their protection and/or punishment.   This isn't really a case of what you believe to be true or not, this is the way the world is. It's a bit shocking that this should come as a surprise to you. You mean like accusing a company of whatever you feel like because your feelings are hurt?  That's hardly an argument. If a waitress at hooters can change her job, why not an airline stewardess? Maybe *she's* in the wrong job flying all over the world, dealing with foreign people and customs, if she can't adapt.  As for symbols, you can pile on as much shit as you want on either. You can pin all the evils of Islam on the hijab if you like. But someone else may pin the whole sexual objectification of women on being forced to wear revealing costumes and having their worth judged on the basis of their tits and ass. On what objective basis do you claim they are entirely different things and one is much worse than the other?

"10",9,"5r81nh","2017-01-31","Would seem that 'America first' actually means alienating all your allies and standing alone. The US government was never all too trustworthy and reliable. Well he is a former ambassador, so yea.  Then get your shit together and stop being a failed state. I wonder if Scott Adams could polish this turd? Trump didn't make any agreements with Iraq. Neither did the American people. Ok? I'm sorry he feels that way, but he has to follow the order like everyone else, I'm not sure why his opinion matters more than anyone else who has already voiced their anger. He adds nothing new. All the better for Russia to weaken Nato It's almost as if putting someone who showed no real understanding of the role of the US in the international order in charge; someone who has never shown any inclination towards public service, was a bad idea.   Gee, if only the media had perhaps dwelled on that a bit more...instead of emails.    That is exactly what it's always been. America first, none second.  The downside to ""America first"" is that there's nobody second that wants to back them up... welcome to fascism. Pft...yeah because we need Iraq... They actually made lots of agreements with Iraqi citizens who acted as translators for our military forces, to give them US visas and let them in as refugees, seeing as they'd be targets after collaborating with the US.  But US left many Iraqi cities in ruins and then gave the rebuilding money to corrupt people, who then ""gifted"" US officials. Now those corrupt people are but hurt.  You broke it, you bought it. Damn your dumb. How do you put your shoes on? Left foot in the right shoe or what? I need to know - you're some kind of special. R u dum? because certain people who are known to be safe should have an exception if they reason for the ban is to keep unsafe people out. If you aren't unsafe then you shouldn't get banned. Common sense really.  Exhibit A: Basic troll I honestly don't get what you could possibly like about this ban. The two countries responsible for islamic terrorism seem to be saudi arabia and pakistan, which are not banned. Plus the ban includes everyone, regardless of situation, even people who supported and risked their lives aiding the US during wars.  I don't understand how American citizens can have such disregard for people who suffered so much because of them. For the 50 or so victims of terrorism from the banned countries, the US caused tens of thousands. What compels you to behave as victims in this situation? And when terrorist attacks keep happening despite the ban, what will you do next? ""give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses"" This move primarily sends Iraq further into the hands of its real regional ally: Iran. To be fair, it also weakens the EU so the U.S. Might have better leverage when it comes to trade deals. I've only just realised that this may have influenced Donald Trump's support for Brexit.  We should be working with Russia. I wonder if Putin suggested banning people from 'terrorist countries' when he spoke to Trump. Sure said that when you invaded Yep, I think the US will have trouble finding translators and such in the future! Handshakes don't count  Refugees can go to the next country over. You mean economic migrant That's Trumps fault how? Well their suffering isn't the fault of American citizens as a whole. That's like blaming the average German for the Holocaust. Some people I'm charge did bad things, that does not make the average citizen a bad person But nothing about Healthcare right?  Wait iraq and iran allies? After what hussein did to iran?  How things have changed Good, its about time we let an Middle Eastern country clean up the mess we have have been making there for 60 years. You assume a lot. >Yep, I think the US will have trouble finding translators and such in the future!   I personally don't. They could simply... I don't know, pay the translator? Money?  Also, did these act as translators and were the promises made during Trump's presidency? In all honesty he's gone full isolationist and that's exactly what he promised, I don't know why people are still bitching about his foreign policy lol  https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/immigrate/iraqi-afghan-translator.html  Top Google result for ""Iraqi translators get visas""   Put a fraction as much effort into knowing what's actually happening as you do to spamming and vote manipulation and maybe people wouldn't be so annoyed with all you t_d posters.  Does the we have any honor left since we elected this honorless cur? No, refugees who worked for the US military. See the link I posted to the other idiot who doesn't know what he's talking about. The Allies Protection Act is not about economic opportunity. It's about moving people somewhere safer because they're targets for retribution after helping the US military.  Since he's the president, by long chain of transitive closure, yes it's his fault. It's Americas fault. He's the leader of America. As top dog, he's responsible now. He should not be President if he doesn't want to be responsible  Exhibit B: Ironically unconstitutional supporting Republican First of all, I'm sorry that happened to you and your home. We're glad to have you here.      And that's the reason why the ban is wrong. America has always been a nation built by immigrants. Everyone is welcomed. If you break our laws, there are consequences. Ideology wrecked lebanon. I dont defend any religion because they are all barbaric when taken too seriously, but a spade is a spade.   Extremism in all forms is the issue and now you're cheering for it in your new home. Do you really not see the irony in supporting christian zealots after muslim zealots ruined your last home?  You come from Lebanon and want extended bans? Are you kidding me, aren't you thankful to have found refuge, and do you want to risk being sent back if Lebanon is part of the next list? You should feel more targeted than anyone mate, you'll feel stupid if and when they send you back for the reasons you just justified Wait, but aren't you also an English professor AND a student AND living in Lebanon at the same time, too?   Your ignorance shows in many ways u only see this through your eyes and that's why trump has so much influence over you. Push away the pain for a moment and look at it from all sides I have a story worse then yours but I am glad Canada gave my family the chances they needed but not what they wanted. You are ignorant and the sooner you open your eyes to this world the better you are exactly the type of victim trump wants to persuade and that's why you support him but you are forgetting the most important parts. You mean the average German who voted in the nazi party? Oh ok then, the average German had nothing to do with it at all then I guess It's like blaming all Muslims for the acts of a few killers... If they supported the Nazis. Yes they were kids as bad. Just like you.  Considering 75% of Iraq is Shiia, and Saddam's Sunni government pretty much tortured and extorted people into going to war with Iran, and the Shiias there tried to assassinate Saddam's son and have a revolution in '91, is it really that hard to believe? >How things have changed      That's what happens when you invade a country and install a dangerous puppet regime of opposing sect. In case you weren't paying attention, Iranian influence is directly responsible for the current mess in the region:  * Iran's Shia policies inflame sectarianism throughout the region, and this is directly responsible for the violence in Yemen as Iran is willing to give any Shia entity weapons to harm Sunnis. This has created tensions within Muslim nations as Sunnis worry about the possibility of their Shia minority turning into militants. Iran's foreign policies have created intense mistrust within the Muslim world.  * Iran backed Assad when he was dealing with Sunni protests, giving him the confidence to vow that he would not compromise to any of their demands (which primarily revolved around elections). Without Iranian assurances of support, Assad might have been more willing to negotiate- and avoid the hardline behavior that led directly to a civil war.  * If Iran hadn't encouraged the Iraqi Shia to pursue domination of Iraq, they wouldn't have alienated the Sunnis and Kurds. It weakened the Iraqi military to the point that when ISIS surged into northern Iraq, the Sunnis were apathetic as to why they should fight on behalf of a government who marginalized them, the Kurds were about to announce a secession referendum (until the US talked them out of it), and the Shia political parties had filled the iraqi military with soldiers and officers whose only qualifications was often that they were related to important Shia politicians..  > They could simply... I don't know, pay the translator? Money?  Do you think they've been paying them in beans?  Those people risked their lives not for the dollars due on payday, but because we as a country promised we had their back.  Now that we demonstrate that we in truth do not have their back and that an American promise is a pile of dookey then we should be expecting a much more difficult time finding help going forward. There's a level of smart arse among Trump supporters who lionise wheeling and dealing. They assume you can scam your way into wealth.  They think they are good because they fucked over someone. The reality is that reliability makes profits.  Who wants to deal with a shark? Not me, I like my business partners to be reliable and repeatable. Not mercurial and dangerous. Any sort of short term profit is lost due to the fact you are gambling.  Hah we fucked over all those Iraqi engineers and doctors who wanted to work post independence! Aren't we smart? Wait how come Al Sadr has better healthcare and more reliable electricity than we do...   It is that same mentality.  To me it sounds like Trump is 'washing his hands' of back deals with foreign governments like that (to some extent, we'll see what happens in the future).   But that still doesn't respond to your logic, how can Trump be held responsible for the actions of his predecessors ? It's his fault for taking over a problem that Obama created? How does that make sense? You are exactly right \thread LOL K  Oh wait...you really believe this? You'd think those same translators would have had an issue with all the things the US has done before, but it didn't make a difference.  There is a reason a win/win is thought of as a good thing. Because countries have continuity. Otherwise some country could kill a thousand Americans, change their President, and then say ""what the fuck are you mad at, it wasn't us, it was the previous administration that killed Americans."" It makes sense because countries have continuity. It's not like the US is reborn as a brand new country every election......  > It's his fault for taking over a problem that Obama created? How does that make sense?  Obama invaded Iraq after 9/11? If the man did not want to be responsible for the duties of the office then he fucking well should not have run for the job. Honest question:  How do you feel about Trump de facto banning people living in the US legally?  Should the POTUS have the power to override existing written law?  Additionally, how do you feel about the EU offering much better incentives to scientists involved in STEM fields?  How do you think he'll overcome the intentional brain drain of hobbling advances in technology?    So your logic here is to assume what I think, and then proceed to agree with the unconstitutionality of Trump's actionswhile claiming to be pro-constitution?  Exhibit C: Alt righty. Because electing Trump is the way to reign in the powers of the president?  Your arrogance is astounding. GWB is a Republican You must have misinterpreted what I said. I said you were forced to flee your homeland due to extremism and now you're in your new home and cheering on it's own form of extremism. The bill was drafted by a hardcore christian zealot who owns a xenophobic ""news"" website that caters to the alt right and christian fundamentalists.   You're not going to tell me anything new by pointing out how horrible some people are. But if that were true and nobody from those countries are compatible with western ideals then we would have no immigrants from those countries. You yourself are proof not everybody is a monster that comes from muslim countries, do you think you're incompatible with western ideology? You seem to be fitting in just fine arguing online with people you will never meet about things you or I can never really change.  Do I think we should open a flood gate? Hell no. We have checks and systems in place and have some of the strictest refugee requirements already. But blanket banning several countries and making the wording vague so its open to the kind of abuse where the very man that drafted the bill (breitbart's CEO Steve Bannon) told enforcement agencies to also deny green card holders, is nothing but the other side of the same coin that ruined your country.  And that is *exactly* what the far-right would've said about you, coming from Lebanon.  ""Do you really think this is about Christians vs Muslims? I honestly don't know what to say to that, it's such a narrow view of what is happening. Christianity has done a lot of good in the world regardless, so has Islam.  One of the five pillars of the Islamic faith is charity, but I don't see Saudi or any wealthy gulf countries taking in their Islamic brothers. Both religions have done good, and both have also done bad. If even one refugee allowed in is an extremist, it is too many. I'm all for sending money and relief to refugees in Lebanon and neighboring countries, that's fine. But to import people across the world who have a culture incompatible with our civilization is an enormous mistake. They don't value human life and equal rights like we do in the West, live in any Muslim majority country outside of resort hotels and you will see what I mean when I say these people are not the same.""  So why was it okay for you to come, but not for them? These bans don't just affect Muslims, they affect *everyone* from affected countries. What if Trump decided Lebanon had been, in your own words, ""wrecked"" by Muslims and banned all Lebanese from coming into the country? How is that different than this, and why don't you want these people to have the same opportunities you were afforded? Plenty of people from these countries feel the same way you do, plenty of them have families that were raped and murdered, plenty of them don't approve of the way their countries are run; what makes you different from them? You left sooner?  Not that I don't want you here, I don't agree with what you're saying. I'm just saying your argument could be used against *your* immigration here just as easily. They arrested a 5 year old citizen at dulles because of this ban. Brown people aren't safe.  Ah, so lucky circumstances, you get to stay. Pretty sure dual citizens are also barred from the US. So if you still have your Lebanese citizenship or if you came from Iran which doesn't let your forfeit it, you'd be fucked. Refugees aren't the only group encountering immigration issues. Also you sound a whole fucking lot like a refugee, considering you escaped from violence to come to the US  I checked:  >I came to the USA to escape from violent Islam  You. Fucking. Prick. You're not from here. Get out.  >  who is responsible for the current regime in Iran?   the current regime in Iran?  I mean we didn't help with overthrowing their PM but radical clerics have been in control for a while now The Shah, for not neutralizing the clerics early on in his reign, and letting Khomeini live in exile rather than executing him.  Thank you, it seems logic is downvoted heavily in this sub Except that is exactly what the US does to the rest of the world I understand your point and it's sound. My view right now though is Trump essentially cutting ties with the ME and setting precedent to no longer be associated with their governments.   I'm interested in your thoughts though, this is just my interpretation  That's still not Trumps fault. First off didn't Obama blame all his problems on Bush? Let me get this straight. Your argument is that Obama did absolutely nothing over the past 8 years? Then why did Obama blame bush? What makes them radical? The problem is that thousands of Iraqis worked for US military over a decade, at grave risk to themselves and their families. Other Iraqis consider them traitors for working with the enemy, and will kill them when they can.  To protect them, the US offered asylum in exchange for cooperation. But now Trump says tough shit, you can't come here, we don't give a fuck if you get killed for helping us.  Aside from the fundamental unfairness of this situation, it guarantees that no foreigner will ever cooperate with the US again, because they know the US is dishonest and doesn't keep its word. This harms the effectiveness of US military and US diplomacy.  And it's fucking pointless because it doesn't do a damn thing to benefit America. These Iraqis have already been subject to ""extreme vetting"" and they've proven their loyalty to America by staking their own lives and those of their families on it. They've passed tests that most Americans never pass in their lifetimes. These people are assets, they're not threats to America. But Trump is fucking them up. [removed] Not at all.  But he didn't create the problem. Because Bush invaded Iraq, just as his father did?  What the fuck is your issue with accepting the fact that you won?  If it helps you to blame Obummer for everything then carry on.  It does NOT address the issue that the United States of America gave its word to protect these people that were risking their lives (and that of their families!) and now Donald Trump is breaking that promise.  America owes a debt and Trump is telling the debt holder to go piss up a rope.  That is going to hurt our country greatly the next time we need local assistance. Green card holders were rejected an citizens were arrested for trying to enter the US. Trump backpedaled and now allowed green card holders in, but before, their green cards were temporarily revoked for no reason The word alien includes green card holder guy  So, basically, I got mine, fuck all those other people in the same situation I was in, they don't deserve the chances I got.  Such a hypocrite. You're a total hypocrite, like others have said here. On top of that, you may hold a naturalization certificate attesting to your citizenship, but you lack American values - those are built on immigrants, by immigrants, for immigrants. In fact, we're a country of immigrants.  Go read what the Statue of Liberty says, for example. Thank you and good bye. So you happened to leave in a time with no ban, but fuck the people that want to leave when there is a ban?  Do you hate yourself also? I don't understand the hypocrisy.  Isn't that the American way though for foreign policy? We claim to offer help, do so, then repeal it years later when it is convenient? Hasn't this ban been partially repealed and many Iraqi agents are being allowed travel as usual? So why was it ok for Obama to blame Bush but all of Obamas faults are Trumps faults?   Logic, you don't have it > It's Americas fault. He's the leader of America. As top dog, he's responsible now. He should not be President if he doesn't want to be responsible   The comment chain you jumped in on. You don't seem to even know what you're talking about   Yes. And I would add that this retraction was because of the rulings the superior court have stated against the unconstitutionality of parts of the Executive's orders, hence their ""rollback"". Not that I've heard of. The only change I know from the initial announcement is that green card holders are no longer banned, but might be admitted on a case by case basis. It's not okay for Obama to do that, neither is it for Trump. The leader of your country needs to be held acountable no matter what political party they say they align with. This shouldn't be an argument where you just throw in why is it okay for Obama to say that because it's not, Obama did good things and bad things, so far president Trump has done some good things that have long term benefits and some things that are coming from a very bigoted narrow minded point of view. It's okay to criticize the bad things your leader does as well as recognize the good things they are doing.   [removed] How am I hurling insults at you. Your hypocrisy is showing whether you think it's an insult or not. Yes, I know what bad government mixed with religion can do. I left Iran for the same reason. But I don't for a second hope to close the doors on the people who didn't get the chance to leave before and are trying now.  You got what you wanted when you left, and now you don't seem to give a shit about anyone else that is in the same situation that you used to be. So you either lack empathy, or you're just oblivious to the hypocrisy.   You're not ""protecting your new countrymen"", this ban is not going to have any terrorism preventing effects. You're only patting yourself on the back now that you're out and betraying everyone else who's still stuck in a shit situation.

"11",10,"5r7xyu","2017-01-31","> It is understood that the Prince wrote the speech a week ago, before Mr Trump announced his travel ban      This seems to be an important line. Takes the hot-button sensationalism out of it.      Edit: I thought I'd chosen politically neutral language, but people have created various shadowy agendas for me. I feel empowered and nefarious! My only goal was to point out that the Telegraph wished to harvest your clicks with what I'm sure it hoped would appear to be, in this news cycle, royal reaction to the travel ban, when further reading reveals this may not be the case. In the interests of transparency, my agenda for the remainder of the afternoon is to make a truly fantastic chili.      Edit 2: *Reddit is so weird [here is my damn chili recipe](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5r7xyu/prince_charles_warns_horrific_lessons_of_ww2_are/dd5umfw/).* We're also forgetting the lessons of the Great Depression.  Fascism arose from industrialists that refused to pay a living wage, etc.   >Perhaps the most memorable line of the speech came when Roosevelt described forces which he labeled ""the old enemies of peace: business and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering."" He went on to claim that these forces were united against his candidacy; that **""They are unanimous in their hate for me  and I welcome their hatred.""**  [FDR's 1936 Madison Square Garden speech transcript](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=15219) Got it. Never invade Russia in winter alright. How did we end up in a world where Charles is talking sense? Is one of the lessons ""If you don't want nazis, don't make a weimar""? Because the nazis didn't spring up from the earth. To say we learned any lesson from ww2 is insane. The holocaust was not the last genocide, its not even the last in europe. Cambodia, Rwanda, yugoslavia and the great leap forward happened after the holocaust. I'm jewish and i have family that survived the holocaust but lets not kid ourselves into thinking genocide has not happened since.  I think it's worse than that: I think we are overburdened by them.  In the past if a government got out of hand and started murdering its own citizens, you could rightfully compare the genocide to the Nazis.  But now you don't see that. You see people compared to Nazis all the time for the stupidest things. I was accused of being a Nazi by a friend when I said that white people visit national parks far more than people of other races, even adjusted for income. I didn't get a chance to specify that I thought that this was due to where people live, or who people hang out with (You're more likely to go to national parks if your friends go, for instance). No. Before I could go into details, I was labeled a Nazi.  Really? Without killing a single person, calling for the deaths of a single person, or even claiming that X race is better than Y race, I was called a Nazi for no other reason than stating a fact that different people engage in different activities. Nevermind the fact that I worked with adults with mental disabilities, all from various races and walks of life. The term 'Nazi' lost a little more weight to me.   We remember the horrific lessons of WWII because rest assured, society will not let us forget these tragic years. We know it so well in fact that the lessons have become background noise, and are becoming alarmingly easy to ignore.  In danger of being forgotten? There's more consciousness about the Holocaust now that at any point in history:  > ""Between the end of the war and the 1960s, as anyone who has lived through those years can testify, the Holocaust made scarcely any appearance in American public discourse, and hardly more in Jewish public discourse"" - Peter Novick, The Holocaust in American Life  Read the first four paragraphs of [*Baron, L. ""The Holocaust and American Public Memory, 1945-1960."" Holocaust and Genocide Studies, vol. 17 no. 1, 2003, pp. 62-88.*](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/43122) for a good scholarly overview.  We are well past awareness, well past saturation, to the point where it's lost much of its significance through being wielded indiscriminately as a rhetorical club to bludgeon people you disagree with. Those who don't want the lessons to be forgotten would do well not to trivialize them through overuse.  There are other lessons from that period that are in danger of being forgotten, lessons far less palatable to the monied elites and trust-fund activists standing on their soapboxes. Perhaps that's why they're in danger of being forgotten. I recommend [*The Origins of Totalitarianism*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origins_of_Totalitarianism) by Hannah Arendt, which discusses not only the Holocaust but also imperialism, internationalism, financialisation, elitism, and Soviet totalitarianism. Those lessons were already forgotten a couple of years after WW2 ended, when the west and soviets almost started WW3. Nuclear weapons and their destructive power is the only thing that has kept the peace among industrial nations.  edit: and it hasn't even really kept the peace that well, people are still dying in proxy wars and political maneuvering, just not at the same scale and in direct conflict between nations So what is *the lesson* of ww2?  Neocons say it's that no tyrants can be appeased. If we don't take out Saddam/Assad/Gaddaffi/Khomeini **now**, they are gonna invade the world next. Their policy was tried and ended in disaster.  Is the lesson that you have to abhor antisemitism? Or that you always have to accept refugees? The two are obviously contradictory, because most muslim refugees have antisemitic attitudes.   Or is the lesson the one that Zygmunt Baumann tried to push, that modern bureaucracy and modernism in general alienates the people, so that atrocities can happen through de-personalization? Then certainly, the lesson of WW2 can't be that human rights must always be followed, for human rights as is today is an extremely technical and legalistic construct.  Or is the lesson that democracy must be put above everything? Or is the lesson that international cooperation must always happen? These two are contradictory as well; as most states aren't democratic, and won't cooperate unless we respect their nondemocratic government.  So what the hell *is* the lesson really?  The governments have forgotten and people are responding accordingly. Let me guess Trump is literally worse than Hitler. Yeah like the vanity of trying to appease a tyrant.  When WW2 commenced, the National Rifle Association asked it's membership for donations of weapons, which were then given to the disarmed UK population...  Did Prince Charles mention that? No.  https://www.nraila.org/articles/19990716/lost-battles-lost-rights-by-david-kope  From the link:  World War II  After the fall of France and the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940, Britain found itself short of arms for island defense. The Home Guard was forced to drill with canes, umbrellas, spears, pikes, and clubs. When citizens could find a gun, it was generally a sporting shotgun  ill suited for military use because of its short range and bulky ammunition.   Prime Minister Winston Churchill inspecting a No. 4 Enfield which the British adopted after Dunkirk, because the rifle could be mass produced.   British government advertisements in American newspapers and in magazines such as The American Rifleman begged Americans to ""Send A Gun to Defend a British HomeBritish civilians, faced with threat of invasion. desperately need arms for the defense of their homes."" The ads pleaded for ""Pistols, Rifles, Revolvers, Shotguns and Binoculars from American civilians who wish to answer the call and aid in defense of British homes.""  Pro-Allied organizations in the United States collected weapons; the National Rifle Association shipped 7,000 guns to Britain. Britain also purchased surplus World War I Enfield rifles from America's Department of War.      Prime Minister Winston Churchill's book Their Finest Hour details the arrival of shipments of .300 caliber rifles and .75 caliber artillery pieces from the U.S. government in July 1940. Churchill personally supervised the deliveries to ensure that they were sent on fast ships and distributed first to Home Guard members in coastal zones. Churchill thought that the American donations were ""entirely on a different level from anything we have transported across the Atlantic except for the Canadian division itself."" Churchill warned his First Lord that ""the loss of these rifles and field-guns would be a disaster of the first order.""  ""When the ships from America approached our shores with their priceless arms special trains were waiting in all the ports to receive their cargoes,"" Churchill recalled. ""The Home Guard in every county, in every town, in every village, sat up all through the night to receive them.... By the end of July we were an armed nation.... a lot of our men and some women had weapons in their hands.""   At his New York City shop, Maj. Anthony Fiala (l.), of the American Committee For Defense of British Homes, crates .45-70 trapdoor carbines, as chairman Cutting watches. Committee efforts led to more than 25,000 guns and two million rounds of ammunition being sent to defend Britain against Nazi invasion.   Before the war, British authorities had refused to allow domestic manufacture of the Thompson submachine gun because it was ""a gangster gun."" When the war broke out, large numbers of American-made Thompsons were shipped to Britain, where they were dubbed ""Tommy guns.""  As World War II ended, the British government did what it could to prevent the men who had risked their lives in defense of freedom and Britain from holding onto guns acquired during the war. Troop ships returning to England were searched for souvenir or captured rifles, and men caught attempting to bring firearms home were punished. Guns that had been donated by American civilians were collected from the Home Guard and destroyed by the British government.  And yet, large quantities of firearms slipped into Britain, where many of them remain to this today in attics and under floor boards. At least some British gun owners, like their counterparts in today's gun-confiscating jurisdictions such as New Jersey and New York City, were beginning to conclude that their government did not trust them, and that their government could not be trusted to deal with them fairly.  Live in Alabama, recently found out that local high school history classes don't talk about WWII anywhere near as much as when I was there (less than 10 years ago). Asked my buddy's little sister a few questions about the war. She could only name Germany as an Axis power, couldn't name Mussolini, had never heard of Himmler or Goerring, and thought I was making a sex joke when I brought up the Battle of the Bulge... This guy shouldn't be giving anybody advice. German/English inbred chump. I would say they are being trivialized, not forgotten. When everyone you don't like is a 'goose-stepping, jack-booted Nazi' you start to lose sight of actual, legitimate Jew/Gypsy/Homosexual/Slavic gassing Nazis. The weirdos online posting pepe's don't pose the risk that Nazi's busting in windows on Kristallnacht did. Don't take this as normalizing online neo-nazi behavior, but let's be real here. Admittedly my British English isn't the most proficient but I believe, ""He has raised these issues over many years and is not seeking to directly link them to anybody who is currently the focus of attention."" roughly translates to, ""if you think this was directed at President Trump, you'd be correct."" Did not read article. Would just like to comment. In-bred globalist elite.  This guy has no clue about ww2 danger and how the situation has completely evolved.  Your highness, let's go out of your castle before trying to give moral lessons to people.  I'm not sure he's aware of his nation laws shift and the brexit.    Prince Charles believes magic water cures diseases. He must have forgotten his HS chemistry and biology lessons long ago.  Like importing Nazism to Europe by inviting all the modern Nazis from the ME? Like nukes.  Are we **supposed** to use them? Early war-time results suggest: yes! Use the nukes. This is the kind of stuff we will keep hearing while the globalists continue to not get their way. Gotta keep up that daily fear mongering quota!! Who let the princess out? You mean allowing Germany to rise up again? Don't worry, they are tanking themselves. Same crap that has been popping up for days.  If we don't open our borders to the third world hoards, we're Nazis. But this isn't a Muslim ban. Some of the biggest Muslim countries are excluded  Prince Charles, only a person of relevance because he is born to royalty, more famous for his dead wife than for anything he ever did that was noteworthy except diddling Camilla.     Just want everyone to remember the source of this speaker. If we think Trump is Hitler we've obviously forgotten them already.  We've also forgotten it was fashionable for Weimar intellectuals to say they were living in a fascist state.  Boy, were they in for a rude awakening when the real fascists showed up Somebody stick some haggis in that pie hole, he's giving me a headache. If we want to remember history, let's recall what a dominating elitist was Britannia when the sun never set on its piratical, double dealing abomination of empire.   It was their oppressive tactics that demanded that the colonists kick their asses. So who put this turd in the punchbowl? Why are we listening to The Royals? >reptilian warns about ""lessons of war being forgotten""  wew Now the question remains which Royal is the secret Nazi? My bet is on Harry. The lad has form... The lessons have to be repeated. Once the lesson passes from memory to history people feel immune to the same dangers their great grandparents faced. Never get involved in a land war in Asia? Fixed fortifications are monuments to the stupidity of man? What lessons is he referring to? Were the lessons of WW2 even learned to begin with? He's still alive? Hard to forget something you never studied. Does anyone really care about what a man who moaned about being a Tampon thinks? NO.  He said it so it must be true And what was the ridiculous and misleading/oversimplified lesson?  Nationalism is bad??? lol, grow up Charlie Didnt prince charles arrange for the murder of his ex wife?  Why do they bring this up only in relation to Trump?  We don't need to forget WW2 when it comes to Islam, too.  If you view Islam not as a religion but as a political affiliation like, say, Nazis then the lesson from WW2 that people like the Nazi's can only do evil when regular good people stand by and watch should apply to Muslims who are not ""extremists"".  Specifically:  All muslims should stand up against extremism.  If they don't, which they aren't, then they are just as guilty as the German citizen's of WW2 who didn't stand up to the Nazis.  Why am I the only one who sees this?  Call me an islamaphobe, if you want.  Doesn't detract from my point. The danger was thinking anyone with the will to power ever gave a damn about the lessons of WW2.  That boat sailed long again. They are already forgotten our education system sucks in America you have kids who can't even name the axis powers let alone the social atmosphere which allowed hitler to rise and *then* be able to deduce a similar atmosphere exists in Europe and America? We've already missed that boat that's exactly why the alternative right can exist in the first place.  http://www.newsweek.com/how-ignorant-are-americans-66053  like abolishing the 2nd amendment in fear of a tyrannical government that turns on its people? like those lessons? Wait until Trump rounds up all the Muslims and gasses them to death.  Then Republicans will be sorry. Are we really having Godwin's Law here?  europe is afraid that if they become even slightly less than extremely liberal and open-border that they will all resort to killing each other  I think you can be rational about immigration and not have ww3 - this current path of europe is more dangerous, because it means governments are ineffectual and sweeping things under the rug, which leads to blowback The lessons of WW2 and the Great Depression were forgotten here many years ago by most people, and that is why things have gone the way they have. For two generations now people have been mollycoddling their kids for the most part, and that's led to a severe skew in perspective over how bad it can be or is.  That has led to apathy, and from that apathy, we end where we are now.  History repeats when people forget it. The Jews weren't known for committing mass shootings and bombings. Completely different situations. The sad thing is, it's a lot easier to avoid the mistakes of the past when they're literally remembered by many. The WW2-era population is dwindling, so a lot more effort is desperately needed to teach the new generations. I'm pretty sure they're in danger of being remembered in explicit detail.  A jewish guy critiquing immigration bans.. Meanwhile, in Israel.. Says the guy who lives in manors built with stolen money and serf labor. Give your ill gotten money to the poor than I'll care what you say. I have no use for any royals. keep your goofy nose in your business ""prince"" Well WW2 is why the UN was invented, and Trump has turned his back on it, so, yes, that is the definition of forgetting the lessons of WW2. Prince Charles is trivializing the horrific lessons of WW2 by saying that. Actually credit where it's due, he's not too far off the truth - **since importing a fascist Islamic culture into Europe, the occurance of anti-semetic hate crimes has increased exponentially.** 'Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it'. George Santayana Is this the same place that can't figure out where the recent rise in anti-semitism is coming from? ""Dulce bellum inexpertis"" ""war is sweet to those who have never experienced it""  I played a lot of total war.    You mean the lesson to stop getting engaged in foreign wars?  Indeed.  Could have avoided the enormous wealth transfer called ""The Cold War"" AND not be dealing with refugees either!  I say we remind Israel about not committing genocide since they seem to be actively engaged in it but otherwise everyone mind their own business. We're also in danger of relearning them. This is so idiotic. I can't fathom that people really think that Trump is going to start a fucking genocide. It's insane that people would dare to trivialize the physical suffering and deaths of millions of people by comparing it to Donald Trump. It's horrifying.  They aren't in danger of being forgotten, they're in danger of being ignored by people in power. There's a difference. I know this isn't the focus of the piece but the little section of quotes really make him come across well, I am not particularly interested in the royal family (though I'm not for removing them like some Brits) but that made me think he wouldn't be a bad person to add to my fantasy dinner party.  those who forget the past are damned to repeat it I will say this, mainland europe is best in a union - if western europe totally fragments into 30 isolated countries, then they will undoubtedly face struggles in a global world, and another kind of forced union may occur  tho I think the UK is different enough from mainland europe that it can be its own union and be peaceful, maybe aligning more with america and more west  as far as america goes, I have absolutely no concern - america is already unionized, and americans dont have the will or desire to conquest - americans are more about business and will create treaties and states, tho those treaties may not always be 100% honored  america is more at risk of becoming very isolationist and booting people out, and actually shaving itself down History is always forgotten.  That's why we keep repeating it. War...war never changes. Who the fuck is this guy?  Repeated is the word he was looking for. He's old and out of touch! Why would we listen to old people about current events? Sad! bottom line is trump is new for everyone as far as surface goes you dont know what hell do what hell inact or support where he actually stands how much is real or bullshit. that scares people what they cant put in a neat little box what they cant label scares them so they fight nothing and scream and shout until it goes away. Sanders or trump you would have been afraid because change is scary they are merley coming from opposite ends. take a deep breath see what happens and prepare for the plates of your country to finally shift what does everyone think about these riots? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcsCBn64O5Y it's quite scary. We are in many ways repeating the lessons of World War 1 and 2.   'Attack on one is an attack on all' type security pact like NATO, Israel, and Pacific Asian security alliances; And it's almost the same geography considering the world wars were based primarily in the European and Pacific Asian continents. Islam is now the hot topic of religious militancy and persecutions. Multiple nations are attempting to build up their territorial and sovereign influences; like Russia on E. Ukraine & Syria, China with its SCS claims, Iran bolstering it's military and posture with the Syrian war and naval posturing in the Gulf which lead to the kidnapping of a dozen US sailors, and Turkey with its sovereign posturing in the Syrian War as well as re-organization of the government after the coupe.  We sure are living in a dangerously time. Two minutes to Midnight. And we can't stop sharing pictures of kittens and puppies.  I doubt it. This subject is constantly discussed online, adapted into films, and written down into books. WW2 and the Holocaust are still very much in the public conscious. A bat-eared, chinless wonder!  They are already forgotten.  As my friends say:   War is terrible!  But the sound is amazing! When are the royal family going to fuck off Prince Charles should get a job. That's funny. I don't remember the Jews cutting people's heads off and raping Europe like the muslims are doing. As someone who really loves history, I have said numerous times to my friends and family that there are so many parallels between now and the start of the British Revolution, American Revolution, and WWII it's uncanny. Nobody seems to want to listen to me, though, and usually say that I'm just getting into hysterics because I watch too many Occupy Democrats videos.  Prince Charles is not a leader. He is not elected. He is not a religious leader. He is certainly no commanding intellect. His claim to legitimacy is the result of a complete accident of birth. His mother understands the role of constitutional monarch. He does not. He is entitled to his opinion, but not to use his elevated social position to peddle it. He should do what he was born to do, namely open supermarkets and stand around in silly uniforms with feathers in his hat.  I am so fucking sick of the frothing hatred against Trump right now. Make no mistake, I think many of his approaches are dumb, but people are acting like previous presidents were shining paragons of morality.    My own country (UK) petitioning to disallow a visit is absurd. Why wasn't Obama campaigned against for some of the awful things he allow to happen.  Ridiculous. Fuck that homeopathy peddling cunt.  Fucking 9/11 is already forgotten. WWII was out the door when Duran Duran met at school. sometimes you can see where things are going before they happen. Also, Trump did say he would do something like this way before he was elected. Pics or it didn't happen on the chili.  Also, recipe plz Could you share with me your chili recipe? I'm a big chili fan. It's not like Trump's Muslim ban came out of nowhere. He explicitly laid it out as part of his plans.  Hit me up with that chili, fam! Chili, huh? The CO2 emissions don't bother you? Probably a climate change denier.  YES! CHILI RECIPE! I HOPE IT WAS GOOD.  ^^^sorry ^^^for ^^^yelling > before Mr Trump announced his travel ban  And after Trump had been elected President. The 2nd video of him talking about it was recorded Dec 19th according to the video. So yeah, well before the the travel ban.   Too bad Trump has been talking about this nonsense since before he was elected. He's also very much pro-torture which is medieval level shit.  The mental gymnastics people go through to validate their opinion is ridiculous.   It's not just the one man who is portrayed as Hitler right now. It's about all the people (if you can still call them that) who voted for him and support 'making america great again'. Trump is a fascist and I don't use that word lightly. Drives it home in my opinion. Now it's like ""see, this is exactly the type of shit I was talking about"" Good luck with the chili He most likely said this regarding Europe and the rise of Nationalism.  Of course this is mostly the fault of those in charge and the globalist. A rising wealth inequality. Bad jobs and stagnant growth. Large increase in non ingenious population. Constant war. Lack of personal security, ie terrorist attacks and increased crime. Censorship of information.  Of course this is going to lead to a counter and rise of nationalism. There is no country in world history where this wouldn't be the case. It's almost like a logic formula.  Just like higher unemployment leads to more unrest.     In response to your edit:  What are you putting in your chili?  Best of luck on your chili quest! I am on a similar adventure for the day, involving soup. I liked your comment and think it is well worded. How was the chilli? Would you be willing to share your recipe? We seriously need more people like you in the world- more people who can see past the click bait  I'm dumbfounded as to why people don't ""listen"" to speeches like this. The parallels are quite uncanny.  Hello America? Are you in there? /knocksondoor     HELLO?!?!  If you're in there someone is destroying all your shit, like your international credibility and you're ability to defend your constitution...   HELLO?!?! America??  /leaves Germany's depression too. After WWI people didn't have enough money, were fucking angry, and didn't have an education.   When you have millions of your country men that are uneducated they're easily manipulated.  40% of the US doesn't believe in evolution, for example.  They're not stupid.  They're just illiterate. Isn't it odd how we're so eager to label people as fascists, as if they just manifest out of thin air. We just talk about how these people exist and are the enemy. But hardly anyone ever talks about *why* they exist, what drives them to believing this is the solution? Nobody is born evil, there are individuals who seem drawn towards horrible things, but on a societal level there are always deeper reasons, yet this is never addressed. All I've seen for the past week is how Trump is literally Hitler and anyone right of centre is literally a Nazi. It's a massivly complex issue that can't be resolved by screeching 'fascist' at everyone. Trump is the tip of the iceberg, I can't even get angry about him. It goes so far beyond him. Nobody has forgotten anything.   Bannon is on the record as wanting to destroy America. What better way than by starting another Great Depression? Worked for the Mongols. Both Napoleon and Hitler invaded Russia in the Summer. Maybe you're supposed to start in the Winter so when you run out of supplies it's the summer? I know that he is (was?) disliked compared with the rest of the UK royals, but I am not familiar enough with his past to understand why.   Is he just disliked because of his divorce with Diana? Or was there something else he did/said?  He does quite often make sense he was ridiculed for speaking up on the environment. I will always listen to what he has to say even if I dont always agree with him. When Trump sets the bar, everyone starts to make sense. The same way we wound up in a world where #Kanye2020 is America's greatest hope for peace and prosperity.  Don't strip the losing nation of everything it has, building resentment against those who took it from them. I'm sure hitler would have had 0 power had they never used the treaty of Versailles, heck he might not have even been as tyrannical as he was. [""It must never happen again.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqf3hlYSBI&feature=youtu.be#t=00m31s) Try to stick to primary sources as much as possible.  1.

Another poster recommended [Rise and Fall of the Third Reich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rise_and_Fall_of_the_Third_Reich#Criticism). This is a book that you read not because it is a particularly accurate account but because lots of other people have read it and you want to understand where they're coming from. Unlike the others I mentioned, this one was written by an American journalist with no firsthand experience. Also, it's 1250 pages... Verdict: save this one for last. World At War is fantastic  As someone who has lived long enough to see 4 presidents and multiple election cycles, the only two things you can bet is: (a) roughly half the population will be unhappy and (b) comparisons to Hitler will be made.  The Hitler comparison tactic has become so expected that it has really lost all bite. Fortunately you have a solid enough brain in your head to want to ask the question ""what is the comparison?"" Anybody can compare two things, but as your research will show you, there isn't much of a conversation at all.   Comparing someone to Hitler isn't the beginning of dialogue, debate, or critical thinking, it is the end of the conversation. It's a lazy tactic, and unless the person is using specific information to draw the comparison, not worth paying any mind.   Trump is no where near Hitler's level of oration, indoctrination and resolve, unfortunately. Umberto Eco (famous novelist) was a child in fascist Italy in the 1940s and later in 1995 wrote an essay analyzing his experience of Mussolini's fascism and trying to decipher the hallmarks of ""ur-fascism"" (i.e. fascism in general, apart from its particular incarnation in any one nation). [Here's a link to it.](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/) It's not a direct answer to your question but still a relevant one: I'd recommend it as a quick and informative read. You need better, more intelligent friends. This happens on Reddit all the time. I've had people suggest racism for pointing out that the migrants in Europe are trying to go to the countries with the best welfare benefits. Just a pure fact. this sounds like a very American-like thing. No one outside of the internet calls people a nazi where I live. And Prince Charles also isn't American ;) I remember when I was at university, ""Holocaust Remembrance Week"" overlapped with the Rwandan Genocide in 1994. Came here to say something like this, but you put it far better than I could have done. For example, the number of immigration discussions here in Europe that end in comparisons to Nazis, the Holocaust and WW2 is alarming. Upon further inquiry, it is often revealed that the persons resorting to these comparisons know shockingly little about our recent history and WW2 in particular.   The events of WW2 have basically become buzzwords for a lot of people to promote their own agendas and demonizing their opponents. These people should be ashamed of themselves and called out on their cheap bullshit every single time.  > In danger of being forgotten?  I think it's better to say ""in danger of being ignored.""  They're not forgotten, it's just that *so many people* are straight up ignoring the similarities. This really is the more nuanced, and thus, *best* answer to this topic.   People remember the Holocaust, Hitler, all that.   What people *don't remember* is how exactly things like that were allowed to happen.           Hitler didn't just seize power in a day, and start his systematic murders over night. Mein Kampf was published in 1925, and he began his populist rise about the same time.           I do not think comparisons of Trump to Hitler are out of line in any way whatsoever. We as a human race should be shutting this shit down at the *first fucking signs* of that kind of thing. And yet, here we are...again. The holocaust was not the only lesson to be learned from WWII. Fascism is not defined by the holocaust or what Germany did against the Jews. Much like Bane V Batman, Hitler merely adopted the darkness, Mussolini was born in it. He was the first fascist leader and he did not have much time for Hitler's treatment of the Jews. Indeed the word fascism comes from the Roman Fasces, the bound bundle of sticks and symbol of Roman power which Mussolini had an obsession with, and making Italy great again. People are obsessed with World War 2 and seem to think religious tolerance means cracking down on people's right to be sacrilegious or to merely dislike religion. There are a lot of people preaching freedom of religion while attacking all other freedoms that should be afforded to people within a nation. It's a mystery how these people think that they can convince everyone with that approach. By freedom of religion people often mean things such as imposing blasphemy laws and censorship of anything that makes religion look bad. People should have freedom of belief and freedom of religion within reason. Those should never trump freedom of speech or justify thought crime laws.  What the authoritarian left is doing on behalf of religion is counter productive and it should stop. I absolutely despise religion but as long as it keeps to itself there's no problem. When it starts to be imposed on us which is happening now ironically due to the left pandering to even the most ridiculous sensitivities of some religious people. For some reason they are absolutely obsessed with defending the honour of Muslims. They have created this delusional romanticised notion that Muslims are like little kids and we're some kind of a big bully. There's a difference between defending Muslims from bullets and defending them from words. Sadly, there's actually a propaganda campaign going on right now to equate the two. It has somehow been adopted by liberals who seem to have forgotten things such as the attempts to ban music, books, violent computer games and so on from conservatives. They have actually constructed a basic pseudo theory I would say based on the slippery slope fallacy that would justify all of those things and ironically would also justify outlawing Islam. These people are being hoodwinked. Many of them cannot remember the era where in ever act of violence the killer's musical preferences would be listed as if they were fundamentally important.  We don't like religion because it massively curtailed our liberties and was often behind a number of travesties of justice. It's conservative and we're just not going to like it. It's only in the last few decades that we've emancipated our selves from that and it's still raw. It's not that long ago we had outcry from the Christian establishment in our nation attempting to censor our ridicule of the religion. An establishment that has now become moderate and tolerant. Islam has not collectively progressed to this point yet and the so called progressives are telling us to be tolerant of Islamic intolerance! Why is it progress does not apply to Islam? It certainly seems to need it.  If the best argument is to reference a piece of history for shock value then I don't think Charles has an argument. If anything Trump is more in line with learning from World War II as he has spoken of prioritising support for refugees from particularly threatened minority groups.  History is really broad. If he wants to shock people Charles is an a common idiot reciting the most well known historical event in the west today like it means something. An instrument becomes blunt through overuse. He should use the Korean War. In this war the US gunned down refugees crossing the border to South Korea including women and children lest a single communist infiltrator be among them. This included machine gunning them down at bridges and strafing them with planes. It was covered up but eventually came out because veterans were having terrible psychological issues.  People really need a broader picture of history rather than cherry picking parts to try to make an argument from association with some event for shock value. What very, very few people understand in this day and age is *how you actually get to WW2.* That's the critical part.   But we all know it can happen, and many are understandably paranoid of any kind of precedence that could possibly *lead* to something like a world war. Especially when you consider that the next world war will potentially be apocalyptic.   The big concern here is whether or not people are taking peace for granted.   At the end of the day, there's really only one ingredient that is critical to have a general war in the modern age: nationalism. Nationalism is what made *both* world wars even possible, and it's what will make the *next* world war possible. If you don't have nationalism, you don't get world wars. the cold war wasnt a new war - it was really ww2 never ending  the soviet union was still creeping westward after ww2, and swallowed up eastern-germany and would have swallowed up the rest of western europe in its weakened post war state, but the US denied them  its always funny when people give credit to the soviets for liberating germany, when they wanted to turn germany into a soviet satellite state - hardly liberating It's simple really...that there can't be a World War 3. It worries me when people are so desensitized that they no longer realize how horrific war can be. Because if we are to wage another World War, many of us won't live through it. I for one, would probably die. We're good at killing each other, should probably avoid doing it a third time. There's no road map to success.  There really is no one lesson.  To try to boil down the second world war, and the clusterfucks it encompassed into one lesson is hopeless.  I'm only a layman when it comes to WWII history, but I have read extensively on it, and the whole war was a bunch of clusterfucks that happened all over the world.  You can draw lessons from any of them.  To pretend that WWII was a nicely packaged moral lesson is just too simplistic.  And frankly, you can't talk about WWII, without looking at WWI, and you can't look at WWI without looking at whole bunch of stuff that happened pre-WWI. > human rights as is today is an extremely technical and legalistic construct.  It's not very complicated or legalistic. It stems from the [first principle](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/): "" All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.""  Other rights that stem from this declaration of equality between all human beings:  ""All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law.""  ""Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion""  These are very important and simple principles that lead to an open and free society. The interpretation of those rights can generate legal disputes but the rights themselves are simple and common sense.  And if you want to know why these rights are important, here's from the preamble:  ""Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world,  Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people,  Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law,"" Don't let Germany get too powerful. Most of the 20th century was about unlearning the mistakes of unchecked nationalism, which had been building up during the previous century. World War 2 didn't just happen; neither did World War 1. Those events were the culmination of many years of worldwide societal growth - much of which is rooted in nationalism. To recognize what the threat from Fascism is [TL:DR it will abuse the freedoms of thought and speech afforded to it's supporters in liberal, open, tolerant societies to undermine the very nature of those societies. That it represents the most evil drives in humanity, that it leads directly to the horrors of industrialized murder.] & the only way it can be dealt with - by complete opposition including the use of force. That to destroy an ideology, you need to use total war on the entire organization -citizens included- until the system collapses.  Oh, and don't start a land war in central asia. There's lots of lessons. I'm sure you could list a few if you tried.   Edit: in the article, Prince Charles *does* use the plural when referring to these lessons. Well why was WWII started?  That would be a good place to look to understand the lessons it has to teach. Obviously it's reasons go back to WWI and beyond that. We need to look at and understand as much of history as we can. The UN and the age of globalism came to be due to direct responses to WWII. So it's good to understand and consider why we are here today and why things are the way they are. I haven't really answered anything here but maybe we can delve into some of the reasons for how we ended up at those events in history  The lesson is to accept Globalism and all globalistic values without so much as a whimper of protest. Be a good pawn, work 50 hours a day, and partake in the globalist entertainment sphere, rinse and repeat. I know right, the Saudi Arabian visit next week is bang out of order. The thing is, the 'goose-stepping, jack-booted Nazis"" didn't lead off with Kristallnacht and gassing. Then, as now, it would have been unthinkable. Instead, they eased into it over time. They started small, by nurturing and exploiting a sense of victimization to scapegoat a manufactured common enemy. The argument that people are making is that current events bear a resemblance to the events leading up to the Holocaust. I agree with you that the terms ""Nazi"" and ""Fascist"" have been trivialized, which is what makes it harder to recognize when it's actually happening.  Nazism is very specific, while Islam is as broad as any other religion. Comparing Nazism to Wahhabism is totally reasonable though. Many Muslims despise Wahhabism but they are powerless to put an end to it as Saudi Arabia, which promotes it, is protected by the United States. >  >  >  >  > Specifically: All muslims should stand up against extremism. If they don't, which they aren't, then they are just as guilty as the German citizen's of WW2 who didn't stand up to the Nazis.   Yeah, i'm sure all the muslims that die at the hands of ISIS and terror bombings in the middle east are just not standing up to the extremists...     you joke but idiots out there think that hes going to turn wallmart into death camps. Well, this is without sarcasm partly what worries those who raise the alarm when the country gets caught up in the drumbeat of nationalism.       It isn't like the National Socialist Party transformed Germany overnight, nor that people's personal liberties were turned upside down all at once, nor that there weren't people protesting it.      The temperature was turned up gradually, and those who were calling out for action were argued down: nobody was being killed, people were only suffering inconvenience, sometimes some sacrifices must be made for national security. Each time the rule of law was not upheld, a new standard was set.      It could be an overreaction, and God knows I hope it is. But overlooking it, or writing it off because, ""It's not that bad *yet*"" is precisely how it gets to be that bad. At which point nobody believs it is. Many Republicans are already speaking out against him, like John McCain.  Our Walmart FEMA camps are ready to accept the Lizard People.  Seriously, I went to one of the alleged FEMA camps.  All that was there, was a crack whore who needed money--and mediocre products at high prices I don't think you have the right image of European politics at all.  Half of Europe currently has right wing governments, many of them elected partly because of their anti-immigration policy. Like my country, Norway, the socialist, ultraliberal utopia? Currently has a right wing government deporting refugees, and taking in less new refugees than nearly every country in Europe, and half of the population backs it. I would say that's pretty far from ""extremely liberal and open-border"". We haven't even had a ""refugee-crisis"", and the usually liberal and leftist country of Norway is acting very right wing atm.   And I know we're not the only ones. It hasn't taken Europe long to overreact to the refugees. In a few years I expect most European countries to have right wing governments. Sadly, because of people's fear of immigrants, we're gonna have to live with all the other stupid shit that comes with the right, like tax cuts for businesses and the rich, tearing up already settled issues (in most of Europe) like abortion, privatization of health care, elder care, education, etc.   Honestly, I'm neutral when it comes to refugees and immigrants. I think both sides are wrong, and I have no idea what solution would work. But I think the left would be smart to ease up on their stance, because they will be losing more and more voters throughout Europe. They're handing over elections to the right, and therefore the control of the country, and I don't like it. I think it's time to bite the apple.  But they were known, that is to say scapegoated, as having been responsible for Germany's defeat in the First World War and the humiliation of Versailles. A greater evil, in the eyes of the German people, than some shootings.  They were largely blamed for the rise of Bolshevism in Russia and  Germany (which led to civil war after WWI). So the situations aren't that different, at least in perception. Actually they were but you're not supposed to know about it or talk about it.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionist_political_violence  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_religious_terrorism There were two UN's before WW2, a UN composed of Germany, Italy and Japan, and another UN composed of US, USSR, UK, Australia, Canada. I prefer the Russian proverb.  Dwell on the past and you'll lose an eye,  Forget the past and you'll lose both eyes. ""The Internet is an excellent source of information. All of it true.""  - Benjamin Franklin, probably.  The royal family has almost zero power. Yeah but all his shit headed supporters were saying that Trump wasn't going to deliver on his promises. He was just going to ""fix"" America and he just used radical fascist rhetoric to garner votes. Turns out that he actually is a fascist. Who'd have thought...     Edit: spelling Since when were we supposed to take him on his word? I find it ironic considering the driving factor of brexit was basically immigration.   Well it's not like persecution of Christians in the middle east is a new thing. It's been going on for centuries.  Well as the future Supreme Governor of the Church of England, it would seem a fitting agenda.  There is currently a genocide going on in Syria of Christians (Assyrians) and Yazidi who occupied Northern Iraq/Southern Syria.  A year ago people were clamoring for more specific help for victims of genocide, today they pretend like it is a political points for right wingers. So what? Religious tolerance is a worthwhile goal. Quit calling it an agenda and trying to make it seem like he's an ass for trying to get people not to kill each other.  It's almost like people are paying more attention to religious intolerance as religious intolerance is being pushed as foreign policy. And yet, Prince Charles has to keep warning them. Almost anyone commenting on this travel ban will have media coverage and that's not disproportionate.   This is a major thing because it's happening right in US soil. You are most probably referring to the coverage given by western media. Any serious media cares more about domestic issues than foreign issues. And christians being persecuted in Middle East is a foreign issue until we are talking about citizens of a western country.  A ban perceived to target a religion into your own country is a domestic issue. And limiting the entrance to green card holders is for many a personal issue as their relatives, friends or simply neighbors, are blocked at the airport just because they were unlucky enough to be outside the country when the order was signed.  He's previously said that he would be the defender of the faithS if he does become king. Historically, I believe it's always been the sovereigns role to be the defender of the faith.  I'm an atheist..but good in him. Pluralism FTW. So many requests. What a strange place.      This makes our favorite vegetable chili; when adding meat, just fry it between steps 1 and 2. Tonight I'm putting 1 lb ground turkey in.      * 1 onion, chopped * 2 cloves garlic, crushed * 1 tablespoon oil * 2 peppers, chopped * 3 tins beans (pink, kidney, black, pinto, whatever you got) * 1 large tin tomatoes * 2 tablespoons chili powder * 2 teaspoons cumin * 1 teaspoon oregano * 0.5 teaspoon salt      1. Fry onions and add garlic in oil until softened (about 5 mins).    2. Add peppers, fry for 2-4 mins until softened.    3. Drain beans, add to pot.    4. Add tomatoes, chili powder, cumin, oregano, and salt. 5. Bring to boil, then simmer for 15 mins or longer (ages is better). So? I remember people disagreeing the first time he mentioned it. The problem is that people only learn that the stove is hot by burning their own hands.  There are some kinds of knowledge you can't teach; you learn by experience.  Right now, the world is full of people who have never burned their hands, and so either don't believe the stove is hot, or don't believe that it even exists.    We're headed towards a generational crisis.  One occurs every 80 years or so, when the generation that weathered the previous crisis dies out.  In our case, the previous generational crisis was weathered by the WWII generation.  While America has endured problems in the intervening years, nothing has occurred on the scale of the great depression and WWII.    Trump, a Boomer, is the prime example of this problem.  He's a member of the most privileged generation of human beings to have ever existed.  His entire life he's been protected by an enormous, elaborate safety net - the established post-WWII international order - that his parents' generation built through bitter and bloody sacrifice.  His entire life, he's been able to fail again and again without consequence thanks to that safety net.   Now he's in charge of the safety net, but he doesn't seem to either believe in it, or doesn't think it's truly necessary.  He's using the same high risk high reward tactics that he's known his entire life - tactics enabled by other peoples' hard work - but whereas before the consequences of these risks were illusory, now they're frighteningly real.   We're going to have to endure a period of crisis to learn, collectively, what true instability feels like, and practice the kind of deep sacrifice that is needed to build and maintain a newly stable social order.  This crisis will be precipitated by Trump's arrogance.  God help us all.   You really want to see some historical smackdown, go look up William Jennings Bryan laying the smackdown on fascist President McKinley. Ive talked hardcore Christian conservatives into being hardcore liberal Christians using mostly his stump speeches.  Many people are saying we are re-living the 1980's and others would point to the 1920's. All of them seem to have forgotten the depression of the 1890's and how the robber barons basically installed a puppet to run the government on behalf of their corporations. This lead to Teddy Roosevelt and FDR in what an *actual* populist movement looks like. You remember school, when the teachers told you history was important to learn to understand how to avoid repeating it? Now remember how bored most of the kids were in those classes. There's a big part of your answer. People just turn around and say your calling anyone that disagrees with you a fascist Because we rely on the masses to execute the lessons from history.  Taking the lesson from the great depression, one would think the financial well-offs of today (wall street and silicon valley) to help the marginalized and disenfranchized (rust belt).  The idea itself is rather foreign. If anything, people of wall street and silicon valley can't stop driving home the point that ""stupid uneducated republican voter base - red states - got Trump elected."" That helps absolutely no one.  Perhaps its time we turn and help these people, the people who has lost their livelihood due to things entirely out of their control (globalism), instead of letting them stiffed by the government (welfare policies in America? LOLOLOLOL) AND the ""industrialists"" who benefited massively from technological innovation (""LOL you voted for Trump, suits you right to lose ACA-mandated coverage and have to pay for tariffs). But hey, it looks like silicon valley companies are still busy milking them by selling them new iPhone or how Uber drivers shouldn't be considered a full-time employee. Incidentally, I side with companies on this issue - it's unreasonable to ascribe civic responsibilities to private enterprises, especially to those that are successful (and because of their success.) But I totally understand why such is even an issue - whether it is reasonable or not, one has to think about why this is even an issue, and the truth really is that there are people out there that cannot make a living no matter what they do because of things they have no control over.  People who actually have money and means to make changes are simply side stepping and blaming the people who are clearly making completely irrational decisions out of fear. They have no retirement plans and haven't had jobs for years. Their children are double-fucked with college education being unattainable. The problems are real and maybe now that we let this get this bad (fucking Trump in White House isn't a wake-up call enough?), it's time we turn around and think a bit.  Unless we plan on cutting these states out of the union, or take away their voting rights, this is only going to continue to happen. It's so obvious they had no choice but to vote for Trump. Trump, whether it was a bold-faced lie, at least promised them something they know, jobs. It's anti-humanistic and straight-up criminal for Trump to promise these people jobs, the jobs, whether he knew or not, that are never coming back. JFKs speech before he was assassinated.  Same here. But for people to notice there is 3 things they have to do, study history, look around - study the present, think about it. Most cant even study todays economical and political system.  Maybe if we have education system worldwide that would mention these people who have said things like that, who tried to point out the wrong doings, we could have a better world one day. But most important ppl in our history seem to be the conquerors. Columbus, Alexander the Great etc.  Those are the ppl who want wars because they are greedy and want more.   There is so many warnings in history that fit so well today, yet very few know of them. *your ""Where's America?""  ""I'll get him""   *A-hm* ""Bill Nye the science Guy""  America: ""BILL BILL BILL BILL "" I was looking at pics from post WWI Germany. Water-cooled, mounted, heavy machine guns in the streets being operated by women in fancy hats and dresses and men in dress coats. Probably the exact machine guns used at the Somme and other battles a few years earlier.   On record? Where? He's less reticent about staying out of politics than the queen. He champions certain causes and writes letters to government departments trying to influence things (there was recently a court case over whether his 'black spider letters' should be released). It's kind of a case of 'if you keep your mouth shut nobody will find out you're stupid', which the queen does and Charles doesn't. I don't think it's that he's disliked so much as that the Queen Mother is loved. I don't know why others dislike him, but for me it's his lobbying for the use of homeopathy in the NHS that does it.   http://www.dcscience.net/2007/03/12/hrh-%E2%80%9Cmeddling-in-politics%E2%80%9D/  It is disliked that he is a Prince and attempts to exert political influence and power. On things like organic farming, homeopathy and a wide range of other things.   The royal family is supposed to be neutral. Technically parliament and all laws it makes are given it's power by the crown.  If the crown decides it doesn't like a law or government it can technically refuse it. Causing absoulte chaos and swifly abolishing the monarchy for democratic reasons.  Charles, by his past actions of writing letters to MPs and being outspoken on certain issues, gives the impression he would try and influence at least some laws. Republicans dislike him because he using precisly what they are against. Hireditery gained political influence and power.  If he did this as King it would be highly undemocratic. So monarchists dislike him because he could cause the abolition of the monarchy. If he abdicated the monarchy would be safe from this.  TLDR: His political views and actions are irrelivent. He shouldn't  have any publically as the first in line to the throne.  EDIT: As far as making sense goes. I remember him being widely mocked for being pro homeoptathy. Probably more to do with his private life and scandal rather than his political views. I know it's stupid but that's how people are. The same world where Gary Lineker is the effective voice of opposition in the U.K. I was thinking of the social conditions of Weimar Berlin. Right wingers and Leftists fighting in the street, Absurdly wealthy people who have no ties to the nation outside of their bubbles lording it over the common man who has to have a wheelbarrow of currency to buy a loaf of sawdust infused bread. Social mores sinking to previously unknown levels of debauchery. God help the left if they keep pushing because I won't. That's all I'll have to say on the matter. You could also argue that memoirs written by prominent Nazi's won't be the most objective of sources. 1250 pages and panned by historians. Wouldn't be my first recommendation. Read the first two volumes of Richard Evans' [Reich Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Reich_Trilogy) or better yet the primary sources (see my other comment for a short list). I have that book. I had to take it off the shelf though, everyone kept thinking I was obsessed with nazis (neo nazi or something) because it has a swastika on the binding Yeah I don't understand this. By the time he became Chancellor Hitler had already tried to take over the government by force, written a book detailing the need to take over Eastern European countries, and gave speech after speech for years calling Jews and many other groups subhuman. Trump has said things about Muslims that make you think of Hitler and Jews, but it's nowhere near as thorough and hateful as Hitler was with the Jews and as far as foreign policy he reminds me way more of American isolationists in the 30's than an unapologetic Imperialist like Hitler. This is quite a manipulative argument that seems to be intended to convince the reader not to dare make the comparison with Hitler rather than provide reasoned logic not to do so.   The logic put forward implies such a comparison is worthless because all we ever hear is this comparison so it's without weight. That's clearly a defunct argument because you could,  for example, very clearly demonstrate how vastly closer to Hitler Trumps policies are than,  say,  Obama's. All I need do is ask how many countries did Obama ban from entering the US? How many times did Obama talk about foreign nationals in a derogatory way? In fact how many presidents prior to Trump have had such outward negativity and resentment towards multiple foreign nations? These are all just scratching the surface of multiple comparisons you could make between Trump and Hitler that no president prior to Trump even comes close to. Trump is the first president that has multiple times made outward threatening comments towards the media. Guess what dictators excel at? Fear and control of the media. In fact,  the more I write,  the more I realise that you demonstrate a remarkable lack of knowledge about dictators in general. Trump is,  like-for-like, the closest American has come to having a dictator at the helm and he's only just got started. Oh did I mention  suppression freedom of speech? That was another of Hitler's specialties. I'm sure you don't need me to provide examples of Trump's record in this regard. I strongly suggest you read the Rise and fall of the third Reich.  It might make you a little more concerned about your leader.  Stephen Bannon, the man who thanks to Trump has as much power as the president, said he wants to destroy society as we know it and create a Christian utopia. On National Holocaust Remembrance Day, a day every year where the president takes to the press and solemnly laments the atrocities of WW2, Trump used the opportunity to announce a nation wide ban on select people of a religion he claims to be the enemy.  The point you are making would have been true a month ago, and I sincerely wish this wasn't the case, but it's not ridiculous or even a stretch to compare this current collection of individuals to the nazi party. You should be terrified right now, I certainly am.  When it came as Hitler it was tragedy. This time it is just farce.   Hopefully.  But what are we gonna do about like 90% of Reddit?  Whoa settle down their nazi. 50% of the country thinks this way. The other 50% of the country thinks this way.  He's fairly intelligent...Well, was...He's been frequenting TumblR a lot lately though, so you can understand that maybe his opinions have been hijacked by the SJWs Obviously a closet Nazi. But it seems in a post-fact society, truth is dangerous. Remember folks: Alternative-facts are not limited to *just* the GOP.  Not even American, just more of an internet thing. Its really not that uncommon. I hear Nazi comparisons being thrown around plenty by friends and co-workers... usually to describe people who don't agree with their views. Which I think is ironic. Agreed.  The similarities are much closer to a pre-WWI Germany as at the time Germany was the world leader in several categories. Medicine, agriculture, steel and coal exports, also producing 20% more electricity than France and Britiain combined.  Trump isn't like Hitler... not even close, but rather Wilhelm II, the last German emperor.  *Bombastic and impetuous, he sometimes made tactless pronouncements on sensitive topics without consulting his ministers, culminating in a disastrous Daily Telegraph interview in 1908 that cost him most of his influence.*  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor  Imagine if medical science worked the way we've been handling these things. Someone would be diagnosed with cancer, but although the cancer is spreading and having a clear, quantifiable destructive effect to vital body systems, the doctor says we're going to let it run its course. The cancer is a part of your body after all, it has every right to be there just like the rest of your functioning cells. Oh, it's metastasizing and turning other cells into cancer? Ah well, we can't play favorites, maybe the cancer just has a better argument. > We as a human race should be shutting this shit down at the first fucking signs of that kind of thing.   Yet when a person suggests we take action with the lessons of history in mind, they are decried for not being tolerant to the Totalitarians out there who oppose democracy. And then Mussolini started to pass anti-semitic laws as well because he was trying to suck Hitlers dick. >If you don't have nationalism, you don't have world wars  Quite flawed way of thinking. There are many more things that have been the reasons for different large scale wars around the world. Religion, money, and most importantly - power.  Nationalism is a good thing, as long as it isn't extreme. Most things work like that. Hm let's see:   Single: yep  Childless: yep   Middle class: yep   Mid 20s: yep  Male: yep  I'm also white, skilled in a trade, and a middle child. Don't know if that hurts but it sure as shit doesn't help.  See ya on the front lines   Wasn't that the lesson of World War One as well? Yep. The prevention of another general European war is the fundamental principle around which all of American foreign policy revolves. Everything comes back to this, because the consequences of one breaking out are catastrophic for Western civilization. Oh snap. It's just a tradition now so that good old Liz can scare the shit out of them in her Landrover and show them just how well women can really drive. I find the notion that Trump is on his way to a second Holocaust is laughable and disrespectful to victims of the actual Holocaust. I also find it disrespectful to all the Eastern Europeans who suffered under actual Totalitarian regimes, Stain's manufactured famine in the Ukraine comes to mind specifically. Now, if Trump dissolves Congress a la Hitler/Senator(Emperor?) Palpatine, you might have me worried. Once he decides to cut off out of state water access for California because they didn't vote for him, I will horrified. I wouldn't consider Islamic extremists to be a manufactured enemy; they are active world-wide with many instances of violence against the Western world as well as SE Asia.  All these fascist/Nazi arguments came up and were applied to GW Bush as well. They were just as unfounded and ridiculous then as they are now. If this is how it's going to be every time a Republican takes office, the level of discourse will plummet and we might actually give rise to something to actually worry about.  That's ridiculous. It'll be Target. Don't worry trump learned of some previously built FEMA camps from Alex jones. Think the caskets are even on site.  Can the red-blooded patriots still shop while they're pulling switches? They said the same about Obama. This is somewhat revisionist as well. The Nazis engaged in street violence, but people have forgotten that they weren't -unique- in that in Germany at the time; there were a lot of Bolshevik militias and even the ""regular"" parties had their own organizations of party toughs.  So it wasn't a case of the frog being boiled in the pot - the house was, so to speak, already on fire, and the Nazis came out on top because they were more palatable to Germans than the tear-down-your-society Bolsheviks who they were fighting against.  That doesn't make them GOOD, not by any means, but one thing people need to keep in mind is that you can't just say ""well, go bash the fash"" - it's entirely possible that by calling out your show of force, you're calling into being something much larger and much nastier to oppose you. People do well to stay within the bounds of civil society in their disagreements! > [Norway] currently has a right wing government deporting refugees, and taking in less new refugees than nearly every country in Europe, and half of the population backs it.  Are Norwegian politicians being likened to the second coming of Hitler for this?  Honest question, sorry I don't know anything about Norwegian politics and want to know if they are being treated as negatively as Trump for daring to tighten immigration. No there was the league of nations, which failed due to its lack of military power (i.e lack support from the USA due to isolationist policies) and appeasement I heard it was Lincoln Ok I have a question. How is he a fascist? I'm not trying to defend or anything just need an explanation for my own educational purposes. Isn't a fascist one who pushes an anti-democratic agenda that only carries one party?  Edit: Thanks everyone for clarification. The purpose of this is not to rant but to educate.  He was also constantly contradicting himself to the point that he could do almost anything, and you could say, ""he's fulfilling his promises!"" This is one of the most infuriating parts. Why in the absolute *fuck* would you vote for someone who you had no faith in to uphold the entire platform they're running on? And if you don't believe they're going to do the things they say they're going to do then what do you believe they *are* going to do? Thirdly, voting for someone who says shitty things, even if it is solely for the purpose of gaining votes, certainly seems to justify that person saying those things; whether or not you agree with those shitty things you definitely signed off on them and tacitly supported them. And his supporters can hardly stop touching themselves over it. I don't get it. ""we voted for him because he'll keep his promises unlike establishment politicans""  ""Oh, I didn't think he'd actually keep his promises. If only something like this had happened before then we could have determined the outcome without taking an uneccessary risk and gamble on assumptions... when did we see this before  Oh yeah! Stalin, Mussolini, Mugabe, Jong-il, Hitler... oops He means what he says. What a concept!  Who'd have thought. That's the proper way to write that, right?  I supported Trump. Does that make me evil or something? For them who are being persecuted, [it is faith that makes them strong](http://scrolldownandread.blogspot.com/2017/01/are-you-in-misery-have-faith.html) against misery. It is a wonder how Christianity grew into a major religion that it is now, given the many attempts to quash it. Not if Lizzy outlives him out of shear spite I don't think he was criticizing the prince? Rather accusing the media of having an agenda because all his previous remarks about religious persecution in the other direction barely got coverage. (Which I don't really agree with, people are always going to care more about things closer to home.) Fantastic! Thanks! Food unites the world!  Did you make this at 2am? I like my chilli with stout in. And scotch bonnet chillis.  How much is a tin? Tins, eh? Never heard them called anything other then cans. I can only guess you are from across the pond. i like your recipe! my chili recipe is really similar, but i like fresh cilantro too, it's a super yummy addition imo :D (unless cilantro tastes soapy to you, then i guess it probably wont taste yummy for you D:) I highly recommend you throw your spices in with the oil and toast them as you cook the onions/garlic. It will remove any of the dry/stale flavor and make them much more aromatic. Other than that it's a very solid base for a chili recipe. If you add the tomatoes first and fry them as well until they turn nice and brown it adds a lot of delicious complex flavors. If you add the beans and all that liquid straight away, the tomatoes never get a chance to brown properly.  Other than that, and the fact that I use poblano peppers instead of bell peppers, we've got a pretty similar recipe. I also really like hominy in mine. Pretty standard, though maybe a bit much cumin?  I also like to add some habanero, black pepper, sugar, lime juice. >While America has endured problems in the intervening years, nothing has occurred on the scale of the great depression and WWII.  The US hasn't had much experience with their cities and countryside being leveled with bombardments. Europe went through that. The memory is faint, but still there. And my parents, boomers, went through rationing till the mid 50's.   I have no solid facts, just an impression from reddit the news, but a lot of Europeans are quite concerned, along with some of America, about his behaviour. I'm not sure what the feeling in South America is like.  We all die in the end; I just hope it's more likely to be in a few centuries time.  This generational crisis is called [The Fourth Turning](https://youtu.be/KXcDiGpVtbc) I definitely learned the stove was hot because my parents told me so, and we can confirm that by feeling the heat radiate off it. I also learned electrical sockets will shock you without ever having to get shocked before.  We don't have to make mistakes to learn. That only applies to people with certain dispositions. >There are some kinds of knowledge you can't teach; you learn by experience  To be clearer, there are some **people** who are unable to learn except by experience.  And I dislike this idea that Trump is an inevitability, that we all just have to sit back and watch. It's funny because he wrote your for you're and you're for your  And getting beaten back by the Russian army. In Hitler's case, it was mostly the army. People like to say 'oh, if only Hitler hadn't invaded in winter' as though the Russians themselves had no part in it. Stalin basically moved the entire country's production means into Siberia. Just because the USSR was a shit nation to live in doesn't mean that the Russian people didn't fight back. A PRIMER ON CHARLES AND THE ROYALS  1) The Queen is widely beloved  2) The Queen Mother, the queen's mum, is dead. She was loved.   3) William and Kate and Harry are all pretty well liked.   4) Charles is generally disliked. Even among monarchists, there's a feeling that it would be nice if his abdicated for William. While its nice to see him talking sense on the fucking reviled President Trump, he's still a bit of a loony. Big on fighting global warming, but also homeopathy on the NHS and other alternative medicine bollocks.    5) Prince Phillip, the queen's husband, is neutral. He's a very old man who says very old man things. Give him a google. No strong feelings on him really. > the Queen Mother  The Queen Mother has been dead since 2002. People still hold a grudge over the divorce from Diana and his relationship with Camillia.  ""I never knew about the Holocaust and sure as heck didn't commit any war crimes"" - every Nazi in their memoirs  Speer should've been hung from the rafters of one his factories like thousands of his ""workers"" were. This is good to hear. I accidentally subscribed to audible and thought about that book, but 57 hours of nazis felt like a lot so I went with Ready Player One. The more news I read, the more I think maybe I'll go for it next month. I'd argue I'm less concerned about Trump himself (from a comparing to Hitler standpoint) and more concerned about the people he has surrounded himself with. Trump has proven that he is easily manipulated and doesn't seem to hold much by way of core values. The more I see, the more I think he's just a puppet for people like Steve Bannon, who absolutely know what they are doing and have not only an agenda but a clear history of working to advance that agenda. Trump isn't Hitler, but he might be Hitler's front man. What I definitely am concerned about is that you weren't even able to read to the end of my comment...""It's a lazy tactic, and unless the person is using specific information to draw the comparison.""  So not only are you way off base, you are simply restating the point I already made. What you aren't doing is being *specific* about any of the comparisons you are making.  For instance: ""Trump is the first president that has multiple times made outward threatening comments towards the media."" I don't want your characterization of it, I want what he actually said, then maybe your characterization of it. And then, if you want to compare a statement he made to a statement Hitler made, then go for it, i'm all ears.   A convincing argument isn't centered around stating a conclusion or opinion, it is about citing specific facts and drawing a comparison. The most convincing comparisons don't even require the debater to state a conclusion, because the comparison makes it so obvious. If a conclusion is stated, it should be perfunctory.   If you try to strive more towards making your points this way, not only will you be more credible, but you will better understand the conclusions you are drawing, because they will be based in fact and not emotional impulse or gut-feeling.   Yea legit, Hitler was a cunt but god damn could that man rally his people.  Fun camps full of adventure, obviously. haha, really? that would get you thrown out of every social circle here in Germany. And just like Kaiser Wilhelm and his navy, Trump is also overcompensating... so where is your line, to start ""shutting people down"" when they question immigration policy? when they wish for stricter immigration? when they disagree on Abortion or equal pay? when do we shut these people down? and what does that entail? no conservative opinion allowed? no Nationalist? no populist opinion allowed?  Quick, become a woman before anybody notices! Arguably more so than 2. WW2 was a horrible war that brought much of Europe and the world to its knees. WW1 was less humane than just sending millions to a literal slaughterhouse.  Target is way too classy for that, they'd be labor camps.  Well, Norway's right wing consits of **mostly** educated, serious politicians, so I wouldn't compare them to Trump. No one here comes close to being as extreme as Trump, but yeah they are getting flak for being very anti immigration. People are asking why we have to tighten in so much, be so afraid, when we take in less refugees than most of Europe, and we've had one terrorist attack ever, by a right wing extremist.   There has been some lack of tactfullness by the current government. They appeal, as most right wing parties, to the less educated, more afraid people in our country, so there have been some nasty examples of fear mongering, casual racism/mysogyny, and personal attacks/blisters on Facebook. Our minister of immigration shared a post saying we sent back more refugees (some to war zones, some who had lived here for decades) than ever, like she was bragging about it. And of course her fanbase loved it.   Things like that get a lot of criticism yes, but no comparisons to Hitler etc. I feel like my country is becoming more and more polarized, but my general impression is that the US is ahead of us there, so there hasn't been the type of extreme criticism and ""with us/against us"" type of debate like I see a lot of in the US.   I see a lot of unintelligent, unreasonable people in the media/on Facebook, and they're mostly far right. This scares me (mid/left), and a lot of other people on the left side of the political spectrum. But no, the reactions haven't been extreme, although there has been quite a few shitstorms in the media about it. Especially the immigration minister gets called racist and cruel a lot. Other than that, mostly media  criticism and solidarity-posts on Facebook. The left doesn't seem to possess the same type of... anger and lack of social filter as many of the guys on the far right.   The thing is that Trump is more extreme I guess. If we had elected a prime minister and a cabinet of billionares that banned muslims, and proudly announced plans to back out of the UN, Nato, regress women's abortion rights, gay rights, and fix the system so that rich people get even more of an advantage. Politics in the US feel a lot more extreme than here, there's always so much at stake and under attack, so I doubt we'll ever see the same reaction as we see towards Trump now.  Copy pasta from another Reddit post,  ---  Fourteen Defining Characteristics Of Fascism By Dr. Lawrence Britt Source Free Inquiry.co 5-28-3  Dr. Lawrence Britt has examined the fascist regimes of Hitler (Germany), Mussolini (Italy), Franco (Spain), Suharto (Indonesia) and several Latin American regimes. Britt found 14 defining characteristics common to each:   1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.   2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of ""need."" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.   3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.   4. Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.   5. Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.   6. Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.   7. Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.   8. Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.   9. Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.   10. Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.   11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.   12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.   13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.   14. Fraudulent Elections - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control election.   ---  As close as you are going to get to a ""definition"" IMHO.  Look at his purges of federal officials and diplomats that dissent on his policies. Look how he's filling top positions with industry executives. Look how he is making them all beholden to him, or it's their job. The look how he's raising support - promising to remove and subjugate a religious minority. Look how he's showboating to his supporters that he's making things happen via presidential decree (and not via the legislature) - an authoritarian feeling action. He's making his voters/supporters feel beholden to him personally. It's very scary.        Edit: I'd like to clarify my point about executive orders/memoranda. Most past presidents that used these powers did NOT have control of the house, senate, and (soon to be) judiciary. Trump does. So it's worrying to see him use these powers unnecessarily, when he could simply just have Congress present and pass these actions. It's the ""look what I'm doing personally, for you"" message to his voters that makes me very concerned. There is a particular strain of fascism that has been passed down the line waiting to spread.  Some of its characteristics include a sympathy for fascism, a natural hatred of the democratic process, an instinctive affection for totalitarians of all stripes & a reactionary agenda.  [Hitchens covers this strain of fascism in America](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4640373/christopher-hitchens-creeping-fascism-america).  Given the thread title, it'd also be worth watching [In defense of WWII](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F13PqNlP7c) where he tackles all the Buchanan ""isolationist"" talking points.  Worth exploring Hitchens essays on this topic if the above videos captured your interest (Look over your shoulder, [Billionaire Populism](http://imgur.com/a/9brZM), [An Empire after all](http://www.salon.com/1999/10/16/buchanan_5/), [Maestro of Resentment](http://i.imgur.com/vdVu7RP.png), [Arrogance of Power](http://www.nytimes.com/books/00/10/08/reviews/001008.08hitchet.html)).  and perhaps even his commentary on Orwell never really addressing fascism:  >He seems to have taken it for granted that the 'theories' of Hitler and Mussolini and Franco were the distillation of everything that was most hateful and false in society he already knew; a kind of satanic summa of military arrogance, racist solipsism, schoolyard bullying and capitalist greed. [Why Orwell Matters]   Names worth looking into: Lindbergh, Buchanan, Nixon & McCarthy gang (you will find descendants of these figures in the Trump circle as well as their tactics used).   He isn't. ""Fascist"" has just become a political epithet as ""communist"" once was during the Red Scare and McCarthy era (and still is in certain circles) by people with little understanding of it as a comprehensive political ideology. They just draw some superficial comparisons and presto. It has about all the intellectual vigor and validity of people calling Obama a ""Muslim communist"".   I notice a lot of center-right/right-liberals do this by demonizing all of their opponents as ""socialists"" and ""communists"" and a lot of center-left/left-liberals do it by demonizing all of their opponents as ""fascists"" and to say this is extreme hyperbole would be an understatement. Both have more in common ideologically than they'd perhaps care to admit as long as they are liberals who believe in a liberal democracy. Yet they seem so invested in not just considering their opponents in this system a fair competitor but as having an unnatural ideology that's a threat to the very system and democracy itself. Once you recognize this hyperbole and how inaccurate and grandstanding it is it's just a huge yawn-fest.  Every time I go into T_D and I see there's a new way to circle jerk over a fresh violation of law,decency, and truth I think of Padme in Revenge of the Sith ""This is how liberty dies, to thunderous applause"".   You're right. Fixing my comment now. Thanks >  It is a wonder how Christianity grew into a major religion that it is now, given the many attempts to quash it.  Well I imagine it being made the official state religion of the biggest Empires on the planet at the time probably helped :) A while back there was a theory that a Roman Emperor had the entire thing made up, then practiced it, in order to try and reduce the Jewish rebellion that was going on. It was an interesting and theory, and if it was true it did a hell of a job.  I *know* this isn't the most possible outcome but it *feels* like it is.  It would be a tragically hilarious twist of fate. Poor Chuck. He wants it so badly. I think his restless ghost would  haunt Buckingham forever. That's a good point, I forgot about the media's agenda Tell that to the people of Venezuela  Stout works really well. I have friends that swear by it.

[Around 400g.](https://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/food_and_recipes/712777-What-would-you-say-a-LARGE-tin-of-chopped-tomatoes) I concur, cilantro tastes soapy to me so is definitely not yummy. I'm a soaper. :( Was eating that stuff for years before I figured out why certain dishes were great *except for that soap flavor*. > I'm not sure what the feeling in South America is like  Brazilian here. South America is like Africa, we're used to not having a say in the matter and to feeling comfortable watching shit happen from the distance of our subaltern political position. The Brazilian government released a note in the past few days for example, stating it was ""concerned"" with recent developments in the United States. Brazil is the 5th largest country in the world, 3rd largest in the Americas, largest country in South America, largest economy of the region too - and did you hear about our note of ""concern""? Nope. Nobody cares. Actually *most of us* don't care and I'm pretty sure the government just released the note because of a vague feeling they had to say, well, *something*. A minority of the population (young people mostly, but not all, so a group inside a group) are the ones actually aware of what's going on and are concerned. I can't speak for the other neighboring countries, but I suspect it's basically the same situation, the difference being that they're much smaller and first-world governments care even less about their opinion.  And of course, adding insult to injury, there's a segment of the population that even *likes* Trump. **In a country of varied and *deeply* mixed colors, religions, made by immigrants, and that still has a very deep problem with sexism and racism, there's a bunch of morons who actually like Trump**. They can't see that for Donald Trump we're scum, just more possible dirty immigrants from poor countries. I'm not surprised though, since probably the same segment still longs for the old days of the right-wing military dictatorship, some asshats that didn't actually live back then and don't know life without basic humans rights parroting that ""it wasn't so bad"".   We all have problems, don't we.  That's because of America's lack of strong neighbors, and with MAD it'll probably never happen. 27, male, from the UK.   I can honestly say that as soon as I saw the Brexit results I became deeply worried for a few reasons, many were touched on here.  I hate to be melodramatic, but I do naturally lean slightly towards pessimism. I feel it helps to be prepared for it going slightly wrong.  At the point of Brexit,  the following things concerned me. A rise in facial across the EU, one of the biggest countries of the EU leaving it and the rise Russian aggression in recent years.  If Russia is looking to expand, then logically it will start to encroach on the outskirts if the EU.  Except, with Brexit the EU will likely start to fraction ture from the inside as the referendum will add fuel to the fire of other nationalist parties in Europe.  A less united eu with an aggressive Russia can only be a bad thing really.  At this point, trump appeared to be getting a lot of support but I had some evidently misplaced confidence that surely the Americans would listen to how remeniscint his ideals were of Hitler and America between the wars (ie hate and isolationism).  What concerned me the most, was trumps promise to defund national as America is the majority of natos funds.  Once that became a factor in his campaign I started to go from quite neutral about an eu army to being a bit keener on the idea.  But here's the problem. Over the next few years eu member states will have their own elections, with countries like France (rich, stable, founding members) having their polls topped by nationalists. If a couple of fairly core states leave the EU the eu WILL crumble soon realistically. There simply won't be much incentive to stay in anymore.  If there's no eu, and a strong nationalist sentiment in Europe,  with an aggressive Russia and weakened nato, it doesn't take a genius to see what will realistically happen.  Especially as countries won't be as bothered about trade sanctions against Russia when they're organising them individually. Russia will probably look to carry on expanding. You can claim 'ethnically russian' as much as you want,  but it's the same crap that Hitler was pulling immediately before ww2. I'm sure people will agree as well, that Hitler had no intention of NOT starting a war.  With such a similar anti-islam/innigration sentiment to hitters antisemitic ideals settling in America at the moment (as trumps election proved) it's not a great position for us to be in as a planet. Ww2 was brutal yes, but everyone was fairly even overall.  Now? Rather than 6 or so countries on America's level, we have 1. And they're cosying up with someone who has already been aggressively invading nearby countries.  Even if the eu stays in 1 piece and the polls are wrong, even if Trump acts as a wake up call for Europe's nationalist sentiments, the Russia America alliance is still dangerous territory for the world's population.  From the Wikipedia page of the Strauss-Howe Generational Theory:  >  Steve Bannon, Senior Counselor to President Donald Trump is a prominent proponent of the theory.[5] You're working on the assumption the education is A) available to all and B) absorbed by all.  I agree with you - I did not have to touch the stove to know it was hot, my mum told me it was hot, if I got close I could feel heat, and I had a rudimentary understanding of how heat worked.  In keeping with the analogy above.  I can understand and agree with /u/itsatrickgetanaxe above in terms of a generational crisis being repeated when the generation that lived it dies and the new one forgets.  I can appreciate our history and see how we are repeating it, because I was educated about it at school, and not only was a taught about it I paid attention and understood the underlying messages (ish, no one's perfect and we're all still learning).  I also sat next to kids who thought WWII was cool cause of the explosions and missed the point entirely.  And yet other kids that didn't even turn up for the lesson,  And presumably more kids who weren't offered those lessons in the first place, either through a lack of availabilty, or through a national agenda that refused to teach it properly.  Those three groups of kids are the ones that grow up and stick their hand in the stove. Because they didn't understand mummy when she said 'don't touch that it's hot', they weren't listening in the first place , or they didn't have the warning at all.   And they far outweigh those of us who were paying attention.  Respectfully, I don't think that's true.  Listen to interviews with Syrian refugees - they talk about how, when they first left their homes, they assumed they would return in about a week.   Six years later and they're still adrift.    There are certain things that people just don't understand until they've experienced them.  One is the pain of being on fire.  Another is the trauma and scope of total social collapse.   I'd disagree.  There are some things you just don't know til you know.  I include myself in that.    Trump wasn't an inevitability.  Chaos was.  If Hillary had won, we would be seeing similar levels of chaos - perhaps larger.  You know that Trump would not have stayed silent had he lost.   I think that crisis is inevitable.  We control our response to that crisis.  We shape ourselves and our world in response to crisis.    I believe that the next four years will be a crucible in which a new American character is formed.  It's up to us to say what shape it will take.   It's funny because he edited it a minute ago and it's still wrong.  >Prince Philip is neutral  That's bullshit, everyone loves Philip because he's hilarious.  http://telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/prince-philip/9883276/Duke-of-Edinburghs-best-gaffes.html   > No strong feelings on him really.  Ummm not if you're watching The Crown on Netflix. He is Prince Asshole of Doucheington on that show. You know your royals. Could you explain to foreigner like me why husband of the queen is a prince and not a king? This question bothers me since forever. > 2) The Queen Mother, the queen's mum, is dead. She was loved. >   I think you are underselling that. It might be me in my bubble, but *everyone* loved that gin soaked super Nan. People just hate love  trump will never be able to rally the whole of america behind him. He is just not as good of a leader, and the country is just so divided on issues. Have you seen ""Look who's back""? Strongly recommend that movie, but you have to see it through to the end. It's gonna be Zyklon B isn't it? I think Germany might be a special case in this, for some reason... One line is when the chairman of the joint Chiefs and director of national intelligence are taken off the security Council and replaced with ~~Goebbels~~ Bannon.     Too late, they're being drafted too now. (I'm 90% sure)  See ya at the front lines sister! Labor camps for the upper middle class untermensch. A good majority of this is present in U.S. politics, whether you look at Democrats or Republicans. It tells you how we ended up here. Granted Trump pushed some aspects over the edge, but it's not like we aren't there to begin with.  > Fourteen Defining Characteristics Of Fascism By Dr. Lawrence Britt  Why doesn't Dr. Britt have a Wikipedia page? Why can't I find anything about them other than this copypasta? A better list of fascist traits is in Robert O.Paxtons ""Anatomy of Fascism"".   Fascism is a gradient. You aren't Fascist and Not-Fascist. You go along a sliding scale of more or less Fascist. Andddd enough of this.   [The guy who wrote this list had absolutely no credentials to do so, and in fact got most of it wrong.](http://therightstuff.biz/2014/01/22/fascism-no-one-a-response-to-dr-laurence-britt/)  He wasn't a doctor, didn't study those regimes, and got the basics just plain wrong. There's a reason this is copypasta...lets you feel like you're doing something without actually thinking it through.   7.-14 have been us standards my whole life So basically all US politics for nearly two decades? So basically every administration we've ever had When I read that, it screams USA in general, Obama included, not just Trump. People should stop publishing this garbage and simply google to make sure what they are post has any credentials. ""Dr."" Lawrence Britt has no credentials or peer reviews as a doctor nor is he a PhD. There isn't even a wikipedia page on him or any references on the internet that he exists. Do you fact checking before you repost information and state it as facts. What separates fascism from any other authoritarian state? You could apply all of these points to any communist state in the last century.  Half of them describe Hillary, half describe trump.  If people stoped lying to themselves they would realize, that those 14 points apply to both parties. Democrats and Republicans alike.      >Through the press propaganda, through the use of the organs of information, it was possible in England  to found the great model parties. Already in those early days they saw to it shrewdly that there were  always two or three groups apparently hostile to each other, but in fact all hanging on a gold thread, the  whole designed to take account of a human characteristic - that the longer a man possesses an object, the  more readily he grows tired of it. He craves something new: therefore one needs two parties. The one is  in office, the other in opposition. When the one has played itself out, then the opposition party comes  into power, and the party which has had its day is now in its turn the opposition. After twenty years the  new party itself has once more played itself out and the game begins afresh. In truth this is a highly  ingenious mill in which the interests of a nation are ground very small. As everyone knows, this system  is given some such name as 'Self-Government of a People.'       >Besides this we always find two great catchwords, 'Freedom' and 'Democracy,' used, I might say, as  signboards. 'Freedom': under that term is understood, at least amongst those in authority who in fact  carry on the Government, the possibility of an unchecked plundering of the masses of the people to  which no resistance can be offered. The masses themselves naturally believe that under the term  'freedom' they possess the right to a quite peculiar freedom of motion - freedom to move the tongue and  to say what they choose, freedom to move about the streets, etc. A bitter deception! And the same is true of democracy.      -- Noam Chomsky Well, 1 and 4 have -always- been a part of the US.  5, 8, 9, 10, part of 11, and 14 are either wholly not applicable or have no evidence to support them.  6 and 13 are explicitly being fought against.  That leaves at most 2, 3, 7 and 12. Hardly an indication of fascism. Beyond the points others have made, the term, ""purge"" with respect to to high political office, typically means people are being executed. The USA isn't anywhere near that yet. He's following Obama's and Bush's lead on everything you just said there. Especially with EO's. It's good that people are upset about it. I've thought a positive with Trump is that there would be a backlash to remove executive power. Hopefully we see that. Also, I hope Trump/Cruz are able to come through on the term limit promise. He already came through with the lobbying ban. I feel like Reddit has really jumped to doom and gloom lately and it's not realistic. He's doing these things, because he has the power to, new presidents before him did the same. The fear mongering definitely got to you. To escape the hyperbole you may try reading the Doctrine of Fascism or Mein Kampf. There are more than just a few disturbing parallels with our current government.  A sane logical comment.  Get out of here! Wasn't the Han larger? The history of religion and humananity has always been about people killing others who don't share their religion. Think Moses leading the slaughter at Mount Sainai. Up till then, people believing in thousands of different gods had lived together for several millenia.  The religion with the most aggressive intolerance will win in the end. Read up on the Emperor Constantine. Its what you are alluding to and it was him that adopted christianity in the Eastern roman empire (the Roman emipre was run by two Emperors at that point East and West as it was so large).  This was more to handle the problem with the christian rebels and religious troubles in general and made it a lot easier to collect taxes. He had say on what was put into the new testament and what was left out. The Western Empire set up the catholic church in Rome thorugh St Peter at the same time and used a Latin bible the common roman language of the time.  The orthadox bible (East) was allowed to be written in the local language. This is why there are some differences between a Catholic bible and an Orthadox christian bible. The East empire later became the Byzantium empire. It sounds like a giant lie It existed long before a Roman Emperor practiced it It still unites them.  no hablo espanol Yes my fianc has the same problem. We often buy two bottles. The one for the chilli and the secret one that I pull out when the first stout doesn't make it into the dinner.  Thanks, mate Obrigardo/Obrigada. Thanks for that insight.   If my Portuguese or Spanish were as good as your English I'd really want to emigrate over there. And his actions as a Boomer - precipitating a crisis now that he's in power - fit exactly with their theory.   http://time.com/4575780/stephen-bannon-fourth-turning/  This goes into more detail about Bannon's views. My favorite George Carlin quote: ""Think of how stupid the average person is and realize that half of them are stupider than that.""  I don't know when shit's gonna kick off, but my family is _not_ in a good place for a crisis right now. I'm in my second year of college, my father is going to go back to get a degree in administration, and my Brother is two years away from college age. To top it all off, my father (main bread winner) is making a quarter of what he's made for the past 15 years. It's probably too late to start trying to prepare myself, so it's gonna be a rough ten years. Many people have it worse off than we do, and I'm honestly scared of the trouble Trump is guaranteed to steer us into. You don't have to experience the pain of fire to avoid it.  I have never been burned by fire but I know how to avoid it and that it is good to avoid it.  I have never experienced war but I know it is good to avoid it. I also know how on an individual level should we fail on a wider democratic level.  What people fail to understand is that a small minority of people are willing to afflict pain on others for their own gain. They will start wars to make themselves rich. Because this is so inexplicable to our own way of thinking we fail to recognise it in others.  We see Hitler and other fascist leaders as evil exceptions to the human race. In reality they are not unusual, it is what happens when a certain type of person wishes to gain power and keep power.  The majority of Americans recognised the threat and voted against it.  Let us hope the checks and balances of judciary and legislature are strong enough to avoid too much damage from the fault. The Syrians simply had hope that they could return. Many still want to, if only for the cold reception. Few people ever really expect total societal collapse in their own country. >Following the Dunblane massacre, he questioned the need for a firearms ban: ""If a cricketer, for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which he could do very easily, I mean, are you going to ban cricket bats?""  So he's about as sane as the average American. I don't know, I came out of that series having more respect for his idiosyncrasies in real life - guy had to give up a lot Did you even watch the show? I completly disagree. In fact i think he is the most likeable of the whole cast.   I guess different taste and all that massive oversimplification. he is not a douche, nor is he really portrayed as one. it was a complicated situation King sounds superior to a queen A king outranks a queen, as shit as it is. It's actually been a problem for most queens historically - it made the pairing off of Queen Elizabeth exceptionally difficult since you'd be handing him the keys to the kingdom.   Phillip is Prince Consort to avoid this (as was Victoria's husband, Prince Albert). And the formal bit of being ""prince"" only came ten years after the marriage for Phillip, it wasn't an automatic elevation. A lot of this stuff is about interpreting tradition, rather than hard and fast rules.   See also : Queen Margrethe II of Denmark. Not British, just really into British TV shows, but I think it's because the husband isn't descended from the previous king/queen, so he's not allowed to ""rule"".  Prince Phillip is quite the racist; they try to keep that quiet. It used to fly, then it was able to be brushed off, now it's just embarrassing. He is technically the Queen's Consort, as he was not a king himself and so cannot bear that title even through marriage. Also has to do with female-male perceptions of past generations, i.e. Elizabeth (and Victoria and other queens) being superseded by their male spouses because of a lack of equality between the sexes. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_consort Our Queen is both a queen and a king, as the title 'king' is given to the head of state (which she got through inheritance). She is also however, female, hence the (most used) title 'queen'. Philip is a prince (plus a duke and a load of other stuff because silly titles are fun) because it's the next rank down. The name for a person in his position is a 'royal consort', I believe. Basically, the queen is also the king so he gets the next best thing. I can only go on what people say now - I was like 12 when she died. Just googled her and her face didn't even ring a bell.  Kid's these days eh!  No... Zyklon C... it's a new century, after all.  but we also don't call people Stalin or Bin Laden or whatever. Why is that a line? What does that even mean? We've had an increasingly authoritative government ever since 9/11, or maybe longer than that. Trump is like the icing on the cake. That's largely because America successfully created a false dicotomy of left and right, which even now you see American redditors frequently using with little apparent comprehension that what they're describing is the choice between right and even further right.  Sure the Pendulm might swing between the two, but for at least four or five decades now the swing to the right has been more violent than the counter-balance that swings back the other way.   The cumulative effect of this has been to push the boundaries ever further right to the point where positions once thought to be alarming are now safely secured in the landscape and considered moderate as new and ever more extreme frontiers are opened up  The natural end product is what you see in Donald Trump, and he's probably not the worst. I have to suspect there's more to come yet in two or three cycles time.  There's a reason we've dropped out of ""Full democracy"" status in two indices in the last year. We just dropped in the EIU rankings too.   [Link if you're interested](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/01/daily-chart-20). normalization of bad behavior in politics is part of the slow shift to autocracy. instead of saying ""well everyone does it"" you should probably vote those people who do it out, shouldn't you? Sorry, it *is* like you weren't there to begin with. Charitably, Trump represents a step-change in terms of:  1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 11, 13 and a slide in the rest. I think in this case you can't paint the parties with broad strokes.  There are individuals within both parties that fall under this definition, but far fewer Democrats than Republicans.  Part of that is because there are more Republicans in elected positions, of course, but I can't think of a single elected Democrat that fits more than 2-3 of these bullet points.  (Mostly the cronyism and friendly relationship with businesses.) Exactly my .02... people are acting like all this shit just started happening the minute Trump got into office. We've had a fascist government for some time, only now it's painfully apparent... The guys running the show for the last ~75 years have been slowly turning up the heat, but Trump cranked things up quick and now the frog may jump out of the pot... Trump never pushed some aspects over the edge, he's just more blunt. I thought this too as reading through it, but if anything Trump takes much of it to another level.   i.e. ""Disdain for human rights"" could be found in policies all throughout American history. Trump's recent ban is a clear example, which is telling at the very least.  >Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.  That one scared me the most. He is not a doctor, his name is Laurence W. Britt, and the list is taken from a fictional book titled [*June, 2004*](https://smile.amazon.com/June-2004-Laurence-W-Britt/dp/1884962203/102-0771497-5956965).   [Source](https://www.ryananddebi.com/2004/10/16/laurence-britts-14-points-of-fascism/) (See number 26 for the statement from Laurence aka ""Larry"" himself)  I dug a bit.  This bullet point list seems to have been originally published in the [Free Inquiry Magazine](http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php/articles/category/freeinquiry) in March 2003.  You can have Umberto Eco's definitions, which are pretty much the same. [It's pretty much identical](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/) Because it's fake. He isn't a doctor, and he didn't study any of this.   http://therightstuff.biz/2014/01/22/fascism-no-one-a-response-to-dr-laurence-britt/  You should also look at the different examples of Fascism in Europe. The German, Italian, Spanish and UK (plus others) each had different ""facets"" from the Fascist playbook.  Simply because a movement is lacking in one or two typical aspects doesn't mean that they aren't basically a Fascist (or today ""modern movement with similar underpinnings to Fascist"") political organization. When I think defining characteristics of Fascism, I think of Mussolini's quote:  >All within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state.  Maybe everything isn't perfect now, but we aren't throwing people in jail for talking shit about Trump or for protesting. I don't think people realize what a true fascist America would be like. It's not just some strict immigration policies and birth control rights issues... it'd be quite a bit scarier.  America isn't a fascist state. It's not perfect, it could do a lot better, but we're not putting cripples to death and throwing people in jail for dissenting by writing critical posts on facebook about their president or country. The basics are correct but keep riding that horse. It's sort of like how a little bit of poison doesn't really hurt you. That doesn't mean more of it is a good thing.  Fascism isn't a binary state. Some of those elements by themselves and in the right dosage aren't really that bad and some can probably be good.   The problem is not just that they exist, but the mass increase of all of these elements centered around Trump.  Well compared to a lot of the Western world America has been extremely right wing for quite a long time. Sounds like he's the same idiot doctor (Andrew Wakefield) that said vaccinations cause autism without any research. Causes a mass hysteria and next thing you know a bunch of kids on the west coast are  getting mumps because they aren't vaccinated against it.  And they apply to communist nations as well... ha. That's a rather astonishing perspective. The effective president's number one advisor has a media organisation noted for dishonesty and twisting of the truth. That's control of the media. Not a lot of the media or most of it, but control of it. You think the media back in nascent nazi germany was suddenly run by the nazis? No, comments were made baout their lack of ethics and grounding and 'improvements' were made. Trump has already blacklisted certain news sources, decried vast swathes as fake news, and personally singled out certain journalists such as the disabled one who contradicted him quoting his story on allegations of scatted celebrating as a source as to whether tens of thousands of people had celebrated 9/11 in New Jersey. He's only 9 days in, it's undeniable there's fascist attempts at suppressing the press, both in threats and action. Get a reality check.  Beyond Trump being vastly corrupt there is no evidence he's making any efforts at removing conflicts of interest, AKA CORRUPTION, and has given out government positions to people who may not be qualified but certainly have given him money, AKA CORRUPTION. Only idiots actually think Trump is draining the swamp. Again reality check. I'm not gonna bother going through the list but since they are explicitly being done I doubt i need to bother.  Are you serious?  Considering this is gilded I'm wondering if this is some high level satire I'm not getting. Because that's still like more than half of the points? You guys sure you're not fascist? They were very aggressive too. They would attack neighbours without provocation, using their powerful archers to destroy enemy armies at range. Indeed, a long time ago in an empire far far away, the Han shot first. They were roughly equivalent. Population wise they were about the same. Economically, rome was probably richer, though it's hard to say since they didn't have the same types of resources to draw on.  Han wasn't that large. It only had like 1/4 of modern China.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_dynasty That's a funny anti religion statement but it's actually false. Religion was mostly spread by trade as most of human history is based on trade not war (but trade is boring). Look at Islam for example. Traders would convert to Islam so they would be able to trade with the super rich and influential Muslim countries. This is why you get Islam if you follow the old trade routes from Africa to Asia.   This idea that religion was mostly spread by war is so ridiculous. By miles and miles the most contact between different cultures is by trade and not by war. Always been like this and still is. I'm all for giving up on outdated religious concept but this kind of badhistory shit scares me. Rewriting history is bad because it makes you repeat mistakes.  Actually, the whole Moses thing is not accepted as fact by most Catholics, as it is proven by archaeological evidence that the Israelis did not come from outside, but were likely Canaanites.  The Catholic Church does not require Catholics to believe this as literal history, and basically the whole first 5 books of the Old Testament have no evidence to back them up as fact.  This is the general consensus among Biblical scholars.  Just keep the faith of Abraham religious history discussion to after 1000BC and you're on better ground. Here, you dropped this: ~ Ya Prince Phillip is a jerk who throws a hissy fit about kneeling to his wife at the coronation (like he didn't know he was marrying a future queen), spends all his time sighing and complaining about royal duties taking him away from his flying lessons, and generally has a bad tude.   I've never heard anyone called Bin Laden or Stalin either.  Funnily enough, it just watched Bill Burr's new special on netflix, he has this bit where he goes off on how Stalin killed 3x as many people as Hitler, but nobody seems to care. Everyone just gets called ""the next Hitler"", like Stalin and Mao never happened. Authoritarianism has increased at several intervals in American history:  1.  Alien and Sedition Act at the turn of the Nineteenth Century.   2.  Andrew Jackson/Abe Lincoln eras for a whole host of reasons.   3.  Wilson with all his bizarro pseudo progressive policies including the Espionage Act of 1917.   4.  FDR with putting Americans into concentration camps and fusing corporate power more fully with state power.   5.  Nixon with the war on drugs.   6.  Bush II onwards with the PATRIOT Act. With Dippin' Dots on top.  ""increasingly *authoritarian* government ever since 9/11""  FTFY. But don't sweat it, we got your drift. It's incredible how effective 9/11 was... all of the anti-Muslim rhetoric, and now actions, stems from that. 2 wars, fear of Muslims in the US and much of Europe. The purpose of terrorism is to destabilize governments, spread fear, drive divisions in between people.  https://thinkbynumbers.org/government-spending/false-sense-of-insecurity/  Edit: nepenocreativity's link is intriguing. I find bin Laden's comments to be potentially disingenuous (if his goal was what he stated, he was an idiot); however, I may have conflated somewhat the (stated) goals of Daesh and al-Qaeda. I do stand by my statement on what the EFFECT of 9/11 was, regardless the goal. Trump is a symptom of the problem rather than the problem itself. Longer. I think pre-Reaganomics was the last time a president lowered the authority of the federal government. This! No dictator was put into power overnight. They all came about through the political parties of the time, making incremental,and at the time seemingly 'reasonable' changes. In many cases, something which on the surface seems like a good change actually paves the way for more and more erosion of freedom and abuse. You can point to #10 as starting with Reagan who broke the Air Traffic Controllers union.   Yeah,  it's crazy seeing it from a European perspective.   People genuinely calling Sanders a communist and from what I can tell he just wants to bring America up to the same social care standard as every other developed nation  > That's largely because America successfully created a false dicotomy of left and right, which even now you see American redditors frequently using with little apparent comprehension that what they're describing is the choice between right and even further right.  I know a lot of Americans who totally understand that our left is like centrist-right in other countries, but it's much easier to say ""left and right"" than ""right and extra right."" In news terms we have a group that sees CNN and Breitbart as equivalent tails and heads of a coin > I have to suspect there's more to come yet in two or three cycles time.  Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho.... This is exactly right. And still they scream about liberals and socialists. When many of us know that the true liberals are not represented here at all.  Yes - sadly - imagine a person with Trump's policies, but a lot smoother talking and more subtle.  Seriusly of you compare the US to most other ""first world"" countries its incredibly easy to see that they are much more right leaning that most. Happy cake day! :3 Of course, but Hitler doesn't absolve then of their traits, either. The point made is that we are in a trend, not some random anomaly and we need to react as such. A lot of Democrats talk a leftist/progressive game but then support war, increased surveillance, erosion of civil liberties, and policies which generally support their corporate backers.  Obama is a perfect example of that.  To hear him speak you'd think he's a pretty damned progressive guy, but if you listen to him other times and look at what he did... he broadly supported the corporate right wing.     The only one that comes to mind to me is DWS. For what it's worth this list is complete bunk, and written by a science fiction writer and not a Dr, seriously. https://www.google.ca/amp/therightstuff.biz/2014/01/22/fascism-no-one-a-response-to-dr-laurence-britt/amp/?client=safari >June, 2004 is new thriller based on today's headlines. John T. Retlin is America's new President, and he possesses unprecedented charisma and media appeal. So he is able to exert such influence over the TV news media and its corporate ownership that most Americans don't even notice our democracy slipping away. The author explores the most troubling issues on Americans minds. Among them are increased voter apathy, a deteriorating political culture, the American obsession with and worship of celebrities, and the media's powerful influence in shaping public opinion.  That doesn't sound like a criticism of conservative policy or culture. Quite the opposite actually. I love how an article bashing the credibility of Mr. Britt is written by an anonymous poster.  If you read the article, Mr. Britt never made the claim of being a doctor.  That was attributed to him by some idiot on the internet, and while he did not go to school for the subject, he did actually spend a lot of time studying the topic. No no no, you misunderstood him. He's not a doctor -- *he stayed at a Holiday Inn Express last night*.  That's what I mean by the graduating scale of Fascism. The problem really comes from where the line between Fascism and standard Nationalist Autocracies is drawn.   Everything can have a hint of Fascism. I mean they were revolutionary (not philosophically but practically) in several areas such as how they utilized propaganda and the way they took power.  There is one thing most countries that fall to fascism have in common.  > Maybe everything isn't perfect now, but  People keep saying this kind of thing until its too late. I know it sounds hysteric, but its absolutely true.   I'm concerned that too many people feel this way and it is allowing fascism to grow.  I dont think we should normalize or shrug off a violation of our rights just because it's not as bad as some other possible violation.  We've been doing this in the US for too long and we have lost a lot of rights since 9/11 with no indication that it's going to stop.  It appears that we will lose a lot more over the next few years. 57 million in it? I will have to check Roman Empire population when I get a chance.    > This idea that religion was mostly spread by war is so ridiculous.  Of course it is. But OP didn't make that claim, so why are you arguing against it? Trade is the best way to peace. This isn't exactly true.  Muslims even in Mohammed's time would routinely raid traveling caravans.  One of his successors famously said that Europeans couldn't float a log on the ocean.  This was in reference to how they routinely attacked european trade ships.  Then ofcourse you have the constant raids into Europe with the primary purpose of taking slaves.  They attacked as far as Iceland.  Oh and all the killing that destroyed the Byzantine empire.  Or the tens of millions killed and enslaved throughout India.  The main reason people converted was either to live or to not be a dhimmie. All the magic shit that Jesus is alleged to have done is legit though.   so archaeological evidence is ok when it proves something you believe, but when it proves evolution it was put there by satan to trick us? \/  got it Worth pointing out that there's no evidence Philip was pissy about or hesitated when kneeling to QEII at her coronation irl. He was royal by birth and knew the importance of publicly swearing allegiance and submitting to the ruling monarch.  He was also not supportive of the whole Margaret affair for pretty much the same reasons, unlike the show's depiction. Dude was all about the deference and the *public perception* of royalty back then As opposed to Prince Charles today (not 15 years ago).  Charles tries to do good with his position and stature, with all his charitable enterprises.  He's trying to find a way to be both royal and a contributor. He cleaned up his act in that way. You realize that you're basing all this off of a fictional television show, right? I think it's because Hitler killed other people nextdoor and Stalin killed his own people.   If you kill your own citizens no one really cares (especially if you are Russia). All the Western countries had been trying to kill Russia before. (Not during WW1 or 2 but before that ie: Napoleon).  I'm not saying it's OK to kill your own people, but the outside world doesn't really care. Cough cough North Korea. How was FDR fusing corporate power and state power?  I was under the impression his pro-union pro-minimum wage pro-welfare policies undermined corporate power. Are you suggesting they might be ice cream of the future? I would like to refer you to this comment in bestof a few days ago on this topic:   https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/5qpioz/redditor_explains_why_radical_terrorists_have/dd1hfvr/ Seriously, most of these have been the rule for a while. American here: People who've been raised since children to stand for the flag and recite allegiance to it daily do not understand the difference between socialism and communism. Most of them would be proud to be called nationalist because it implies America first.  We've brought this on ourselves. Most American liberals are uncomfortable with the fact that they are actually centrists.  You can see them self identify as leftists, and then literally use Nazi propaganda to denounce people who actually hold those beliefs (**Regressive Leftist = Cultural Marxist**).  Whenever it comes time to criticize capitalism, they'll regurgitate everything the right tells them.  However, when it comes time to brag about transfer payments, everything becomes Socialism. (I think something about registering with an American political party makes you partially illiterate?)  Government Healthcare? Socialism.  Roads? Socialism.  The Military? Socialism.  The best part? They'll repeat Red Scare rhetoric/propaganda while insisting that the world humour their twisted vocabulary. If the republican party would participate in european countries they wouldnt even pass the 5% mark. And calling Hilary left.  Ha. Because of the influence, power and reach of the wealthy large-business owners who fund campaigns and draft legislation that gets passed in their favor. Those are the people who have the most to lose if a guy like Sanders improves this country. Insurance companies and Big Pharma don't donate to political campaigns to better the lives of others...just themselves.  Yep. It's ridiculous. It damn near brings me to tears thinking what we could have accomplished with Sanders. I'm seriously going to have to leave at some point in the next decade if something doesn't change.  As far as I can tell America's ""left"" is most other countries's far right there has been 20 years of perma-hysteria from the GOP.  the sky has been falling all the time for a very long time now.  the right wing has effectively destabilized the institutions of government over time. it's sad.  And those of us who think both are shitheads are forced to read 10 different sources and have to spend 2 hours to determine the actual facts of real news.     Infuriating.   Thanks! It always has a way of creeping up on someone haha. Lets put it this way, a lot of ideologies have cross traits. It's when your hitting every one on the head, do you become a fascist. You don't understand, a Democrat would never allow mass surveillance, prolonged wars, travel bans, the silencing of whistleblowers, and the free reign of corporate interests. I mean, for crying out loud they let us have sex and marry whoever we want! /S I dont think they're questioning whether it harms conservatives, i think they're wondering why there's such a focus on this text and author being the de facto authority on fascism.   Who said anything about ""conservative policy or culture""?  The subject is America at large. So where was the media and the left for the last 8 years while whistle blowers were punished? Now all of a sudden that kind of stuff matters to people again because ""their"" person wasn't elected? Roman was 56.8 million as of 1AD. I was thinking zone of control, not population~ He claims religion and humanity is always about killing and slaughtering. This is such a weird claim that seems to be thrown around so Willy nilly.  War is exciting. War is cool. War makes awesome stories. Trade is boring. Most of history is peaceful and boring. You cannot evolve as a society while constantly murdering everyone. It's bad for trade. People weren't savages. There is a reason oldest writing regards trade.  People need to stop claiming that history is made up of war and slaughtering. This is wrong and serves to make people think it is normal to be at war all the time.  For a while. Then the traders start buying political power and taking over empires, and using the power of the imperial armies to further enrich themselves. If you wanted to prove you're the son of god would you do mundane shit or magic shit? If you're Catholic, yes.  But if we're going to be talking about history it's best to avoid all the stuff from the Bible from before 1000BC.  We won't ever have historical proof of miracles happening or not, but we can make deductions based on the context.  When you know the Israelites did not originate from outside Israel, then it throws all of Exodus into question, because that is basically the Book of Exodus.  We can't really consider it history if it didn't happen.  That Jesus existed is much less contentious. Idk about other denominations, but Catholics are free to believe in evolution.  I do.  The father of genetics, Gregor Mendel was Catholic, FYI. Most Catholics are not anti science.  I don't know a single Catholic who does not believe in evolution, and I see lots of them at church. Can't watch The Crown for all the dramatic license it takes. It gets the historical facts right, but the context and personalities mostly wrong.  True. I meant more the character of Prince Phillip on the show and not the actual person, since we have no idea what he's really like behind closed doors. Lol they're the same kinda people that can't tell the difference between news and propaganda. They probably think all the dramaticized scenes on history channel is real footage too. Fusing with govt is the key there. At one point in 1940 more than half the economy was going through the govt, whether it was making cars, airplanes, or guns. Since there was little consumer economy at the time that was the only game in town, so instead of the corporations leading the govt the govt lead the corporations Not if Sean Spicer has anything to say about it!  I do not wish to live in a future with only $6 shot cups of Ice Cream balls. i scream of the future you scream of the future Is this the queue for ice cream? Mandatory ice cream for everyone! I've wondered about this a few times actually  I mean Presidential portraits in public buildings, flags in school classrooms, lapel badges, forever telling yourselves that God blesses you, its all part of a conditioning and its difficult to act surprised by the results This is genuinely a very good point, though I disagree that liberalism is never leftist; Rawls for instance is certainly on the left despite being a liberal. My favourite is the title they give their president ""The leader of the free world."" I'm on the far left in America, pretty sure I'd be considered moderately to the left in most of western Europe. In this last election cycle, I've been attacked more by moderate Democrats than by Republicans. People who angrily explain to me that single payer healthcare and post-secondary education are unrealistic and are not economically viable. Sanders, according to them, is an economically illiterate communist idiot for backing these proposals, and that I must be an unamerican sexist for pointing out that Hillary Clinton has the economic and foreign policy of a 1990s Republican.   George W. Bush is a victim of a bad timing: if he was 20 years younger, he could've run in 2024 as a hero of 'pragmatic liberal values' to these people. Ha!  I got called a Marxist last night on this very site when I commented on Alexis's open letter. I'm a liberal Bernie supporter (voted Hillary in the general) and generally support a robust social safety net, free or very affordable education, and a living minimum wage, among other things. Marxist indeed. Unreal.   Oh I checked out his comment history he's an altright neonazi fuck so I didn't really care but thought it was pretty hilarious to be called a ""lying Marxist"" when I posted Giuliani's interview video where he explained how the Muslim ban (his words) came to pass.  In Sweden, I'm not sure even the Democrats would. Well, it depends ... backed up by the church they would get atleast 20% in every country located south of Germany.  Btw, I can't understand how the American churches are able to support someone like Trump, aren't there any internal conflicts? They would be banned in germany because of facism. Seriously.   Same in Canada. Your Republicans are batshit crazy. Unless it's the UK which is sliding into the place of mini murica. Which part of the Republican Party?  I've met a slew of libertarian leaning irish Done that.   Mr Trudeau is a lovely leader. I constantly find myself pleasantly surprised when, for example, the RCMP is caught misusing private intelligence records and he immediately orchestrated the people involved being fired or suspended and rules changed to better protect citizens privacy, including a privacy commissioner to keep them accountable and an inquiry with publicly released results.   Like... woah...   >those of us who think both are shitheads are forced to read 10 different sources   Number of sources is irrelevant . You could spend all 10 on abcnewz.ru foxpronewsw.ch etc .... There are plenty of people who support neither corporate Democrats or right wing Republicans.  And there is no inconsistency in condemning the harmful actions of either.  A huge problem is partisan blinders, but not everyone is wearing those blinders.  Hopefully, more and more people are starting to see the problems and inconsistencies within the ideological groups which they identify with.   For one point, name me one that has complained of vote rigging before an election has even taken place.   For 2 points, name me one that has complained of vote rigging after they've won the election.  For ten points, mention another president or runner up of any party that has ever complained of vote rigging after the election.  To my knowledge, Trump is the only one, and that unsettled me.  I think you've missed the point, it's not that it's a purely Democrat or Republican issue, rather its that these traits have been present under both parties. Not only that, but the severity to  which they have been present has increased with such an alarming frequency that what would have been considered extreme and excessive once, is now seen as acceptable and normal now. Wealth too. Rome mined a ludicrous amount of gold in Europe. The Han were aware of the Empire as well. Its also a pretty silly statement when you take into account earlier history. The ancient Greeks weren't exactly going around crusading in the name of Ares or Zeus or whoever, for example. Awww .... Spoiler Alert !!! Yeah, I always thought it was weird how Moses died before finding the Promised Land, despite having a G(od)PS.

"12",11,"5r7vg0","2017-01-31","Shit, we forgot Ukraine again.  This is the most slient war I have seen in a long time. It is kind of scary how the media controls our actions through inaction. This is giving me a great idea, I will rob a bank and if I get caught I'll say Russia tricked me into doing it. 10,000 Ukrainians killed...  Wow.  I had no idea.  It goes to show you how this Trump fiasco has distracted us from important world events. I live in Ukraine and talk to people involved and nobody knows what is going on with the war. It's a clusterfuck. Russia is waging a nasty hybrid war and like all wars the truth was the first casualty long ago.  Ukraine had no problems with violating ceasefire even without ''baiting''.  They have been doing it for 2 years now. I love how Ukrainian media was all like ""our glorious army has liberated another town from separatists"" whole previous week, and then rebels bite back they go ""ERMEGERD! THEY'RE VIOLATING CEASEFIRE!!!"". Well, duh. Color me surprised.  So in other words the government violated the ceasefire (again) and they want to blame it on the separatists by saying, ""But, but, they baited us! It's not our fault, they made us shell and bomb civilians!' You see, it's not Ukrainians who violate ceasefire, it's the separatists who trick/bate them into violating ceasefire.  The spin is strong with this one... Here's a less one sided article :  Anxious Ukraine Risks Escalation In 'Creeping Offensive'  http://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-creeping-offensive-escalation-fighting/28268104.html  What a joke this headline is - ""seemingly baiting Ukrainian troops to violate failed ceasefire"".   If it wasn't the side the media/trans-Atlantic political class supported, it would just be ""Ukrainian troops violate cease-fire"". This is so transparently biased as to insult one's intelligence.

This should be interesting (in a very non-trivial way) now that the US has new leadership.  We're thinking of you, Ukraine. Cmon Ukraine get your shit together, either push them out or sign a permanent ceasefire.  Ukrainians have every right to territorial integrity but it seems it is something the katsaps don't know anything about. Stalin and other soviet leaders sent Russians into other countries i.e to steal their land. Ukraine has every right to defend its territorial integrity from aged soviet ideas and current russian aggression and I can only hope the west does what it didn't do with Crimea in kicking out every Russian proxy out of the Donbass.

By the way this isn't new, for the past months/year the ""*donetsk rebels*"" aka goddamn russian forces have repeatedly used mortars/grad missiles to bombard ukrainian forces, how the fuck is that not a breach of the ceasefire?   The Putin troll team is strong in this thread. hey   SALLY YATES!  Hero of America, Do something about this injustice your country has perpetrated, since you are somehow a hero!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Who is funding this war? Is it Soros? Russians baited them in to attacking and tacking a outpost just as Trump was officially president , and the next day they cried about losses .... Reported as FAKE NEWS Probably won't matter since it's in thus subreddit. OMG only -15 downvotes. HAhhh Who cares, a white kid shot and killed 6 Muslims in Canada and he was a Trump supporter, we need 6 threads related to it on a front page. Worst home alone sequel by far.  Apparently, Ukraine has been chipping away at the territory in the neutral zone (between the warring sides) through the so-called ""creeping offensive"". [Here is a pretty good article](http://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-creeping-offensive-escalation-fighting/28268104.html) that describes what's been happening. I am afraid that Russians by attacking this town are testing new American administration.   Humanitarian factor (freezing civilians) may trigger counter-offensive action from Ukrainian forces. In consequence Russians will accuse Ukraine for violation of Minsk-2 agreements and intensify actions against them.  Facing further escalation of conflict United States will be forced to show their cards. Trump earlier declared his readiness to improve relations with Russia, it is quite obvious that Putin wants him to play his game. Don't worry, the Ukrainian army has you covered. Ukraine started an offensive last month and is now crying wolf when the rebels retaliate. That's basically how the 2015 fighting started.   See http://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-creeping-offensive-escalation-fighting/28268104.html You're free to pay closer attention. You don't need to be spoonfed news on Ukraine. Its there if you want it Nah, Yemen is even worse. Ukraine got a lot of coverage initially, Yemen is the one that got barely any publicity whatsoever.  Most? Yemen anyone? >It is kind of scary how the media controls our actions through inaction.  But some mep from Belgium had a comment about Trump, that's headline news. i use this map here https://liveuamap.com This is not a war, this is a campaign of state terrorism. Why the fuck are we calling Russian terrorists who kill and terrorize civilians for political purposes ""separatists""? And what will Trump have to say about this? Is he going to endorse or even support Putin here? Deus Ex: Invisible War In Ukraine I know it's probably ""/s"" but in all seriousness you'd have to get bombed a bit first.   It was swept under the rug after 2015 too, well before the election. Once Minsk-2 was negotiated the EU/US became more careful about making noise about the actual conflict itself, even if they continued other forms of support (such as closer NATO deployments) and increased their general rhetoric against Russia. Many identify ethnically as Russians, of course the media isn't paying attention when they are simultaneously trying to demonize Russia over flimsy allegations of hacking.   The bombing and shelling by the Ukrainian government has been so bad that over a million refugees have fled **to** Russia. About 2,000 of military and 8,000 civilians. These number are true.  Not to mention news outside of the war. Ukraine just passed law that effectively bans speaking Russian anywhere, and on top of that nationalized the nation's largest bank, Privat Bank, in a move to control illegal payments made to businesses who don't pay taxes on the transfers. The whole country is going to shit and you can't even find an english article on it if you did want to know. Its depressing, honestly. The ""Trump fiasco"" was part of it, since Trump was pushing the idea that it's not a big deal, and it's worth being friends with Russia. Putin's approval rating among republicans shot up after he said that.  People didn't necessarily forget, they just remembered a different angle. This is why I have complained about the news over reporting on Donald Trump. I'm not saying that they shouldn't report on Trump, but instead of focusing on the important news, they have shifted their focus to include unimportant things Trump does. Important news from other topics gets 0 air time. For instance, instead of hearing about the Ukraine war, we hear about Trump plagiarizing bane. This helps Trump.  That figure's the absolute minimum. Even if you exclude unreported combat fatalities, you can be sure that many thousands have died of starvation, lack of medicine, etc. At the start of the conflict, Russia was leveling some Ukrainian villages near their border, in order to clear supply routes. Can't imagine what happened to the people that lived there. It's a lot more on Obama than Trump. > like all wars the truth was the first casualty long ago.  Damn, dude, that hit me hard. Stay safe, internet stranger. It's kind of crazy to realize how ignorant we can be of events happening in our proverbial backyard, if we don't get information about them from government and media sources.   > nobody knows what is going on with the war.  I find that hard to believe.  If your government doesn't know what is going on in the war I'd get the hell out of there as soon as possible. I talk to my relatives in Ukraine every now and then, and they all keep repeating this term ""hybrid war"" yet nobody can provide a coherent explanation as to what they mean by it. And everybody admits they don't really know what's going on, and yet they are convinced that Russia attacked them. From my perspective, people are simply too afraid to admit that what they call a ""hybrid war"" is nothing else but a good old civil war (not without international involvement on both sides, of course), and this civil war will not simply end with the defeat of the Russian imaginary forces in Ukraine.  Principal Deputy Chief Monitor of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine: [90% of ceasefire violations are happening on territory that's not under the control of the Ukrainian government](http://ukranews.com/interview/1322-zamglavy-myssyy-obse-khug-bolee-90-procentov-narushenyy-proyskhodyt-na-nekontrolyruemoy-pravytelstvom-terrytoryy-donbassa). That's a diplomatic way of saying ""Russia's doing the shelling."" They also count it as a ceasefire violation when Ukraine responds to the Russian shelling. Pretty safe to say that Russia's responsible for pretty much all of the escalations in violence.  But that obscures the point that none of this would be happening if Russia hadn't invaded Ukraine. source?? According to the OSCE's Deputy Chief Monitor, [90% of the ceasefire violations occur on the Russia-controlled portion of Donbas](http://ukranews.com/interview/1322-zamglavy-myssyy-obse-khug-bolee-90-procentov-narushenyy-proyskhodyt-na-nekontrolyruemoy-pravytelstvom-terrytoryy-donbassa).   The difference this time, is that the Russian side's ceasefire violations are happening on a far more massive scale than usual, and are killing and injuring a lot more people. Also, the Russian bombings have shut off the gas (i.e. heating) and electricity in Avdiivka, and Russia has refused to let Ukraine repair it. Needless to say, that's a war crime. The Russians are hoping for a strong response from Ukraine, so that they have a pretext for further escalation, including, perhaps, the overt introduction of Russian troops (instead of always having to use the idiotic excuse that the Russian troops fighting in Donbas are ""vacationers"").  The only intentional shelling and bombing of civilians in Donbas that has ever happened was done by Russia. The prime example is the Mariupol bombing, in which [the Russians killed about 30, and injured about 100 people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2015_Mariupol_rocket_attack).  The ""separatist"" commanders are always complaining that your ""separatists"" are mostly Russians, and that the locals don't want to fight for them. That figures, since [according to polls, most of Donbas is opposed to Russia and its proxy groups.](http://windowoneurasia2.blogspot.ca/2015/09/dnr-poll-finds-population-doesnt.html) Perhaps they should leave Ukrainian territory. When they leave the can complain about being shot at. Untill then fuck em. Not separatists. ""Russian""-separatists.   The propaganda must flow.    >You see, it's not Ukrainians who violate ceasefire, it's the separatists who trick/bate them into violating ceasefire. The spin is strong with this one...  Unfortunately for you, this is exactly what we saw Russia doing in Syria. Declare a ceasefire and make sure the press is there. Then bomb civilians, wait for the rebels to shoot back, and then pretend Russia is the victim and use it as an excuse to continue killing even more. And you know this... how exactly?  Ukrainians *did* violate ceasefire. That's what the facts say. Oh, poor baited Ukrainian army, positioning it's artillery within the city, with people living everywhere around. Poor Ukrainian army that is mauling separatists was ""baited"". Like anyone would fucking believe it.  Separatists have no reason to ""bait"" them, despite Ukrainians saying that they did.  EDIT: I misread your message. I thought you were really blaming separatists for what was clearly Ukrainian army's fault. Thank you, that is indeed a much better article  Yeah how dare Ukrainian troops try to fight to defend their own country. Most of the people running away from Russia's war in Donbas are [Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) within Ukraine](http://voxukraine.org/en/2016/06/30/great-migration-how-many-internally-displaced-persons-are-there-in-ukraine-and-what-has-happened-to-them-en/):  > According to the Ministry of Social Policy, 1,785,740 internally displaced persons were registered as of June 6, 2016, including 1,100,000 women and 700,000 men [5; 1]. Because god forbid someone has a different perspective than you. Where else are they going to comment ? /r/food ? Proclaiming the superiority of borscht doesn't have the same ring to it.  u/allthegoodweretaken  is that you? last active, 14 days ago. this account is 14 days old. coincidence, i think not...  It never stopped.  Russians are on Ukrainian soil. Who's swinging first again ? Yeah? Better say fuck Ukraine, cause its a fuckin civil war, you stupid retard.   Just fucking think for a second if you have brains. What pros would Russia have starting this conflict? Or what pris would it have escalating it now?  Watch Oliver Stone's movie ""Ukraine on fire"" if you want to know something about this war, and about Nazis that are spreading inside Ukraine.  And watch couple youtube vids of Anatoly Shariy, Ukranian journalist who had to go to Europe, cause in Ukraine his life was threatened. He has subtitles on some of his vids. You would be very surprised about Ukranian propaganda. Thank you! Tell your friends about it. Obama didn't give two shits about Ukraine and Trump is in Putins pocket. I doubt much changes. >either push them out   Difficult when the other side can engage as many resources as it needs to keep the conflict at the exact intensity it wants.  >or sign a permanent ceasefire.  Also difficult when the other side has no interest in a real peace, only in a protracted conflict that prevents Ukraine from getting closer to EU and NATO. Last time we tried, they sent their regular troops with no insignia and the outcome wasn't that great. Permanent ceasefire is impossible because it doesn't accomplish the goals of either side: Putin started this war to make Ukraine obedient and totally controllable, we started to fight back because we don't want to be obedient. Permanent ceasefire just hangs the process of our final liberation for us and process of returning us into their sphere of influence for them. Ceasefire sounds good, but it simply impossible, especially considering that Russia is suffering from sanctions and has to act faster, they don't have decades for this shit, they want to accomplish it asap. >katsaps   Interesting. Should we start calling Jews and Blacks Ki *es and Nig *ers now?  Long story short, with the annexation of Crimea he more or less made it impossible for Ukraine to join NATO or EU. Donbass is a trickier beast - it has become obvious that Russians are not planning to annex it, but need it to a) be able to destabilize Ukraine at will, and b) have something to bargain with and offer concessions - because Crimea is a done deal and they're never going back on that.   Basically, he is fucking our new client state in the ass, severely limiting its utility to us, and making it not particularly worth it for us to support. And he's actually done a pretty good job at this. Most of the things we were hoping to get out of Ukraine are out of reach now, and there is less and less to be gained over there. Just Jihadi Julian is trying to spin propaganda in favor of Ukraine. It makes no sense to separatists shell own areas.   Wrong thread. Top kek Who's writing your comments ? They don't make sense.  Man, it's almost like there are a lot of Reddit users from North America. Who knew. I dunno 3 and 4 were prreeettty bad. So Ukrainian forces entered Avdeevka which was in rebel hands in violation of cease fire.   Rebels pushed then back.   Media claims that they were ""baited"" out and it was rebels fault? That makes Trump in two Damn Ukrainians for chipping Ukrainian territory... I'm afraid that Trump and his administration is in on this. Russians? Aren't they Ukrainian separatists? My God, mass media making its job good.  My dear friend, press secretary of Ukranian defense force spoke lots of times (I remember 2) that there are no Russian divisions in Ukraine. There are no fuckin Russians military troops that are fighting in Ukraine! If they were there, all Ukraine will be gone in couple of days! How you fuckin retards cant understand that?  You just believe what girl from tv is telling you! Search for some real evidence about Russian invasion and you will be fuckin surprised!  By the way, president Poroshenko is the owner of a couple of factories producing military stuff, it is very good for him having this war goin on and on. And he has a chocolate factory in Russia, not givin a shit, that as he says - Russia is ""agressor"". He s paying giant taxes in Russia. No, you still cant start your brain?  Ok. They dont even call it a war, they call it Anti Terrorist Operation on east. Terrorists are their own citizens, who doesn't like nazi government in Kyev.   If you doest know, before all that crap about ""Terrorists"" and ""Russian invasion"", Ukranian Air Force bombed civils on the east of its own country in the beginnin of 2014.  And last, you stupid retards. There are no words and no one was speaking about, that Russia should do this or that in Minsk-2, and while discussing Minsk-2. Know why? Cause they dont fuckin fight there!  And one more thing. There were some TV news in Ukraine about bombing DIR (or LIR, dont remember) couple days before that shit started today. People on east are simply fighting back, they dont push.  This is bullshit, the ""creeping offensive"" was response to Ukrainian soldier being killed on the LOC by separatist who breached the line. Russian troops are integrated into DPR and LHR separatist and have primarily been the ones pushing for escalation. [removed] >  Its there if you want it  Yes, but the actions of world leaders and individuals depends on mainstream coverage of events like this whether you like it or not. In a sense, the media is controlling politics and war.  is there a similar sub reddit discussing the Ukrainian conflict the same way that the Syrian civil war sub does? www.liveuamap.com is a great resource for staying up to date with global conflict  Edit:  Why the downvotes?? I mean, that's a tiny number, and vast majority of those are military casualties. This has been a small and remarkably clean little war. That's partly why you didn't hear that much about it. If Russia is so evil, why have over a million Ukrainian refugees fled to Russia and ran away from Kiev? No, if you get bombed, you'd be called pro-Russian separatist.     E: It's ""if"", not ""I'd"", nasty Swype! The people that identify as Russians are a minority in these areas, or at least they were before most of the population left.  It's not like Crimea. > Ukraine just passed law that effectively bans speaking Russian anywhere  Not true, please stop spreading fake news. Thanks. I'm far from the action, fortunately.  The OSCE is trying to observe but they don't get too close.  There's a clear definition of ""hybrid war"" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_warfare   It is technically a civil war but Russia most certainly did attack and sent their own men and weapons across the border and then pretends they didn't. The kremlin cannot have Ukraine move toward europe and civilization and a frozen conflict to prevent further european integration is precisely Putin's strategy.  > happening on territory that's not under the control of the Ukrainian government   If I throw bomb in your garden before it'll explode, the violation, technically, will happen on your garden, which I have no control over.

You need to update your sarcasm detection algorithm   Edit: dont know why I'm being downvoted... I wrote my comment before he made the edit Whichever side you support in that conflict is immaterial to my criticism of a laughably biased headline. I'm sure the same types of publications would take such a generous enlightened view of Syrian troops defending their own country, or in the past, Libyan troops, Iraqi troops, or Yugoslav troops defending their own country. It has nothing to do with different perspectives.. It's either true or false. You can't just say something is right, just because you feel like it.  I could have another user than this one, to avoid angry pro-russians?  I flag every single pro-russian bullshit-spewing account in RES. And this post is all red. Good point. It's just funny because i have them all flagged in RES, and everytime there's a post about Ukraine, Syria, Georgia or whatever conflict Russia is having it's filthy hand in, the same persons show up to spread misinformation > borscht   FYI, Borscht is a Ukrainian dish. The closest Russian analogue is Shchi. Yes, and almost all of them were born there. Those who are not defending their homes. I like Oliver ,but disagree with him on MANY topics. Look a director made a documentary. Must be true!!! Fuck Anatoly!! Just because he is a Putin patsy Ukrainian doesnt mean shit to the people of Ukraine. Fuck you . You are a cat turd in the punch bowl. So smug with your misinformation.  I assume you will say that the Russians living in Crimea voted to join Russia. That would be like Mexicans in Texas voting to secede and join Mexico. Doesnt work that way. Crimea was taken.  Putin admits that there are RUssian troops fighting in the Ukraine. Yet Its a punishable offense in Russia to admit that Russian family members died fighting there.  You are clueless in your ignorance oh,lord jeeesus. And I assume because most of the people in Crimea are Russians,that ,ya know..Russia just HAD to take it. Right. LAst I checked it was the Tartars that should have taken it back.  Its not a civil war when Russians are invading and fighting Ukranians.  So,fuck you right back.  By teh way. There are Nazis everywhere. I have watched the Russian propaganda videos.  Russia is stoking these fires. Same with Georgia.  I lived in Russia. They Despise Georgians and Ukrainians. Its not even thinly veiled. And ,yes,during WW2 the Ukrainians sided with the NAzis. I would have too.  FUCK RUSSIA No one's going to come and save the Ukraine. You're going to have to eventually take the territory back.  You know a ceasefire won't work, so you've only got one option then.  Funny, how most nationalist Ukrainians hating Soviets yet due to Soviets their country is 5 times bigger than it should've been. Poland got territory from the Germans after WW2 such as Danzig and apparently during the Polish-Ukrainian War of 1918-1919 it was the Polish who were the aggressors in invading Galicia. Romania was a Nazi ally during WW2 so I wouldn't complain too much about giving those back and Czechoslovakia no longer exists and it is well known that there were slovak SS.  The only thing to complain about would be Crimea however after he USSR [may it forever stay dead] collapsed we seem to have gotten around to letting annexation no longer be a thing plus the Tartars were not exactly enthusistic about Russian rule but I guess the more things change the more they stay the same People already do but insulting a nationality is a different matter moose and squirrel mudak. Honestly, Russia nor Putin do not want to destabilise Ukraine. It was one of the biggest trade partners. Just Ukraine nationalists went full retard. They have been proven to have done it before. They are russians, they don't give a shit about the locals. No, that is categorically false. Aveevka has been in Ukrainian hands since it fell back in summer of 2014. Rebels have been trying to take it by pushing into the industrial district.  Source:  - Go to liveuamap.com, scroll back in time all you want to the summer of 2014, look at avdeevka. - Oh, and also the fact that I have family in Avdeevka oh we get your agenda Boris Would that be the Ukrainian government or the Ukrainian separatists? Well Kiev junta tried to break treaty that it signed in Minsk, but who cares - lets blame Putin for [Poroshenko performing genocide on his own people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHWHqj8g7Bk)  My friend said his uncle said he saw Trump driving a tank in Crimea!!! They were until Putin amended his lie.  That lie was too hard to push after new  equipment and ammunition turning up. And machinery which requires expert knowledge were used. Hm, account for half a year, every other post is about Ukraine. Hmm That's Ukrainian propaganda, both sides have been shooting at each other and both sides are to blame for exchanging fire. But that has been happening thoughout 2016 and has resulted in few casualties. The recent spike in violence and casualties is due to the recent Ukrainian advances.  Lol. Why do comments get so aggressive as soon as facts are presented contrary to the narrative?  Because people don't care. I hate to be this guy but the media isn't a secret cabal of world schemers. They are profit engines. They report on what people want to hear the most. That happens to not be rebels in Ukraine.  I agree that it deserves more coverage and that the media should be more responsible. But that doesn't get you out of doing work yourself. If you want to learn more about a topic do that work. Don't blame CNN or whomever.  If you want to learn more about it I would suggest looking at Vice News (used to be an HBO affiliate), they've done a lot of coverage of the war. If you have a problem with the lack of coverage in recent years, I would recommend contacting MSNBC, CNN, CBS, or whatver else to do a news story on it.  I'm pretty sure world leaders don't wake up each morning and make their to-do list based on what they hear from the news. They not only have their own teams of people who are in charge of briefing them of world events, but also teams of intelligence officials.   If you as a citizen feel like your government is not aware of the importance of issues like this, perhaps spread awareness among those uninformed citizens around you and encourage them to contact those who represent them. Sure, government leaders may not have to listen to you but public pressure in the form of awareness and demonstrations is a real effector in politics. It's really important to focus on a ground-up strategy than trying to convince just leader of your country. If you want an unbiased picture, go to both /r/Russia and /r/UkrainianConflict. UkrainianConflict is pretty biased in favor of the Ukrainian government, but at least it isn't as awful as /r/ukraina. /r/ukrainianconflict /r/ukrainianconflict is the best. It is not biased as some weirdos claim. I'm neither Ukrainian nor Russian. I defended both sides about many things for many times. Never have I been warned or banned. While mostly pro-Ukrainian, there are still neutral or pro-Russian people. Most importantly, EVERYONE can discuss properly. It's not about being ""pro-something"". Almost everyone on this sub is decent and regardless of which side they support, you can have fruitful discussions with them. It is one of the least biased subs where you actually have freedom to speak and not bashed to death, imo. I say this as a guy who writes positively about both sides - I even met some people from this sub in real life and yet they are to cut my throat for being an ""ukrop"" or ""kremlin puppet"".   TL;DR it is not as extensive as /r/syriancivilwar but still good enough.  Not that I know of, to be honest. I would bet there is though. That's a great resource, thanks for sharing. Putin personally bribed every one of them. ""I'd you get bombed""  can you re-write that? I don't actually know what you wanted to say,maybe they should change the hiring policies in putins troll team to actually require employees to have a degree in english literature and writing. Not a minority. Atleast half. I currently live in the country, and can link you an article about any of it in Ukrainian or Russian if you'd like.  > bans speaking Russian anywhere  Not anywhere, only in official documents, registered media, government meetings etc.  > The kremlin cannot have Ukraine move toward europe and civilization  That's rather naive to think that Ukraine was actually moving in that direction to begin with.  In any event, saying that it all started just because Russia invaded, while ignoring the obvious internal problems that have existed in Ukraine even prior to this will lead you nowhere, not to mention that the fact of actual invasion is dubious, to say the least. While for Ukraine, closer ties to Europe may be a chance to grow its economy, for Russia - Ukraine's current political stance represents a threat to their national security, unfortunately. Unless this fact is given careful consideration, Ukraine will remain torn.   It's a diplomatic way of stating that ceasefire violations originate with in the Russian-occupied territories. And yes, the top OSCE guy on the ground in Donbas is a good source. OMG, Anatoliy Sahriy? For real? They guy who fled Ukraine, and make one fake news after another for Russian money? OMG, how can any sane person can **really** consider Shariy a journalist? A video from Sahriy? Are you mad?? Are you fucking joking me?? A fucking Kremlin propaganda mouthpiece disguised as Ukrainians journalists?   Fackaf dude!! Ya.  Sure.  I didn't know that [Komi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsen_Pavlov) was in Donbass.  or [Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Strelkov_(officer))... [again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Borodai)  In fact most of the fighters are either ethnic Russians, Russian citizens, Russian military, Russian volunteers, Russian paramilitary, Russian Cossacks, Russian tourists or Chechnyans. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Donbass#Pro-Russian_insurgents)  ""An Armenian volunteer in the unit [Vostok] said the battalion was composed of Slavs, and that roughly 80% of militants were from Russia""  I think this ""local rebellion"" narrative bullshit should be put to rest at this point.  The war in Donbass is and was orchestrated, funded and [operated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatist_forces_of_the_war_in_Donbass) by [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_military_intervention_in_Ukraine_(2014%E2%80%93present)).     This is why the so-called ""Russian Spring"" failed in Kharkiv, Kherson, Odessa, Zaporhizia, Mykolaiv, and Dnipro. There is no legitimate support for secession.   Its not their territory.  It is Ukrainian sovereign territory which is currently under occupation by Russian proxy forces.    Get your facts straight sir.    Yeah, I've misinterpreted what you've said.  Seemed like you were really defending Ukrainians for violating ceasefire (like some other comments here do). Actual source:   http://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/296416 29 Jan   http://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/296071 27 Jan   http://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/295996 26 Jan    As you can see the number of ceasefire violations is similar on both sides with the separatists committing slightly more violations (about 1.5 : 1) during the reporting period. However most of the residential damage observed during the reporting missions happens in the separatist controlled areas which suggests that the federal side uses heavier weaponry.  Don't make up bullshit without looking at the actual stats.  >For every 1 Ukrainian Army ceasefire violation their is 3 by Separatists. >Source: OSCE.  No, there isn't.  Source: OSCE   You see how easy it is when you don't provide links to the actual reports. So please provide an actual link to an actual report by OSCE stating that.   *Hint: There isn't one. > For every 1 Ukrainian Army ceasefire violation their is 3 by Separatists.  Oh, really. Show me an OSCE report, stating this exact calculation. Oh, you can't? Maybe because it doesn't exist and you made this all up? Yes because Russia would never bait anybody. They totally don't shell Ukraine from Russian territory. They aren't even in Ukraine. That plane that was shot down? Not by Russian missiles. Ukraine did that.  I'm sure that every headline that doesn't come from RT and Sputnik is laughable to people who refuse to believe that one side can do absolutely no wrong. Sure, but you can use entirely one sided sources (western/ukrainian or Russian) and completely ignore completely valid points from the other side, which is what you are doing. >I could have another user than this one, to avoid angry pro-russians  or circumvent bans from certain subreddits (r/ukrainianconflict) for example... I do this too, and they have never failed.  I have never seen a single one of these people I've tagged make a post that didn't involve Russia. They don't even need to be paid. These people parrot Kremlin talking points for free. If there is one thing Russia became good at during its Soviet years, it's disinformation and propaganda.  Borscht is a Slavic/Eastern European dish. Russians, Poles, Ukrainians, Belarus, Latvians all have their own versions - indeed many are regional. Ukrainian beet-style borscht has become the most popular version over the last couple of centuries and has become almost synonymous with the name, but nevertheless, it's not the only one.    I love how the Russia trolls whine incessantly about the west giving weapons to Syrian rebels and then proclaim the Ukrainian rebels as being righteous freedom-fighters who surely aren't benefitting from any sort of Russian aid. At least the west in all its stupidity has never equipped idiot rebels with medium-range surface-to-air missiles. > Yes, and almost all of them were born there. Those who are not defending their homes.  1. I've heard numerous DNR/LNR commanders complain that their troops are 80% Russians, from Russia. You can find clips of Strelkov complaining that he couldn't even get a thousand locals to join him.  2. Defend from what? There was nothing to defend against, until Russian ""protest tourists"" swarmed Donetsk, and started brutalizing Ukrainians. At the same time, Strelkov and Bezler (GRU and FSB) were taking over regional admin buildings in Donbas.  3. Most people in Donetsk don't support Russia or its terrorist proxies. [Here's a poll from Russian sociologists](https://windowoneurasia2.blogspot.ca/2015/09/dnr-poll-finds-population-doesnt.html):  >  Despite what many would expect, Moskovsky komsomolets reported, the majority of the people in the region were not against the Ukrainian Maidan and for the DNR, and although the agency with pride reports that the number of such people in recent times has increased by seven percent, that brings the number only to 29 percent, that is, not even half.  Good going, Russia. After your ethnic cleansing campaign, your support is up by a whole 7%! Any proofs that he is somehow related to Putin?  Almost every video he makes is supported my proofs, otherwise he says ""I think"".  You may disagree with Oliver, but this guy makes his films on facts. > LAst I checked it was the Tartars that should have taken it back.  Why? Fuck those guys. The khanate was destroyed for damn good reasons. They can assimilate, whether into Ukraine or Russia, but their time of political dominance is forever over.  People in Crimea joined Russia cause they didn't want Ukranian Nazis to start agression like they are doin it last 3 years on east. Ukraine has no balls to fight with Russia, thats why its calm in Crimea. Yep, we know that. Same shit really. That was before. They sure as fuck want to destabilize Ukraine *now*.  Bullshit. Also why don't we see any protests against ""russians"" then? [removed] What Ukrainian separatists? calling it a genocide is the new troll fashion? They're supplied and funded by the Russians, and once in a blue moon a specialist piece of equipment shows up. On a couple of occasions Russian military even intervened directly. But that doesn't change the fact that the separatists are mostly locals, and the number of Russian soldiers in the theater is tiny.  So Putin admitted it? So what? Does registration on reddit somehow correlates with true or false in my replies?  You know why I post about Ukraine? Cause Im tired of all bullshit people post here!  West dont give a shit about what is goin on there, all they want is to demonize Russia.  Why there are no posts about main agreement with opposition at the end of 2014, that was signed by opposition, Yanukovich, Shtainmayer and other europian politicians? That agreement was about president election and stoping of opposition agression. And just after that agreement, opposition on maydan said to protestors that they wont implement it, and dont give a fuck about all stuff they've signed, that they wont revolution now and no matter what. Next day the revolt started.  Why no posts about that? And why all europian politicians who signed it doesnt give a fuck about that? Like everything is fine.  Why no one talks about Minsk-2, and that Ukraine haven't done nothing from this document? But every western politician is talking that Russia should start following Minsk agreement, even that there are no words about Russia at all in this agreement?)) like, what the fuck is goin on? And how long people gonna eat shit that mass media is feeding them with?  People should start using their brain, thats why I post about Ukraine. >Ukraine started an offensive last month and is now crying wolf when the rebels retaliate.  Became  > both sides have been shooting at each other and both sides are to blame for exchanging fire.  Lol which lie does it become next. Never trust a russian. Right now the smart money is all on ""we hate Trump, don't we?"".   I wonder what else is getting overlooked by all the presidential attention.  I don't think he's blaming them as much as analyzing the situation Totally agree! I'm sick of people portraying the media as some sort of boogieman. It just reports what people want to read. If the public showed more interest it'd be covered more. It's simple supply and demand economics. News organizations are on their last legs, trying to figure out how to monetize in a digital world. /r/Russia is frankly a terrible sub to learn anything about this subject. /r/UkrainianConflict is an unabashed circlejerk - but at least they don't ban the few dissenters. Except it's completely unlike the Syrian civil war sub, because it's entirely biased towards the Ukrainian government. /r/ukrainianconflict is terribly pro Ukrainian government biased. Even objective posts criticizing what Ukraine is doing are downvoted to hell, that's why anyone not pro UA left the sub a long time ago. It doesn't even present one side to the conflict, it just posts pro UA propaganda and that's it. motherfucker how can you ever defend Russia That's not how disproving a fallacy works. You need to provide me with a link that shows Russian is banned in Ukraine.   http://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-new-language-law-will-make-ukrainian-exclusive/ You can get fined for speaking it generally as far as I've heard. I've lived here for many years and I'm not naive. There have been people working toward setting up a legitimate judiciary, reforming the military and much more for many many years. Yes, it still remains to be seen if a proper police force and governance  can be formed and an environment that allows business to flourish and civilization to be built, which is precisely why Russia started this war and maintains it.   Ukraine  will remain torn for many reasons for some time, not only a still feckless Ukrainian ruling class. The internal problems were ignored by Yanukovich. I know this because I've spoken with a high level SBU officer to resigned precisely because of this.   I know guys that kill Russians who their own government denies are there, and I'm taking care of family that had to flee when the Russian mercenaries showed up in Donetsk with Russian equipment. I'm not going to argue with some stranger on the nternet. If you think the Russians didn't invade, that's fine, you can believe what every you want. I don't care. I don't have time to argue with strangers on the internet. I'm to actually survive this war.  Man, he refers on two official ukrainian (!!!) channels. Or 'OMG, OMG' is now enough for discussion? Shariy is an asshole. But it's not like he faked those interviews. Bitching about him is simply sidestepping this inconvenient little tidbit.   > make one fake news after another for Russian money  The most irritating thing about Shariy and his work, is that much of it is accurate. Like stopfake etc he relies on catching Ukrainian media with their pants down, so his own editorial bent is not very important. Hi /r/ukraina! Ready for another cauldron?  You, of course, forget to mention that Shariy fled Ukraine because Yanukovich' government fabricated a criminal case against him after he revealed some high profile corruption scandals for that government. Shariy has integrity, and why would he need Russian money, he makes millions off his businesses and prefers to be his own boss so he can provide independent journalism. The man is a Ukrainian hero. Jesus fuck. Shariy is a colossal asshole. But he didn't fake those goddamn interviews. Those clips came from Ukrainian TV, that shit really did happen. Your comment is a spicy combination of red herring and ad hominem, spiked with a metric fuckton of salt.  He refers on two ukrainian channels. So you can blame them, dude. He is one of the only honest Ukrainian journalists. He opposed Yanukovich' government and he opposes the current UA government. He criticizes both UA and the seps when there is something to criticize. Perhaps if you watched more of his vids you would see the true picture of what's going on in Ukraine. He provides plenty of videos and has plenty of reporters working within Ukraine, stellar level of journalism. Care to address the content of the video instead of the ad hominem? Yeah, they're ""Russian"" as in """" which is a general term referring to people from the former USSR, and NOT people are citizens of the Russian Federation. English doesn't have a separate word for it like there is in Russian.  I am an example - I am from Belarus, I've only been to the Russian Federation twice, but I'm still Russian () even though I'm not a citizen of the RF. Indeed! Because every single discussion on the internet has to be a serious one. Your handlers seem to have forgotten about requiring your attendance at ""Sarcasm 101"". This is unacceptable. Your rations will now be slashed to 1 vodka a day.  The OSCE reports do exist as I linked in the reply to the comment above. The problem is they completely disagree with his assessment. > They totally don't shell Ukraine from Russian territory.  No different or more illegal than Turkey shelling Syrian forces in that war from over the Turkish border but of course, that doesn't get anywhere near the same type of response or criticism, which brings me back to my point about laughably biased coverage.  > They aren't even in Ukraine.  I'm sure there are or were at the least Russian advisors among the eastern Ukrainian rebels.  > That plane that was shot down? Not by Russian missiles. Ukraine did that.  No, I don't believe that. I believe it was an accident by eastern Ukrainian rebels after mistakenly identifying it as a Ukrainian air force jet.  > I'm sure that every headline that doesn't come from RT and Sputnik is laughable to people who refuse to believe that one side can do absolutely no wrong.  Wrong - You know nothing about anything I believe on this conflict or anything else - You just heard one thing you didn't like and assumed everything. You can if you are an idiot, like banantomat. Not saying they are paid.  Although many of them i remember from when the conflict began back in '14 when they created their user. I've seen examples from some of them where they've forgotten to change accounts, and have replied with one of their other users.  They live in an alternative reality where people who oppose the ""partyline"" are ridiculed.  They are raised to believe that the west want to harm them, and that Mother Russia is the strongest in the world, the one to rule the world.  It's sad to watch :( I have never seen anyone denying Russian help of rebels. Too bad CIA puppets in Kiev haven't closed Ukrainian airspace for civilians after losing several military planes there. 1. Citation needed. 2. Trains of Friendship, read up. 3. I couldn't find the source mentioned by MK.  ""Ethnic cleansing."" Wow. Find a single instance of ethnically motivated murder committed by the rebels. Speaking of eating up bullshit propaganda. You have been duped hardcore. Guess those Ukranians are killing themselves and blaming it on Russian troops. Russia is still pissed that their boy their patsy for Putin was ousted by the people. Gotta keep that gas running to Europe,maintain bases in the Ukraine. Speaking of I remember how proud I was when Ukranian soldiers faced with Russian aggression conducted themselves.  Russia seeks to rebuild the Soviet Union. Putin has expressed that numerous times. Sad how obvious it is but there are certain pathetic people in this world that believe any thing. Tell us when u go in ATO. I will praise that day. You are surrounded by a foreign army armed to the teeth. You really are going to go out and protest?  and how much did Putin pay you to post that horse shit? or how much of it was influenced by the new administration? I think he means the Russian soldiers in plain clothes pretending to be Ukrainian ex-USSR and ex Ukrainian army.  > separatists are mostly locals  Yeah, you can easily spot locals and newcomers. I did. A fucking drunken scumbag with a Nazi eagle and a clearly Middle Russia accent.   Whom are you kidding?  No he didnt, and he won't to this day. Honestly, like others said, there is very little direct Russian involvement (i.e. actual Russian combat troops in the Donbass region). Yes, Putin has sent possibly millions of dollars in aid in the form of weapons and vehicles, but so has America. There is no ""good"" side in this war.   I am very well aware that life in Russia can be really tough thereafter I will not report your account.  Poor devils like you are just doing their job, each post similar to those above buys em a potato or some kasha.   Live well my Soviet friend. Just don't do Krokodil and don't drink Vodka before noon. Exchanging fire and launching offensives aren't  the same thing.  That deleted comment I was responding to was probably not a Russian, a really self hating one perhaps?  Yemen is a big one that's been overlooked for far too long now. Its not just hate. Both sides are drawn to Trump stories.  But yea, plenty is being overlooked by focusing on headline material That's possible. Whenever I see statements like ""It is kind of scary how the media controls our actions through inaction."" they tend to mean the media is some conspiracy to control us, at least from my experiences on Reddit.  Vice has problems, but their Ukrainian Crisis coverage was actually really good. They had journalists on both sides of the conflict and didn't ignore the shit either did for the most part. Of course it has a pro-Ukraine stant, but that's not a badthing g. Not just vice. Any major news network really OSCE isn't free from bias either though. Like when they criticized the president of Belarus' upcoming election, who then invited them to oversee it (they refused), and then condemned it anyway for some reason. Lol /r/Russia doesn't ban ""dissenters"" it bans ""peaceful posters"" who like to spam the sub with death threats and downright hate speech. Any ideas why that is?  I used to go on the sub back when the war was hot but it got old how anyone remotely neutral on the subject was labeled a Russian shill or an idiot for not being 130% behind the brave boys on the front fighting the demon hell spawn russian mercenary terrorists. Except the Syrian sub is the same. The vast majority of people support the assad government. ""objective posts""  as in ""pure propaganda""  I guess when Ukraine does blatant propaganda some people like to point that out too?  That's already counted as defending Russia.. If you'd like more feel free to ask. And stop undermining the people of this country's struggle unless you've actually witness what they're going through firsthand. Anyone can throw links around on the internet while they sit in their comfy home.  https://strana.ua/articles/analysis/51465-yazyk.html Source? Dude, I don't know in what country you lived, but it doesn't sound much like Ukraine. I grew up in Ukraine and still visit regularly  - saying that ""There have been people working toward setting up a legitimate judiciary, reforming the military and much more...."" - is an overstatement to say the least. The country is a shithole and no better than Russia. Probably, even worse.  I agree with you that Yanukovich gov't was part of the problem, but he was not the one who created in the first place. Many issues have been there for decades.  I do not know whom you saw in Donetsk and whether you were there at all and I'm not going to argue about that. There are numerous foreign mercenaries arriving and fighting on the Ukrainian gov't side as well (including the very same Russians by the way), not to mention all those obscure volunteer regiments with dubious authority - but you do not seem to find any problem with that somehow.  > Ready for another cauldron?  This intro gives instant hint on you character and your willfulness.  >  Shariy has integrity, and why would he need Russian money, he makes millions off his businesses and prefers to be his own boss so he can provide independent journalism. The man is a Ukrainian hero.  Ahahaha, [just look at this ""hero"" and ""journalist""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps8XnUw5Wo0&list=PLq5AvS8uUfVPS8phZSOP1BrMWt-Mh1Lf6) He even say that Crimea belong to Ukraine. How ppl call him Russian mouthpiece is fucking beyond me. Oh cheesus christ ... dont even try...  You think everybody here is an ignorant ripe to brainwash?  As if I was not close to the conflict, and didnt follow it from the beginning, and seen lots of videos from that fucking idiot who sold his soul... dude... the guy is a piece of shit with no grain of integrity who uses omission and half truths to keep up with pro-Putin propaganda. Calling him a journalist is an offense to the entire world of journalists.    Don't try to polish a turd, dude. It will still be e turd.  Get your facts straight.    refers to ethnic Russians.    refers to the people of Russia (citizens who are not ethnic Russians). Neither term describes the people of USSR or ex-USSR in general - Russia was just one of the many republics back then.   All correct and to the point.  Thanks for that. 1. Site is literally called ""proof positioning"".  2. Picture is dated 2014. Any more recent sources?  3. This photo really proves nothing. The only thing laughable is your idea that Ukraine is somehow the aggressor here. How dare they violate a ceasefire against a heavily foreign backed force that is trying to overthrow the government supported by most of Ukraine. It's hilarious because I've seen you all the time on /r/syriancivilwar talking about how evil the West is for supporting rebels. Now, I think the Syrian rebels are mostly jihadi scum, so I don't disagree with that, it's just funny how Putinbots don't realize their hypocrisy when they rush to defend Russia and Russian proxies actions in both conflicts. These separatists are as legitimate as the various Gulf and Turkey backed Syrian rebels you despise.  But hey, what do I know? Anything you dislike is just Trans-Atlantic political class propaganda, right? Nice personal attack It is, which is why I'm conflicted. You almost cannot blame the citizens for falling for the propaganda they are continuously exposed to, but on the other hand they should have some critical thinking skills to see that their government is the one that's responsible for all this garbage. Those that follow it willingly while knowing the truth, those you can hate without remorse.  They have. It's not their fault that they didn't predict that Russia would give medium range SAM systems to a bunch of hicks. That's something the US has never done. It's also worth noting that your precious Russians have lost a lot of lives in Ukraine whilst failing to establish those breakaway regions as stable permanent states, though I guess Putin doesn't really care about that. What will it possibly change? When everyone repeated Western MSM bullshit about Syria no one questioned how unarmed protesters threw their bodies against the army. Genius - Radio Free Europe is our own State-dept funded propaganda outfit. It's what we beam into Russia to get ordinary Russians to question their government and adopt our point of view. They're rather pro-Ukrainian in their outlook, and it's unlikely Putin is paying anyone to promote them. So Putin even bought RFERL? World is doomed. If only the truth was that simple. Problem is, separatist military is mostly composed of locals, and Donbass has never exactly been a bastion of Ukrainian culture. Settled under Catherine the Great after Russo-Turkish wars and all that. Shit's complicated over there. Poor devil is one who doesn't understand what is goin on in our world.  You can report my account, I absolutely dont care, just interesting what is reason of it.  As far as you gave me an advise, let me do the same. Read documents, learn history and never listen to news. You're right, but look at his comments in context. It's clear he is just re-appropriating his position. Ukrainian advances have all been within the Gray zone, something the Pro-Russians have done several times since Minsk -II  That aside, i can name more than a few failed offensives by the Separatists since Minsk II, more than the Ukrainians.  1. June 2015 Marinka (sp?) Failed offensive. No Change. 2. Jan 2017 Svitolbarsk (sp?) failed offensive. Resulted in a few gained positions by the Ukrainian Forces 3. Mid 2016 Adivika (sp?) offensive that claimed new Separatist positions in the Industrial Zone. 4. Early 2016 Grab Kominertove (sp?) Gray zone territory re-occupied by the Separatists.  Being the four major outliers  Right now as we speak the Pro-Russians are trying to land grab in Adivika.  . I'm not saying that on an objective level the Trump stories are more important than the wars in Yemen or Ukraine, but the Trump stories affect us in the West directly and are really different than anything we've experienced recently. Unfortunately, foreign wars slogging on in places most Americans couldn't point out on a map have been a constant background hum since forever.  I'm not trying to excuse our not paying attention to those things, but I think it makes a sort of sense beyond just ""Americans are assholes."" The guy that covered it even ended up imprisoned in a basement by a crazy dude that appointed himself mayor when the rebels held Slovyansk.  Still came back and kept going for a year. It is definitely a bad thing g. Slant is a slant and I see no reason why they should have had one to begin with. I'll give them credit for moderating their bias more than CNN, Guardian, WaPost and RT, but just the plain fact that they had a bias from the get-go leaves a bad taste in my mouth.   Nah, I've seen people banned for some fairly harmless shit over there.  You are clearly in the dark. /r/russia puts anyone critical of Russia on premoderation, permanently. I know several Redditors who had this experience and their posts were 100% respectful.  I once did an experiment: I created several new accounts and made each one post a slightly critical post about Putin or Russian disinformation (like MH17). I shit you not, *every single account got banned or put on pre-moderation in less than an hour and the post deleted.*  I did this over several weeks and built a posting history in each account, so it's not like they knew.  But yeah, there are many people I know who were banned from /r/russia in minutes because they dared criticize Putin.   Also: https://www.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/5a21bf/what_is_your_opinion_on_rrussia/ Yeah, after you post a shitload of articles about how Ukraine ""doesn't exist"" or how the Ukrainian language is a sham.   The usual shit.   I remember the day when /r/Russia got triggered by an April Fools joke by /r/europe.  So much salt was excavated that day.  Because of [this](http://i-army.org/). If you can't read Ukrainian or Russian, it's the ""Ukrainian Information Forces"" government website. They recruit people and everything, without even trying to hide it.  Yet somehow US and western media convinced everyone that it's Russia which has shills and internet trolls hired by the government As they should.  [Syrian president Bashar al-Assad is not a dictator - just a figurehead - according to a former British ambassador to Syria](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/assad-dictator-andrew-green-british-ambassador-syria-481269)  [Most Syrians back President Assad, but you'd never know from western media ](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/17/syrians-support-assad-western-propaganda)  [Assad Government ready to accept Kurdish autonomy in Syrian Kurdistan Minister](http://ekurd.net/assad-regime-ready-to-accept-kurdish-autonomy-in-syrian-kurdistan-2015-04-20)  [Syrian women enjoy rights and protection under the Syrian government, fear takeover by rebels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhL8D0wYevo)  [Syrian woman confronts John McCain for supporting the continuation of Syria's civil war](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6QKvuB6YkU)  [Syrian government providing aid and protection to civilians in Alleppo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebE3GJfGhfA) Don't be too mad that I've proved you wrong and that there is no ban on the Russian language.  I've lived here for 8 years. There are quite a few organizations, foreign and Ukrainian, that have trying to make things better for over a decade. It is a shit hole but there's still hope.   I know about the mercenaries and know some of them personally. The volunteer regiments have been incorporated and are under control of the Ukrainian army. NATO and U.S. forces are also here training Ukrainian troops. I have no problem with any of this.   Can't help it, Ukrainian military and the various nazi battalions want to fight again, they will be proven wrong like last time, maybe 3rd cauldron lucky? Which country are you hiding from mobilization in btw? Visiting grandma in Rostov?  Why stop there about Shariy, check if he ever threw sand at other kids when he was 6! I heard he soiled his diaper when he was 1 as well! Well, except he doesn't, he calls things as they are, he provides the full story, the bad and the good about everyone. Despite all the shit that Ukraine has put him through, he remains a true patriot, and I respect that even though I don't agree with him on his position about Crimea. I'd argue that  is a little more than an ""ethnicity"", given that many, many people former republics other than the Russian SSR refer to themselves as such. > The only thing laughable is your idea that Ukraine is somehow the aggressor here. How dare they violate a ceasefire against a heavily foreign backed force that is trying to overthrow the government supported by most of Ukraine.  > But hey, what do I know? Anything you dislike is just Trans-Atlantic political class propaganda, right?  Again, I was just pointing out an example of extreme bias in the press to a point it's so obvious it smacks you upside the head. Having followed many foreign conflicts, I'm well aware by now that the particulars for why you support this side or that are irrelevant here. If the general consensus of the political establishment in the Western bloc countries was of support for the rebels as freedom fighters, the country supplying them was a NATO state or NATO ally, and the government in Kiev was pro-Russian, you, I, and anyone with a damn scintilla of intelligence well know the headline would read something very different. Like a straightforward ""Ukrainian troops violate cease-fire"", rather than presenting the other side to it *in the actual headline itself* when such is never done in such a way for countries and sides the Western alliance states/media/political and business class opposes.  Never did I once say that RT, Sputnik, RIA Novosti, TASS or any other Russian news agency wasn't plenty biased, but as this is some dreck put out there by the Heritage Foundation in my country and a larger number of people I know are expected to believe and be propagandized by it, I'll certainly take aim at it.  > It's hilarious because I've seen you all the time on /r/syriancivilwar talking about how evil the West is for supporting rebels. Now, I think the Syrian rebels are mostly jihadi scum, so I don't disagree with that, it's just funny how Putinbots don't realize their hypocrisy when they rush to defend Russia and Russian proxies actions in both conflicts. These separatists are as legitimate as the various Gulf and Turkey backed Syrian rebels you despise.  1) I don't support a government just because it's a government or oppose rebels just because they're rebels. There are other ideological and geopolitical factors at play. Who and what that government is, what it stands for in its own country, the region and the world and who it is aligned with and aligned against - its composition as a state and foreign policy, matter a great deal. There are plenty of conflicts, contemporary and historical alike, in which I've supported rebels against a government and vice versa.  2) I'm not a ""Putinbot"", pervasive as this puerile language has become - just someone who genuinely disagrees with your opinion on this topic. There are other aspects of Russian foreign and domestic policy with which I disagree, like I could say about nearly any country.  Are you saying the plane went rogue? The conspiracy deepens, please tell more. And yes, if you believe Ukrainian media Russia lost whole football teams and swimming clubs there, not too mention many great characters from detective series. What are you talking about? Hundreds were killed in the streets and then the military got involved and half of them revolted against Assad. Do you remember what happened?  true, but they shouldn't be complaining about a ""creeping offensive"" when they are positioning artillery, building bases and deploying 10's of thousands of troops in the area. i'm not saying the article was horse shit, just the perspective on the situation.  you can't stab someone then get mad when they pull the knife out. who said that? quite a leap there bud. Well... many considering the situation of how the region became isolated and all fucked up they had no other choice than to take a weapon and go fight to receive a salary to feed their family. Many were even drafted by force under the threat of being executed for treason.  I was in the region multiple times in the first months of the conflict and they were from everywhere but Ukraine. The first ""separatists"" being killed were actualy Armenians. The only locals I saw were  alcoholics, drug addicts and criminals thirsty for looting.  Get used to life then duder. Literally every news source that has ever, will ever, or presently exists, is composed of people with opinions. The difference is between those organizations that have a slant, and those that deliberately spread misinformation and propaganda. The key to being informed isn't trusting any one organization to bring you news, because you're kidding yourself if you think any are unbiased completely  That Vice News coverage of The Ukrainian Crisis had a slant, but it didn't paint the other side as monsters nor it's own side as heroes  Man, I got banned from /r/ukraine because they were talking about how they will have Crimea back and what they'll do with it, and I asked them how they were thinking they'd get it back in the first place. The official reason the mod gave me was my vatnikness (derogatory term for Russians).  The only thing I've ever seen anyone banned for on /r/Russia was exactly what I said - hate speech and death threats. There were plenty of users who were vehemently anti-Russian but were at least civil about it, they just don't post much anymore because there isn't as much stuff going on. I regularly criticize Putin's policies on that sub and I've yet to get anything but an occasional downvote for it.  >I once did an experiment: I created several new accounts and made each one post a slightly critical post about Putin or Russian disinformation (like MH17)  So you made a bunch of new accounts, then posted crap about a heavy topic in a sub which was being brigaded by actual disinformationists creating troll accounts for this topic, and somehow you're surprised your accounts were booted out? Why would you ever expect this to play out any differently?  >Also: https://www.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/5a21bf/what_is_your_opinion_on_rrussia/  What point are you trying to make with this, that a completely pro-Poroshenko et al. sub is going to be extremely biased against anyone who doesn't hate Russia? Again, how is any of this surprising?  As far as /r/UkrainianConflict, here's my personal anecdote:  There was a story years ago about a ""Selfie Addicted Russian Soldier who posted selfies while invading Ukraine"". Of course the story wound up on /r/UkrainianConflict, where everyone was commenting on how it was absolute proof of a full scale Russian invasion. I commented with a picture of a map on which I drew distance markers, pointing out that the soldier was about a kilometer from where the post was geotagged (in Ukraine), while he was stationed in Russia. I.e. the cell tower on the Ukrainian side of the border was routing his cell.  My comment ended up being downvoted so much that it was the top comment if you sorted by controversial. A fucking map was considered controversial. /r/UkrainianConflict really likes ""Alternative facts"". https://themoscowtimes.com/news/st-petersburg-troll-factory-attacked-with-molotov-cocktails-55900  Except it's a fact? You don't live in Ukraine, nor do you speak or read Russian. Nice try, but just because something happens and there isn't an article in English so you can't read it, doesn't mean it didn't happen. I've lived in Donbass, so please, educate me further on what I don't know while you sit at home in America.  There is always hope, but saying that things are getting better  - that is simply not true. I can even tell by the standard of living my relatives have today and three years ago.   Secondly, if you have no problem with the pro-US foreign mercenaries, it is quite hypocritical of you to bitch about the Russian ones.   You say you lived there for 8 years - where did you live before? > Which country are you hiding from mobilization in btw? Visiting grandma in Rostov?  I'm ""hiding"" at home, in Kharkov, in 150 meters from recruitment office. And I really like people like you always bring this ""why you are not in ATO huh? HUH?"" The answer is simple: At first, I wasn't mobilized during active phase of mobilization, because I don't have any military specialization and guys like me are in the very end of the list usually; At second we don't have mobilization now, most of the army consist of contractors at the moment; At third, unlike fucked in the brain Russians from all regions of Russia, we DON'T want to go the the war, and I don't see anything bad or wrong to go there only after the army is calling you explicitly, for us this war is a necessary measure, not something desirable. And at forth, if you guys believe that truth is on your side, why your government deny its involvement in this war for three years? Why deny something you're so proud of? Why you bury all your soldiers who died in Ukraine either secretly or under the ""died during military drills"" legend?  >  various nazi battalions want to fight again          ... Jeez, I wonder why?   Don't tell me you didn't know about sizeable ethnic Russian minorities in other ex-republics.   I guess Moscow's migration policy paid off well in the end. I was going to direct this reply to the other user but I figured I'd direct it at you.  Part of the issue with the translation would be that in Russian the term used to describe the distinction in depth would not be ethnicity () but nationality (). This causes problems for English translations since nationality is typically treated as a synonym of citizenship, though the two are distinct concepts, and  refers to the act of belonging to a particular nation () and not which state ().  In addition to the absence of the explicit emphasis on  when using  or  when using ; with the distinction being only implicit. No, you did not give me *any* viable proofs.  You're kind of pathetic in your attempts to blame Russia for stuff it isn't even involved in. I mean, I know about the popular **#RussiansDidThis** hashtag, but you seem to take it seriously. The problem is that you only read the headline. You didn't bother to read the article at all, you just saw something you didn't like and labelled it as Trans-Atlantic propaganda. Or you did read it and decided that you'd just talk about the headline and hope that no one questioned you.  > And early Monday morning, combined Russian-separatist forces launched a predawn artillery attack and follow-on ground assault on the Ukrainian-held front-line town of Avdiivka.  > Ukrainian officials claimed the attacks were an attempt by combined Russian forces to derail the cease-fire by effectively baiting Ukraine into retaliatory actions, which could be used as an excuse for further escalations, or for propaganda.  An artillery barrage is a clear example of ""bait."" It is legitimate provocation by any stretch of the imagination. If Belgium started shelling the Netherlands, would the Netherlands be the one breaking the peace by then attacking Belgium? The title of the article is reasonable given the content of it. Unfortunately the /r/worldnews standard is to just comment based on headlines and not the content of articles themselves.  If you disagree with the actual content of the article, if you have evidence that this shelling didn't take place, et cetera, say so. If the content is propaganda, say so. As it stands you haven't disputed the content, you just whined about the headline by claiming that an unbiased headline would put sole blame on Ukraine alone. Learn how to read. ""They have"" does not imply that they had beforehand. The only conspiracies are the bullshit peddled by your beloved state media. I guess reading is hard for putinbots, as is accepting the fact that Russians are dying in a country they don't belong propping up a movement that would fail instantly without their continuous presence. Yeah, so arabs can protest against ""tyrant"" and ""killer"" without fear but slavs cannot. That's what you implied. Fucking racist. well... i guess if you're traitorous Trump or the great Satan, Putin, you can. It's not complaining - it's the reality of the situation. Like it or not, the separatists are there, and if Kiev wants things to stay quiet, it makes sense to adhere to the ceasefire. The fact that it's breaking down at the moment is on both sides - but at the same time, it's UAF who has been doing the lion's share of provocative moves lately, and the creeping offensive is largely to blame for this flareup.   Now, if you want the Ukrainians to launch an all-out assault and kick out the separatists, that's fine. But then you shouldn't mind that the ceasefire is breaking down, and accept that Ukrainians are responsible for that - from that perspective it's just seizing initiative. Can't have it both ways.  RFE's perspective is the American perspective - meaning that we'd like Minsk 2 to remain in place for the time being, and Kiev's fucking that up. Generally, RFE's editorial bent is pro-Ukrainan, but it is *always* anti-Russian. Implied in your previous comment. Oh I'm used to it brodie. I understand how media works and why the biases are ever present. However, what I disagreed with was you saying the pro-Ukraine slant wasn't a bad thing. To me the slant took away from otherwise excellent reporting, simple as that.   Now I'm not throwing a fit or telling people to boycott Vice News. I recognize that we don't live in an idealistic world and I still think highly of the Russian Roulette coverage. At the same time I have no problems voicing my dislike of the bias that they had in that series.   Growing up, recognizing biases, learning to aggregate your information from various sources is all great and important but it doesn't mean that you should stop asking for better reporting from the sources that you do like.  /r/ukraine and /r/ukraina are far worse, I'll give you that. >So you made a bunch of new accounts, then posted crap about a heavy topic in a sub which was being brigaded by actual disinformationists creating troll accounts for this topic,  Nope. I posted a single article with each account. One article was about MH17. But there were many other topics. For example one was  a video titled ""Are Europeans Really Russophobic"". It interviewed commoners on the street, debunking claims by the Russian media that Europe is Russophobic. That account was put on pre-moderation in a few hours and the thread's comments locked. There are numerous examples of that.  >What point are you trying to make with this, that a completely pro-Poroshenko et al. are going to be extremely biased against /r/Russia? Again, how is any of this surprising?  The point was to show other people's stories on how they were banned from /r/russia for innocuous comments.  >My comment ended up being downvoted so much that it was the top comment if you sorted by controversial. A fucking map was considered controversial. /r/UkrainianConflict really likes ""Alternative facts"".  The hive-mind exists everywhere. Obviously what happened was bad, But at least your account wasn't stealthily put on pre-moderation forever for that. The US has these factories too. Literally everyone does. The Ukrainian government starts a literal ""ministry of truth"" and has open recruitment to sow disinformation against Russia, and yet only the ""Russia bad"" side of it is reported. Typical. There isn't an article because it isn't a thing.  We deny the bullshit claims of 3000 tank columns entering Ukraine daily, we don't deny supplying weapons or having our volunteers attending (small percentage of total sep forces). And of course we deny spec ops presence, but that's how spec ops do.  Are you suggesting there are no battalions fighting for Ukraine made up of neo nazis? I didn't say Ukrainian military are nazis, did I, I don't call every Ukrainian nazi, just the actual nazis. Of course. They're not exactly small minorities. Hell, my grandparents were the first from our family who were born in Belarus.  ""Moscow's migration policy""? The free movement of people within the USSR isn't a ""migration policy"". Good explanation, better than mine! Out of steam already? Reinterpretive deflection and tangents.   Tell your overseer he shames the Ministry of Truth by letting his peons slack. Slavs are smarter, why get shot when you can just leave or stay quiet. No point in dying for a lost cause.  trying to appease Putin and stick to the terms of agreements has been working out so well for the world, hasn't it. that's simply your interpretation.  Pre-moderation can be turned on either by mods, or automatically if a new account goes into negative karma for that sub, which is what I'm guessing happened with the brand new accounts you made.  And quite frankly, if the mods started manually enabling pre-modderation for all new accounts posting at that time, it doesn't surprise me. I was in the sub before they made the posting rules stricter, but after MH17, and it was a clusterfuck - there were downright death threats, long rants which more or less revolved around how Russians are subhumans, blatant disinformation, and general brigading.  >The point was to show other people's stories on how they were banned from /r/russia for innocuous comments.  You're assuming these stories are true, but I don't see any of them backing up their claim. Also I'm pretty sure I recognize one or two of the names from the exact threads I was talking about before - the hate speech ones.  >your account wasn't stealthily put on pre-moderation forever for that.  It was, actually. Like I said, my map post drove me into negatives on that sub, automatically putting me on pre-mod and only allowing me to make one post every 10 minutes. Corporate entities as well. Astroturfing is a powerful tool.  Everyone does it, some are just more subtle than others.  I was just taking issue with you implying the Russians weren't doing it. Both sides is this issue are wrong here. And yet i-army is ineffective, while Savushkino troll factory employees can be found even in the most insignificant online outlets, posting the usual liquid shit about Kievan Nazi junta.   But Ukrainians are the nasty ones in this. Go figure.  Lol I literally linked you one dude > we don't deny supplying weapons or having our volunteers attending  By saying ""you"" I mean your government. They deny *any* involvement. Your authorities never acknowledged they supply so-called separatists (in fact they rather are collaborators) with ammunition, fuel etc. There is a shitton of evidences of direct involvement of the regular forces of Russian Federation Armed Forces in Ilovaysk and Debaltsevo episodes of this war, there are also evidences of cross-border shellings of Savur-Mohila from Russian territory. There are evidences that MH17 was shot down from Russian BUK which was returned to Russia in a day after the tragedy. And all these are only the most notable, obvious and wide-known facts about Russian involvement in this war, there are also way more things if we dig deeper. And your government denies it all. At the same time you people know it's not like that and you support their actions, but again, why deny what you think is a right thing to do?  > Are you suggesting there are no battalions fighting for Ukraine made up of neo nazis?  Made up completely of nazis? - No. Having plenty of such? - Yes. The only such unit is Azov. Yes, of course they have ultra-right nationalistic leaders in charge, it's a fact. However, Azov is only a tiny part of forces under control of Ministry of Internal Affairs, and what's more important is that any big country with armed forces in action have this kind of people. There are plenty of guys of same views on your side, like Milchakov and his friends, like [this one](http://argumentua.com/stati/russkii-natsizm-fashisty-vlasovtsy-i-belogvardeitsy-na-sluzhbe-dnr) (these two are only first I could googled in a heartbeat, but there are hundreds of similar ""volunteering"" scumbags from Russia here). Why don't you mention them? Any war attracts such kind of people so you have a concentration of them at one place. But it doesn't change anything in fact. We have war here. We have a certain amount of ultra-right people, some of them you might even call neo-nazis, but so does your side! And so does any big armed forces of any country in action at any war, the only difference here is that you only emphasize it for the opposite side. There are neo-nazis in Russia, in Brazil, in USA, in UK, in France, in Norway, in Japan and in any damn country on this planet. There also are neo-nazis in Ukraine in approximately same amount as in any other country nowadays. So fucking what? Was there free movement? You needed a home to live in and what I've been told by USSR family members is that the government would supply one if it wanted to, so it wasn't free movement but approved movement. Plus the USSR supported the migration of Russians into non-Russian territories like the Baltics. Sure, just keep on living in state media land in which Ukraine shot down that jet and Russia does nothing wrong. It's hilarious seeing people like you who incapable of free thought. You should probably move to Russia, you'll enjoy the AIDS and shitty economy. They also have an access to the internet, yet only Poroshenko claiming that russian troops there.

"13",12,"5r7jvs","2017-01-31","Someone needs to find a better word than ""fascist"" to describe Trump. It's being overused, overstretched, and the other side will just ignore the criticisms because of it. Really.. personally I think the surveillance laws passed by the British government are actual fascism..  People on the extreme left are saying he's literally Hitler and people on the extreme right are saying that he's a saint and can do no wrong. Then there are some people are in the middle who are thinking wtf is wrong with these people.   When a person agrees with Trump, it doesn't mean that they're a Trump supporter and when they disagree with Trump, it doesn't mean they're a 'liberal'. It was only months ago [a year ago?] that Skinner's Labour party (but not Skinner or current leader Corbyn) voted to join the bombing in Syria, justified by a barnstorming speech by their former leader's son, Hilary Benn, about how ISIS are fascists. Opposing parties disagreeing with one another. WORLDNEWS. Said the people who spared no expense in welcoming Xi Jiping, a vanguard of democracy!  regardless of my feelings about trump, this bullshit of every elected official around the world wanting to get their name placed under a ""virtuous"" headline is ridiculous. Denouncing trump through sensationalized sound bytes, meanwhile they themselves are dumpster fires. It's a cheap PR grab. Keep calling everyone you disagree with a fascist, racist, bigot.  Totally works. I remeber the time when r/worldnews was nice place,not great,but leaps and bounds better than r/news and sure as hell not garbage shithole like r/politics or r/europe.  Oh,i member.  Good times. There's A LOT of stuff people can criticize Trump over(I say this as a Trump supporter), but to label him a fascist is ridiculous.   ""Fascists believe that liberal democracy is obsolete, and they regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian one-party state as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties.""  I don't think Trump wants to get rid of democracy, and I don't think he wants a one-party state.  I wish people would stop throwing around the term 'fascist' without truly understanding the term. He's just a right-wing nut, like a lot of Republicans.  Dennis Skinner also says the European Union is a capitalist empire so..  Winston Churchill: ""The fascists of the future will call themselves the anti-fascists.""  EDIT: After 20+ upvotes, I wonder if you guys realized that I'm a Trump supporter and you are the fascists. Also, Obama hates Churchill and took his bust out of the White House. You guys are so cucked. Trump is not a fucking Fascist. Why do people keep saying this?  Tell us how you really feel Dennis. Everyone I Don't Like is Hitler; The Emotional Child's Guide to Political Discussion.. You'd think a politician would know what fascism means. The funniest part of this is that he grabbed her hand because he's afraid of ramps.  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/28/revealed-real-reason-donald-trump-theresa-may-held-hands-not/ Who cares about his opinion. He needs to put attention on the uk.  We need to be careful about the degradation of language by misuse. Racist, sexist and fascist are slowly becoming simply ""People I dislike and disagree with."" Which is kind of troubling.  It's not only Trump she supports. She also fixed a fighter planes deal with the Turkish dictator Erdogan. She does love her friendly fascists. Theresa May was hired to deliver a Brexit. Like it or not, the only way she can make Brexit work is to walk hand in hand with Trump.  Europe is pushing us towards this - we are going to get no favours from the EU and so either we do something filthy with China or we do something filthy with Trump I don't know what everyone is getting so worked up about.  I have it on good authority that Trump won't literally do all the batshit crazy shit he swore he'd do in his campaign. It only looks like he's literally doing all the batshit crazy shit he said he'd do if you look at things through the bias of sanity. Good old Boris Johnson is wrong about the Italians not bombing Britain during WWII.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpo_Aereo_Italiano  Fat bigoted men with bad hair should keep their mouths shut when honorable men are talking about war.   I'm sure Boris loves war just like Donald Trump does. Never done it but loves it when others do it for him.  Mango Mussolini was used in a thread yesterday and now I cannot unread. Remember when republicans were calling Obama the anti-Christ? This is totally different. Oh, a Labour MP calling someone a fascist. That's new.  What exactly makes him a fascist? ""Peace for our time"" - Theresa ~~Chamberlain~~ May The election showed us one thing. Above all leftists are children. They quantify everything as the end of the world. They purport hypothetical claims as facts and ignore actual facts. Anyone who is reasonably centrist has already abandoned this nonsense. Its kind of fucked up considering how many people are more scared of socialism than fascism.   What else can she do? The UK voted out of the EU. Trump and Erdogan are her lifeboats now. I'm a 20 year old person. It makes me sad to know that there are people who use word fascism that are much older than me and have no idea what it is. I'm waiting till people start calling him an alien or reptilian.  He certainly shares a lot of political traits with fascist leaders (demagoguery, espousing violence, othering of minorities, nationalism, distrust of organized labour etc.). I would say that ideologically he is not a fascist, but then ideologically he is not really anything.  May doesn't need Trump's help to be tarnished by fascism.  Everyone I don't like is literally Hitler.  It's a fact. Someone has to say it. Keep am eye on her and what she's doing here in the UK, she could be worse than Trump given the chance, she's already ignoring petitions and protests.  How is temporarily restricting travel from 7 countries identified by the previous administration as terror-prone ""fascism""? I prefer the term ""quasi-facist."" Almost there and on the path but missing a few key, incredibly horrid things. Trump is on his way to become toxic to any world politician that may want to approach the US. She is a bit of a cunt. I love me some Dennis Skinner. He worked down the pit.  There's not many of him left.  Fascism = do and believe what we say or get out.   Trump = just get the fuck out.  When you start of calling everyone you disagree with fascist and nazis there is not much else to talk about in regards to character assassination. That's it, it's over.   If calling people these names didn't work for you:  Nazis Fascists Bigots Racists Xenophobic Homophobic Islamaphobic  Then there is literally nothing else you could possibly say that would do any more ""damage"". That's it. There is no argument, because they already lost it when they switched over to insults. And there is no insult that will ""shock"" people. because they've already been calling half the entire country that same shit for 18 months now.   And we all know how that helped give us president trump in the first place. GO AT HIM SKINNER!  Well that seems more like a populist gesture to me Well I formally call him a Twat.  Oh shit, calling people names has no value to the discussion whatsoever? Damn, no wonder Hillary lost and the Brexit is happening. Everything I dont like is Hitler. Well, he's not wrong. The 'Independent' is such a horrible clickbait site.    Ask enough Labour MPs and you'll get an insult about anyone who isn't a current Communist party card carrier, and even then they'd probably call them 'soft'.  That's why they won't be voted in for the next decade at least, most of them are a bunch of useless loonies. It doesn't matter what the fuck you call him. The fact is that Trump is a danger to democracy. The cult of Trump love him above all else including their previously sacred idols of the Constitution and American Democracy. Those they previously demonized, such as Russia, are a-okay now because their new lord and savior approves. The cult of Trump, many of whom were the bible-thumping religious zealots that elected Bush, decided they no longer cared about Christian morals or ethics in their pussy-grabbing, handicapped-individual-mocking, racist and sexist leader.   Trump is a danger to American democracy, common decency, religious freedom and the security and economics of the world. He is a disaster, a farce, a fucking monstrosity of hubris and childish behavior.  ...and he's 100% right. Trump is a fucking megalomaniac - and sinister ladies of the night like Theresa May-hem can't wait to embrace his ideology - it makes me fucking sick.  I don't even consider myself british - I'm Scottish and we didn't vote for this nasty, foul, divisive shit. Britain doesn't work any more - the four nations that make it up are all very different people. Scots and English? Completely different outlooks on life - the only thing we have in common is we live on same island - we are fundamentally different peoples.  Fuck all tories - and if you voted for them then fuck you too.   Tories put self before country/community every single time. [caption](http://imgur.com/2gL0VaR.jpg) Dennis Skinner calls Trump what he is a fascist. It takes an honest man like Mr. Skinner to call a spade a spade in reference to Trump. B Johnson's response was typical arse licking Tory. The picture of PM May walking hand in hand with Trump will come back to haunt her. Neither she no Trump will last long. But honest working class Dennis, will still be there to call a spade a spade.   [removed] He's a populist nationalist. But that's not as catchy. It just so happens that coincides with limiting things the left thinks are virtuous (open borders being the most prominent aspect of his first week) which is then conflated with ""fascism"". [But I get the feeling most of these people throwing around that word haven't looked it up.](https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%2012-m&q=fascism) Fascism to begin with isnt the right word to use for him, asshole maybe but not fascist and comparing hitler to trump is like comparing ghandi to mao, ofcourse im not saying trump is ghandi, im just saying he doesn't take out his opposition and kill millions to prove a point Nationalist? Populist? [Because everyone I don't like is Hitler](https://thisaintnews.com/static/user/pics/1458172800/1458431063_Everyone-I-Don-t-Like-is-Hitler.jpg) I am Italian, I know quite a lot about the history of Fascism. I can definitely say that Trump is fascist, and the people who elected him even more. We've seen this exact stuff during the ""ventennio"".  So, keep an eye in particular for political assassinations (of any kind, professional or physical).. oh sorry, that already happened.  So, now the only thing you need is a [huge news story that distracts the people from what the government is doing (google translate is your friend)](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gino_Girolimoni) and a credible threat or alliance against that threat. You have the alliance (with Theresa May). Now all you need is some pissed off someone that triggers the suspension of constitutional rights.  And the ""best"" thing is that people will support it, and mob those who don't. Really? I think fascist is a good shortcut to describe someone who:  - Is a nationalist  - Preaches xenophobia  - Leads a mass movement, the so-called alt right  - Leads said mass movement through counterfactual propaganda  - Pits his base against intellectual elites  - Opposes the free market      - Seeks to align private business to national interests rather than nationalising      - Pursues mercantilism - Promises a national rebirth  - Rallies masses around his figure  - Is an authoritarian  The lack of an armed wing of his party is important and saving grace, as he tries to do deep reforms still within Government rather than a revolution, but he checks a lot of points by ideology and character.  Edit: points for appointing his lead propagandist to a newly made Government position, though. How about Cunt? I know Australia already uses it a lot, but as an invective, it really works. Fascist describes Trump accurately. I am a very liberal guy but I never used the word to describe Romney, McCain, gwb, or any other politician. Trump is in a category of his own but it is not a good category at all. He is a fascist.   He is race centric, overtly nationalistic (and not in a constructive way), is a pathalogical liar, is advised and surrounded by white nationalists, supresses freedom of media and expression and tries to supress criticism through violence and intimidation, seems pretty fascist to me. PRESIDENT TRUMP His rhetoric and policies are fascism by definition. I've mostly heard MSM refer to him as a populist, which is much more inaccurate IMO.  The Left uses a select few words over and over again until the word has completely lost all meaning. The word is overused in general, which means when the word is accurate, as I believe it is with Trump, it holds less power. Which, to be fair to that Politician, is probably the reason he reminded us exactly who real Fascist are before making his point. Dennis Skinner voted against those and quite vocally opposed them.  Seriously a British politician commenting about fascism?  Trumps recent EO's don't even hold a candle to some of the laws being passed in Britain right now.  The Investigatory Powers Act is the most far reaching surveillance bill ever passed by a western democracy [and barely anyone blinked an eye.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/19/extreme-surveillance-becomes-uk-law-with-barely-a-whimper) I'm not even going to get into the absurdity of the government controlling the internet by mandating 'opt-in' laws for pornographic materials or publishing a list of sex acts deemed inappropriate for recording.  The list from the past couple years alone is miles long.   Definitely. A healthy debate keeps us grounded and points out real flaws with policy. Unfortunately this race-to-the-bottom hyperbole epidemic only further divides. Thank you for a healthy dose of reality As a left-leaning moderate, I will say that the people he is appointing and surrounding himself with appear to be mostly unqualified for their positions and that his recent executive orders, although inline with his campaign promises, seem to be hastily prepared and ill-thought. I mean, Rick Perry as Secretary of Energy? Really? The guy who wanted to get rid of the department and couldn't remember its name? Bannon on his national security counsel? Really? Devos as Secretary of Education? His son-in-law as an adviser? This is textbook cronyism. Not to mention, his refusal to realistically cut ties with his financial conflicts of interests.   I'm not one to pick out everything he does and scream ""Hitler,"" but it's getting harder everyday to keep my mouth shut and hope for the best.   I'm politically moderate and even tend towards being conservative on some issues, but I've *never* been more uncomfortable with a sitting President than I am with Trump.  It's not just what he's doing, but how he and his administration are going about it. They're acting extremely callously and with absolutely no regard for basic human decency. The order on immigration was so poorly worded and so rushed out that green card holders got detained at airports initially. Legal residents were given no heads up to know they were about to be cut off from their families out of nowhere. Even some doctors found themselves unable to return to the US. Meanwhile, the only terrorist attack that happens amidst all this chaos is committed by one of his own supporters.  Then you've got Spicer literally yelling blatantly false statements at the press, Bannon telling the press to shut up, Spicer giving ominous threatening warnings to government employees who aren't totally onboard with everything Trump does, Trump instantly firing the acting AG when she questions the morality of his order even though her stated willingness to do so is one of the reasons she was confirmed (as recently revealed), etc.  I honestly haven't even scratched the surface. The above is just **from the last few days**. An entire book could probably be written on his cabinet picks and the unprecedented depth of conflicts of interest they represent. There's Trump's own totally unresolved and blatant conflicts of interest. There's the unresolved but potentially extremely serious issues with his involvement with Russia and Putin (which if true would be grounds for impeachment IMHO). There's the fact that his son-in-law is now a high-level advisor. And on and on and on.  I'm not going to say he's literally Hitler or anything like that. But I'm deeply disturbed by what's happening, and I *should* be on his side given my normal political views. Im a Progressive, I disagree with Trump 99% as the saying goes. When he pulled out of the TPP I was happy he did it, my other so called Lib friends look at me as if i just helped Hitler shovel jews into a oven.  Fuck no critical thinkers out there anymore. Censorship on both sides. Refusing to listen to reason and shutting down opposing views by labeling each other.   If you cannot name anything positive about Trump or anything negative then you need to take a step back.  This exactly,  I agree with some of Trumps policy but strongly disagree with some of his cabinet picks and all of his environmental policy.  But calling him a fascist or God emperor is just hyperbole.  In reality he is somewhere in the middle and only time will tell how good of a president he will be.  But what the left is doing right now is freaking out over everything and it is desensitizing the masses to when he actually does do something completely messed up.  Eventually the majority of people will react to serious issues as well the left is just complaining again.  And not take serious transgressions seriously.  But I'm somewhere right in the middle and hope he does a good job.  Cause we all benefit if he does.   >Skinner's Labour party (but not Skinner or current leader Corbyn)   You're right, but don't blame Skinner - there are some real divisions between the left-left wing of the party, centred around Corbyn and old-guard MPs like Skinner (whose career before he went into politics was, IIRC, in coal mining and union organising) and the centre-left wing, which responded to the limits of post-Thatcherite UK politics. 66 Labour MPs voted for the intervention, 153 against. I don't really think its fair to say that Labour voted this way or that, if anything, they voted against it.   Also it was December 2015, so about 14 months ago, in case you were wondering  Unfortunately the labour party is an absolute shell. That's why UKIP and the SNP got so popular, because they offered an alternative to the centralist Labour. To be honest if labour collapsed and allowed a REAL left-wing party to fill the gap it would be a good thing.  #DenisSkinner2020 There's no contradiction here. I think it's pretty clear that both Isis and Trump can both be reasonably described as fascistic. They're both advocates of intolerance, violence, the overturn of the existing liberal order, and authoritarianism.  Another foreign politician called Trump a name, we need to upvote this critical news to the top!  Every vocal opposition since the 1930's has called the President a fascist, but every President wasn't a fascist and every vocal opposition was wrong. They're repeating the history by being consistent in their pointlessly toothless name calling. There were plenty of objections and protests for President Xi's visit as well So when we're talking about money and security it's ""America first! Why are we spending money/accepting refugees to solve other country's problems?"" But when it's human rights it's suddenly hypocritical that American citizens are more concerned with their own Government? Before you call Dennis Skinner just another politician. I implore you to read into his history as an individual and politician.  He embodies not giving in to tradition and speaking his mind, he is not jumping on the bandwagon.  See a highlight reel of him insulting the 'rod' in British parliament. Ooooo don't forget Hitler. That's the best one. Of course it does that's how Hillary won... oh wait :/ 8 years of trump here we come! /r/worldnews was never good. This place is a cesspool of hate. Its literally worse than  YouTube comments It's sad to see r/politics allowed to seep into r/worldnews. I'd be just as annoyed if r/The_Donald took over this sub. The sad thing is that as long as the left is being so ridiculous and shrieking at everything, Trump supporters won't be able to criticize him themselves. There are a few things Trump has done that I disagree with, but I can't really say anything because we haven't gotten past whether or not Trump is a nazi and wants to put everyone in concentration camps If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck... > He's just a right-wing nut, like a lot of Republicans.  That's why the RNC didn't want to nominate him, huh. He was too much like them. He's a populist nationalist. Some of his policies coincide with the left (maternal leave, gay marriage) and some coincide with the right (strong military, abortion rights). He's going to try to enforce policies that were part of his platform because that's what he was elected on (ie what's popular). I do agree with your assessment of the fascist label though. Let's examine the signs of fascism as collated by Lawrence Britt a few years ago.  1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.   2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of ""need."" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.   3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.   4. Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.   5. Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.   6. Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.   7. Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.   8. Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.   9. Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.   10. Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.   11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.   12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.   13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.   14. Fraudulent Elections - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.  EDIT: removing incorrect doctorate! >""Fascists believe that liberal democracy is obsolete, and they regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian one-party state as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties.""  Except that stage of fascism comes much later, first you have to assert yourself firmly as a dictator. Even Hitler came to power with the support of a coalition of parties and he didn't become the dictator till the reichstag fire incident.   Fascists are racists to the core, are uber nationalistic, supress freedom of speech and rights of citizens which trump is doing pretty well right now. Heck, his main advisor is Bannon, a hard right wing wife beating cunt who now wields real power in the white house.  You do understand its origins right?  Maybe because it is? is he wrong? ""The Indians need to starve to death to keep their numbers under control.""  -Also Churchill I heard you loud and clear before the edit. Mind blown that Churchill said that.  I could find no evidence that it's actually a quote from Churchill.   https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talk:Winston_Churchill#The_fascists_of_the_future_will_be_called_anti-fascists  Where's your source? The left are not fascists either. Tho they are certainly obnoxious as fuarck. Because it's easy to say and it sounds cool. I would love to hear one of these comments about ""nobody knows what fascism is"" to give an actual definition of fascism. Every one I've ever heard sounds eerily reminiscent of Trump (and not necessarily Republicans generally). Please enlighten me  He does, often, and gets kicked out for it Ummmmmm...  Not all fascists are hitlers... Like not all communists are Russian soldiers... It's a buzzword. The Labour party has to use them to get headlines. He's talking about the impact of Trump on the UK though? Surely you wouldn't have commented without knowing the full story...      Also he's famous for never having missed a Commons session in 37 years as an MP. You'd struggle to find anyone more attentive to their nation than Dennis Skinner.  Germany sold 76.4 million of military equipment to Turkey in the first 6 months of 2016, which is a similar value to the UK deal. I don't recall reddit making the same noise about that.   http://www.euractiv.de/section/sicherheit/news/ruestungsausfuhren-deutschland-verzehnfacht-export-von-kleinwaffenmunition/ > friendly fascists  *I'm a tyrant that you should trust, and you should let me run your life - because I do know what is best for you.* You're pushing yourselves towards this, the EU owes you no favours or special treatment especially after the special treatment the UK had already received as a member. > Europe is pushing us towards this  How is Europe pushing you to do anything when you are the ones who choose this in the first place? Yes it's totally different but because the Republicans did it, that means it's alright if we do it and ramp it up to 11 right? Good question.  You will get crickets. He s-said bad things about the womens! LIDERALLY HIDLER!!! The right hates socialism just as much... This Trump derangement syndrome reminds me of the similar Obama derangement syndrome from the right in 2008. They thought he was going to throw everyone into FEMA work camps and he was a secret Muslim socialist. Fascism = Italy in WWII Socialism = Germany in WWII  Yea, what do people have to fear from socialism  The definition of fascism is ""an authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing system of government"". President trump is ruling by decree through executive order, aka authoritarian, his policies nationalistic and right wing. I mean, you can try to argue that his policies are the better choice, but unless you want to redefine what it is to be fascist it's hard to argue that label. But how do you rationalize when he said   >""We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow. A new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights and heal our divisions.  >It's time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget, that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.  >We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms and we all salute the same great American flag.  >And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the wind-swept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they will their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator.  That doesn't count?  But the people behind him though Are you *that much* of a deluded moron with such a failed life that you honestly believe white people are persecuted against?   To borrow from you idiots, let me lick your salty KKK tears.  Fascist doesn't mean Nazi...  The fact it denied rights garunteed to people with visas and green cards?  The fact there was deportation without an immigration hearing?  The fact that the right to an attorney was denied?  The definition of fascism is ""an authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing system of government"". President trump is ruling by decree through executive order, aka authoritarian, his policies nationalistic and right wing. I mean, you can try to argue that his policies are the better choice, but unless you want to redefine what it is to be fascist it's hard to argue that label. ""on his way""? Dude he's been a toxic asshole for 40+ years. Just look closer at the long list of people who have worked for him, or against him, and what you'll find are mostly people that have horrible things to say about him. He's a brash asshole who enjoys hurting people who are smaller than he is. He's literally the world's biggest asshole now. > Fascism = do and believe what we say or get out. >  >  > Trump = just get the fuck out.    Except for the part where you have to get the fuck out *if you don't do what he says you should do*. You know just over half of the current Tory MPs wanted to remain right? The current malaise of British politics is far more complex than just which party they're in. Both major parties are on the brink of civil war. Yeah, that from a guy who openly admired Mussolini, and advocated for crimes against humanity.   >*Italy is a country which is prepared to face the realities of post-war reconstruction. It possesses a Government under the commanding leadership of Signor Mussolini which does not shrink from the logical consequences of economic facts and which has the courage to impose the financial remedies required to secure and to stabilise the national recovery.*  --[Winston Churchill, 1926](http://www.winstonchurchill.org/publications/finest-hour/finest-hour-extras/the-creeds-of-the-devil-churchill-between-the-two-totalitarianisms-1917-1945-2-of-3)  >*The unnatural and increasingly rapid growth of the feeble-minded and insane classes, coupled as it is with steady restriction among all the thrifty, energetic and superior stocks constitutes a national and race danger which is impossible to exaggerate. I feel that the source from which the stream of madness is fed should be cut off and sealed before another year has passed.*  ...  >*I propose that 100,000 degenerate Britons should be forcibly sterilized and others put in labour camps to halt the decline of the British race.*   --[Winston Churchill, 1910](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill)   >comparing republicans to Hitler since the Clinton era  It's been going on much longer than that, [here's a picture of a protester implying Nixon is a Nazi.](https://apictureofpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/vietnam-6.jpg)  Calling people ""Hitler"" or ""Fascist"" for decades has only caused everyone to take those terms lightly. When you call a person ""Hitler"" and they turn out to be not that bad, then what you're really doing is sending people the message that ""Hitler probably wasn't that bad"" which over decades is going to desensitize people to the horrors that Hitler caused.  Fascist and Hitler aren't synonymous   I keep telling my liberal friends that their hyperbole is hurting their cause, but they continue to act as if everyone they mildly disagree with is the anti-christ. I dislike Trump too, but exaggeration kills credibility, and the faux outrage over immigration after they spent 8 years turning a blind eye to the stuff Obama was pulling (drones, nsa, drug war, whistleblowers) just makes the entire thing seem like a partisan tantrum.  I have no doubt that Trump will make some big fuck ups over the next 4 years, so we don't need to manufacture outrage over every single thing he does. We don't need to take everything he says in the worst possible context (especially since the actual context is usually bad enough), and not everyone he has surrounded himself with is a racist, sexist, bigot... although I'm sure some are.  The left could benefit a lot from a little more objectivity and honesty in their attacks on Trump. Don't stop attacking him, just don't twist the narrative or embellish when it isn't necessary. They also compared Bernie to hitler in the wikileaks. Its basically the establishment dems go-to tactic when they're worried they might lose. Wait you mean to tell me the guy that is pro Isreal and pro gays ISN'T Hitler?! WOW YOU MUST BE A RACIST NAZI YOURSELF!! /S Worldnews: ""Communist calls political opponent a Fascist!""  7000 upvotes!!!  You say this like somehow the Hitler comparison is a democratic-specific thing.  Neither political party has any sort of monopoly on hyperbole or radical rhetoric. Actually, they still don't understand the link between Trump's rise to power and their history of labeling everything and everyone right of center with nasty monikers. It's still hyperbole. They didn't say a word when Obama killed hundreds of innocent people with drones, but stop people from traveling for 90 day, which doesn't actually kill anyone, now that's evil! Maybe, but this is a UK MP and to my knowledge no one in parliament has referred to any president as a fascist in my lifetime. American politicians might have been guilty of hyperbole, but that's a separate point.  He's not really a good fascist.. trying to bring term limits to congress is the opposite of what a fascist would do. I'd consider myself socialist but I understand that open borders isn't an amazing idea Linking the definition of the word might have been a bit more useful than the google trends page...  **Fascism**  * an authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing system of government and social organization. * (in general use) extreme right-wing, authoritarian, or intolerant views or practices. Your American ""left"" are conservatives to us in the UK. Your whole country ia filled with cons and neo cons. I never understood why being a nationalist all of a sudden became ultra right fascist. Being a nationalist is about protecting your nations culture and sovereignty. > populist nationalist  That's not too far from national-populist, itself being close to the original agenda of the original national-socialist party. Let's not forget this party came to power legally in Germany.  Heck, even his slogan ""America First"" is taken from the sympathisers to the nazi cause in the 1940's. This one I think is a naive mistake, but you've got to admit there are some telltale signs.  [.. you sure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#Definitions)?  > .. a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion  Obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, and victimhood? Check.  Compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity? Check.  Working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites? Check.  Abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion? Check. Funny you say that, because Gandhi was a Nationalist.  >comparing hitler to trump  Where did that come from? Hitler isn't the only fascist in history, you know, he's just the very worst of them.  I think it's abundantly clear that Donald Trump *is* a fascist, by any objective definition of the term. He's an authoritarian. He's a nationalist. He's an anti-establishment radical. He expresses unconcealed hostility towards minorities, intellectuals, the media and the judiciary. He has no time for legal process or checks and balances and seeks to rule, in the first instance, through strong-man executive power. Add all that up and it yells 'fascist'.  That **does** mean that I disagree profoundly with him and would support any lawful means to prevent him exerting power and ultimately to remove him from his office.  It **doesn't** mean I think he's literally about to start gassing Jewish people. Fascism doesn't require genocide. Trump is 100% a fascist. He meets all of the criteria.  Ghandi to Mao has a much broader disparity then Trump to Hitler. Mainly because the poles are not so diametrically opposed in the latter's case. Ghandi did not issue executive orders (how can anyone associate mass executive orders with any semblance of a Democracy or Republic? I understand other presidents have done it, but how is unchecked executive authority not like a dictatorship?), and fire dissenting view points. Your analogy breaks down with any real inspection.  Edit: Ghandi also was supported by the majority of people in India, as opposed to less then %30 of people voting for Trump (%27). Which is more akin to how Nazi's took power, using just enough of the popular vote to take hold of an economically tumultuous government. (Sound familiar?). I'm not saying Trump is a Nazi. But he is by far more a Nazi then Ghandi.  Hitler isnt the only example.  Look at Franco how does he oppose the free market when he just signed an EO saying to remove 2 regulations for every regulation out into place? Yet he incourages gay rights and most importantly SUPPORTS the 2nd amendment which, if you don't know about history but a lot of REAL fascists leaders opposed an armed population.  The best estimates of the number of alt-right individuals during the last election cycle is somewhere [around 50,000](http://www.redstate.com/streiff/2016/11/21/yes-alt-right-exists-can-say/). Virtually all of them are on Reddit, however.  It's hard to say that this is a ""mass movement"" if it amounts to a mid-sized town in Alabama. ""Oi, he's a good cunt!"" >is advised and surrounded by white nationalists  Is that a joke? Bar one or two guys, his whole cabinet looks like a Goldman Sachs venue.  >nationalism is ethnic nationalism!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1  he endorses civic nationalism - something the rest of the world does but apparently it's a terrible thing for the EU and NA to do. > supresses freedom of media and expression and tries to supress criticism through violence and intimidation  Huh? Except none of those things are really true except being nationalistic. How is he race centric, what white nationalists, what suppression of media which criticizes him relentlessly, probably more than any other President in the US history. What intimidation and violence - throughout his campaign and so far Presidency the violence has come almost exclusively from the left. Yeah those Libtard, bleeding heart, socialist, SJW, communists... wait.  You think this is exclusive to one side of the political spectrum??  o.O I've argued this point for months with all 'hysteric' terms... homophobia, sexism, xenophobia etc etc etc. They've all be yelled so much that they've become meaningless and much more likely to be ignored when someone is genuinely worthy of such tags. Which is (I believe) linked to the rise of Trump and Brexit... though it would take a bit of time to explain which I've not got right now. Dennis Skinner is a ledge. [Dennis Skinner has a record of voting against surveillance, though.](https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/10544/dennis_skinner/bolsover/divisions?policy=6721)  You have absolutely no idea what Dennis Skiiner is about, do you? Yeah, as a Trump supporter, it's essential that we criticize our president. With this division, most Trump supporters just completely ignore the left's bitching even if there is merit to it. It's kinda scary how divided this 4 years is gonna be. I wish there was such thing as healthy debate on reddit, reddit is too one sided and doesn't care about facts. This is why i don't believe anything i read on reddit as its very clear its biased af and coming from one side only, downvote fairies keep posts that make sense down before coming to the front page, i go out there and research facts myself. Free speech my ass Don't forget the constant attacks on the media.  Once you get people to stop believing the news, you can basically start doing whatever you want without the people acting as a check.  That's basically the only thing that really scares me so far. Well IMO, when it comes to Perry, Texas is a big energy producer considering the oil and iirc they lead the country in environmentally conscious energy production. (May be wrong) >But what the left is doing right now is freaking out over everything and it is desensitizing the masses to when he actually does do something completely messed up.  What do you think they should be doing? Wait for him to allow a major terrorist attack through? Wait for him to declare martial law? He's already lying about mass voter fraud and how many people were swept up in his travel ban. He's giving a white supremacist with no qualifications more input on national security than the armed forces and intelligence communities combined. He's forced scientists to stop sharing information and left vital departments critically understaffed.  People will die because of his negligence. Why do you think people should stay silent about that? Ah thanks, I recall now that he narrowly lost the leadership contest. Unfortunately I doubt Dennis Skinner will be running in the next general, he's 84 now so will be well past 90 by the time that term is done. Labour got a real left leader in Jeremy Corbyn and they've never been lower in the polls.  Conservatives are just over 40%, Labour are trailing at 25% and sinking [removed] I too remember when reddit exploded in anti Chinese government sentiment.   Haha no The story being discussed is about a UK politician not an American... No, no, that's too heavy handed. You need to subtlety allude to Hitler, but make it quite clear what you are trying to say. ""That reminds of what this small right-wing nationalistic government did in 1930's Germany...""  if reddit was around during Hitler: ""HE IS GASSING THE JEWS BECAUSE THEYRE DOING BAD THINGS IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT LEAVE"" Tulsi 2024! 16.  Ivanka is a Trump too. Neither do I. It has been dogshit for at least 5 years. Exactly,its was like confort middle ground. r/WorldNews is basically the best news place on Reddit right now, you've got half of r/politics and r/the_donald here making points and counter points and neither side gets completely overwhelmed.  It's kinda how a politics or news sub should actually be. That is the worst take I have ever heard. ""I can't comment this man cause some people are saying mean things about him. It wouldn't be fair""  >Trump supporters won't be able to criticize him themselves.   If one thing has been made abundantly clear, it's that Trump supporters are in it for the entire package. They want him to do all this outrageous stuff. They love it, and the angrier liberals get, the more they are convinced that he is doing it right. He will never be criticized by his supporters until their jobs/finances are negatively affected. Trump isn't a nazi. Bannon is supported by the neo nazi movement but is just a nationalist xenophobe.   but they are both fascists. Mussolini and Hirohito were fascists without the whole extermination of other races thing. Both did also view non-italian/japanese people as inferior though. But then again, hard to argue that Bannon doesn't do the same, ant trump definitely fixates on the middle east as ""bad"".  Nazis? no. supported by the american neo-nazis? yes. Fascists? yes. > Some of his policies coincide with the left  I agree, that's why I think the left should focus on him delivering on those policies, like Sanders is doing, rather than call him stupid names. Didn't he loose the popular vote? They didn't want him because they thought they couldn't control him.   They quickly learned that he'll do anything for people who compliment him and that he repeats whatever the last person he spoke to says so they think he's still useful. > Dr. Lawrence Britt  ... Is not a doctor, has not published anything peer reviewed, and is in fact merely a retired businessman. Just a heads up, Laurence Britt isn't a doctor, nor is he a political scientist. He's a former business exec. He worked for Mobil, Xerox, and Allied Chemical.   [Here's a link where Laurence Britt actually shows up to discuss the points.](https://www.ryananddebi.com/2004/10/16/laurence-britts-14-points-of-fascism/) He wrote these 14 points about GW Bush btw.  [Here's a very long breakdown by someone who disagrees with him.](http://therightstuff.biz/2014/01/22/fascism-no-one-a-response-to-dr-laurence-britt/) 1. The US has been displaying flags, pledging allegiance etc long before Trump.   2. Previous administration have allowed torture; Obama expanded extra judicial killings and drone strikes.   3. Terrorism (the enemy) has been on the cards since 9/11, and has been used up until this day as an enemy identifier.   4. The U.S. has the highest military budget on the planet: it has been authorised by Liberal and Conservative governments alike.   5. This is open to interpretation, but abortion sticks out for the Trump Administration. But, he has also employed female staff.   6. The media is almost entirely against Trump, and is in no way controlled by him.  7. See previous governments since 9/11.      8. Religious rhetoric is not exclusive to Trump.    9. It looks as if he's actually taking away exploitative powers from corporations.   10. He met with Unions, something Republicans have not done to the best of my knowledge.      11. I've not come across any Academia under attack.   12. The Patriot Act was written by Joe Biden, and re-signed under Obama. It's not an exclusive right wing policy.   13. Trump has employed friends into his cabinet, but rampant corruption and cronyism I've yet to see.   14. I've not see any evidence of fraudulent elections.  Edit: Formatting. > Let's examine the signs of fascism as collated by Dr. Lawrence Britt a few years ago.  Cool, let's see what Dr Dre has to say on the matter next. List has been the same for decades. Life is still pretty damn good for most and definitely improving year over year.  This sounds as much like Hillary as it does Trump. If only there had been a third choice... In fact, this just sounds like America since the 70s. Many of those signs could also point towards communism and socialism as well. 1. Solidifying of national power including power over national healthcare  2. Blocking the religious from objecting to something on religious grounds that they don't want to do and forcing them to do it anyways. Mass murder of unborn children.   3. Declaring that a political opposing party is nothing but ""deplorable"" persons. ""I'm with her!!"" ""Change"" we are fighting against the oppressors.  4. Massive expansion of federal police powers and intrusion of federal prosecutors into state police affairs. As well as ""militarization of police"" including the secret service buying hundreds of assault rifles, night vision, ammo and body armor. Extensive use of military drones to surveil US citizens in the US, even more usage of drones bombing overseas targets. Strict control over the military and constantly firing or having secretary of defenses quit because they won't do exactly what you tell them to do.   5. Coercing the military to lower standards and to accept females in combat roles, against the advice of pretty much every single advisor.   6. Democrats feeding a candidate political questions. Democrat mayor Bloomberg owning media outlets. Very clear media bias towards the democrats/views. Obama ignoring particular media outlets and reporters and courting as well as doing one on one interviews with reporters who did what the White House wanted. His administration being notoriously difficult to work with with the press, especially if they felt you wronged them.  7. Larger and more far reaching surveillance bills and usage. As well as attempts to force a private company to hack into someone's personal phone for ""homeland security."" All while professing it was going to be the most transparent presidency, while at the same time denying more FOI requests than anyone else. Ever.   8. Science is the religion of choice for Democrats. You believe it unquestionably or you are doomed to hell and unworthy to even be talked to.   9. NAFTA, TPP, Hillarys donors were large heads and corporations. To Bill when he was in office, to the Clinton foundation and to her campaign.   10. TPP again, NAFTA again. More union jobs were lost in the past 15 years to NAFTA than to anything else. Full time, well paying jobs are replaced with multiple and part time jobs.  11. The arts thing doesn't really make sense. Nazis commissioned a lot of art projects. But, whatever. Pretty [Facist] ( http://www.posterartusa.com/images/17631_106_hi_res_.jpg) appearing if you ask me. Republicans as a whole value collegiate education. Some of the best schools in our nation are public funded universities in heavily republican controlled states.   12. Obama was constantly talking about crime and punishment and getting people out of prison. And wanted to ban guns in order to ""prevent crime"", and make other weapons charges carry more weight of punishment  13. His whole cabinet was stuffed full of people who had almost or zero political experience. They were people he placed in there himself. And were known to be fiercely loyal and closed circle that resented outside input.  14. Several Detroit precincts reported more votes than registered voters. It was a short blip and then suppressed by the favorable liberal media. As well as there are always lots of claims that illegal voters are voting and voting democrat. And they always oppose even the most basic requirements to vote, such as a state ID that is extremely easy to obtain.   So yeah. I can see your point. Thanks man.  The current tory goverment in the UK ticks a lot of these boxes. 14, 12, 11, 4 and 8 would be missed. At least from my POV. If the shoe fits, right? Liberal Fallacy Machine in full working order I see Barring #14, that doesn't really sound specific to Trump, hell it sounds like what America has been like for decades. Not just America either. And its certainly not just specific to fascism. I'm no europhile but that's a wee bit strong don't you think? Yeah, and [Hillary Clinton called black youth ""super-predators""](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/28/reince-priebus/did-hillary-clinton-call-african-american-youth-su/). I'm willing to admit that everyone makes mistakes, but please don't go pretending Winston Churchill wasn't a great man. If you truly believe that, I don't think you're well-educated on him. Churchill told me. One party one government with complete control over your speech, money, religion, assembly.  Government controls everything.  Controls the media controls the arts, controls business, controls the religions.  Tell me how trump is a fascist now? Really makes you think WORDS!!! FEELINGS!!!! UGHHHHHHH!!!!! HIDLARR! Fair point are you seriously claiming that Nazi Germany wasn't a fascist state?  edit: I see what your getting at but you're missing the point. A socialist society wouldn't get that way without a fascist dictator/administration. Obama did this with Iraqi's in 2013. Was it fascism as well? > Except for the part where you have to get the fuck out if you don't do what he says you should do.  He wants America to be full of people who want to be Americans, so that's not surprising. I have been saying this for a while now and couldn't agree with you more.  If we really mean ""never forget,"" wanting to prevent the horrors of the Holocaust from ever being repeated, then we can't use the words ""Nazi"" and ""Hitler"" to demonize any ol' person we dislike.  Also, the perfunctory default to such word usage indicates, at least to me, a lack of creativity and critical thought. Everyone has been comparing every group to nazis and every leader to Hitler, that they haven't liked, for a long time. Even Fox News had people directly on TV with damn chalk boards trying to explain how Obama was like Hitler (Glenn Beck). Just because this happens a lot does NOT mean it is a part of a greater strategy. People are quick to put down those they dislike and they often make harsh accusations in the process.   Edit: A word Very much this. Hitler/Nazi comparisons are the dick jokes of politics. They're minimum effort and contribute nothing to a discussion. It obviously worked against the Clinton machine this time around. The same attacks were recycled from the 90s and the younger generation ate it up without questioning it, inevitably bringing us to the ""both parties are the same"" dialog. I believe the issue is that some people identify Nazis as the measure of evil. This pretty much the standard moral unit, the popular culture spreading thus view since the second world war.  And so vilifying others is to make the argument as emotionally appealing as possible it has to invoke the gravest danger of the absolute evil. It is anti-christ for some deeply religious people, and for less inclined it is a figure who is identified as the absolute evil: Hitler, Stalin, Bin Laden, etc.  The best would be to get rid of the absolutist views on history and politics and be more reasoned and look for motives and room for actions Hilter was also a great leader. Sure he did horrible things, but that doesn't make one bad at being a leader. You realize that republicans have called democrats the same thing for years, correct?  https://www.google.com/search?espv=2&rlz=1C1CHMO_enUS570US570&biw=1600&bih=882&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=Hillary+is+Hitler&oq=Hillary+is+Hitler&gs_l=img.3...10871.12676.0.12724.12.12.0.0.0.0.161.869.4j4.8.0....0...1c.1.64.img..4.4.432...0j0i24k1.cauhiS1nmUU  https://www.google.com/search?q=Obama+is+Hitler&espv=2&rlz=1C1CHMO_enUS570US570&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjMvKrogu3RAhWjwFQKHf1KAcQQ_AUICSgC&biw=1600&bih=882   https://www.google.com/search?q=Bill+Clinton+is+hitler&espv=2&rlz=1C1CHMO_enUS570US570&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj4zcjwgu3RAhVohlQKHdO3AugQ_AUICCgB&biw=1600&bih=882  You will not find a US president in recent history that was not called Hitler.  My personal favorite are the tea party ads: http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/politics/2010/07/13/iowa-tea-party-billboard-compares-obama-hitler/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/876/493/1421910924462.jpg?ve=1&tl=1  This last one is a bit ironic, don't you think? True, Hitler was a fascist but not all fascists are Hitler. I've actually wondered when people will realize this. The media and people freaking out over the tiniest things are kinda blowing their wads early. In a month people will be tired of their shit and just ignore them or even worse openly oppose them. If they picked their battles they'd be more effective. Hitler, fasiscm every Republican is, albeist, racist, sexist homophobic bigot, that's Democrats strategy 101 ""Dont want single payer healthcare? well thats because youre a greedy monster and no other reason""  Democrats I heard obama=antichrist a lot more than hitler [They certainly make the most use out of it.](http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/262157/every-republican-presidential-candidate-hitler-daniel-greenfield)   [removed] Both political parties do it. But the Democrats do it EVERY time they open their mouth right now. Every criticism is ""fascism, racism, sexism, xenophobia.""  And they have 90% of the media. So their words drive further and are repeated more often. [removed] Any UK politician who did that is ignorant. America has checks and balances in place to prevent facism from ever existing in the first place. Whats happening is that America has a president who is using *all* of the powers he has and for a world who is used to gridlock, change is scary.  But its not facism. Thats offensive.  Yeah and communists wouldnt push forward a health care plan that would strengthen the business of for-profit insurance companies.  But god damn if i wasnt told the ACA was communist legislation. Eh, considering it would strengthen lobbyists I don't see how term limits weakens the economic elite of the country  If anything, congressional term limits make the POTUS stronger. Really? It'd drastically weaken the efficacy of the legislative branch, putting more into the executive. Then you blame the legislative branch for not getting enough done, propose a way to ""stop the gridlock..."" It's a wonderful first step to a transformation into an autocracy. Karl Marx agreed with you, as does any socialist that has a decent understanding of the ideology in my opinion. Open border world was for when the world had had a socialist revolution. Marx talked about the exploits of immigration under a capitalist system and how this would not only be bad for the migrant but also the workers in the area.   Solidarity with the migrants already in the country is one thing (making sure everyones paid properly etc) but open borders for the sake of ""internationalism"" is a mistake when its not applied properly.   Not until stronger workers rights or equality has been achieved under capitalism can the migrant not be open to exploitation from the employer. I don't think open borders is a defining aspect of contemporary liberalism, either. If I had to chose a sticking point for what we have today, it'd be the redistribution of wealth. Lets try the real definition:  **Facism**  often capitalized :  a political philosophy, movement, or regime (as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition  a tendency toward or actual exercise of strong autocratic or dictatorial control <early instances of army fascism and brutality  J. W. Aldridge>  [Source](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fascism) In government, no, he's not there yet. Ideologically? Yeah, he's just about there.  http://www.oldamericancentury.org/14pts.htm  Here's a helpful link which goes over the 14 points of fascism. ~~ALL~~ (actually, correction, a majority) of these traits have been exhibited by Trump. And before you accuse me of finding a link that was created *for* Trump, this was back in 2003. That's a real shitty definition of fascism.  I assume you got that definition from special-snowflake.com. I have Mussolini and Gentile's Doctrine of Fascism at home, along with Mao's quotations and the Communist Manifesto. Guess what? This google trends definition is bullshit that doesn't even cover half of it. > Fascism  > * an authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing system of government and social organization. * (in general use) extreme right-wing, authoritarian, or intolerant views or practices.  He fits both these definitions. The only question is - how many similarities are there between his actions and Fascist dictators' actions? Funny thing is that the google definition is different from the definition from most dictionaries.  Look it up with [Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fascism)   > often capitalized :  a political philosophy, movement, or regime (as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition  Most definitions don't include ""right wing.""  A few specify that fascists governments tend to be right wing, but ti doesn't mean all right wingers are fascists and it doesn't mean left wingers can't be fascist.  I think after 8 years of Obama there is far more evidence to claim he is a fascist than Trump.  NSA spying, whistle blowers sent to jail, highest number of executive orders, drone strikes against Americans.  While the worst thing people can say about Trump so far is that he is following through on all of his campaign promises. I didn't know that Stalin and Mao were right-wing from how they took people's guns, respected property rights, pushed for small govt, free speech, and had government planned economies. Really? I consider myself a leftist American. I support UBI and socialism\* in general. Single-payer healthcare, high taxes on the wealthy, general redistribution of funds to make education at all levels available to anyone qualified, forward-thinking approaches to climate change, end of oil subsidies, funding of basic research, etc.  Am I really a conservative to you? I feel that I'm a fairly typical Sanders supporter, and you should consider that he had very significant support from Democratic voters despite not even being part of that party.  \*Edit: For clarity, what I meant here is *social democracy* which I place under the umbrella of socialism. I understand you may disagree on the use of socialism that way. If it bothers you, consider my statements to be about social democracy only. It's still a leftist idea. Your British ""right"" are socialists to us in the US. Your whole country is filled with commies and pinkos.      Anyone can do this shit. [I would read George Owell's notes on nationalism (not to be confused with patriotism):](http://orwell.ru/library/essays/nationalism/english/e_nat)  > By nationalism I mean first of all the habit of assuming that human beings can be classified like insects and that whole blocks of millions or tens of millions of people can be confidently labelled good or bad(1). But secondly  and this is much more important  I mean the habit of identifying oneself with a single nation or other unit, placing it beyond good and evil and recognising no other duty than that of advancing its interests. Nationalism is not to be confused with patriotism. Both words are normally used in so vague a way that any definition is liable to be challenged, but one must draw a distinction between them, since two different and even opposing ideas are involved. By patriotism I mean devotion to a particular place and a particular way of life, which one believes to be the best in the world but has no wish to force on other people. Patriotism is of its nature defensive, both militarily and culturally. Nationalism, on the other hand, is inseparable from the desire for power. The abiding purpose of every nationalist is to secure more power and more prestige, not for himself but for the nation or other unit in which he has chosen to sink his own individuality.  > It is also worth emphasising once again that nationalist feeling can be purely negative. There are, for example, Trotskyists who have become simply enemies of the U.S.S.R. without developing a corresponding loyalty to any other unit. When one grasps the implications of this, the nature of what I mean by nationalism becomes a good deal clearer. A nationalist is one who thinks solely, or mainly, in terms of competitive prestige. He may be a positive or a negative nationalist  that is, he may use his mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating  but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs and humiliations. He sees history, especially contemporary history, as the endless rise and decline of great power units, and every event that happens seems to him a demonstration that his own side is on the upgrade and some hated rival is on the downgrade. But finally, it is important not to confuse nationalism with mere worship of success. The nationalist does not go on the principle of simply ganging up with the strongest side. On the contrary, having picked his side, he persuades himself that it is the strongest, and is able to stick to his belief even when the facts are overwhelmingly against him. Nationalism is power-hunger tempered by self-deception. Every nationalist is capable of the most flagrant dishonesty, but he is also  since he is conscious of serving something bigger than himself  unshakeably certain of being in the right.  (These are just a couple of paragraphs I selected, I would read the whole thing if you have time.) There are many ways of being a nationalist. Bernie wanted to break up international monopolies and encourage local businesses, and in that sense he was nationalist. But he never demonized minorities, ""outsiders"", and other groups with no real power, and this is what lead to Trump being labelled extreme right and fascist (also Trump's anti-science, anti-intellectual attitude, sexism, etc. etc.) Because the argument of ""protecting"" one's country has been used to horrifying actions in the past, such as Japanese internment camps.   Protecting one's nation is all well and good in itself, but it can be taken too far.  Trump is pushing that envelope by causing legal citizens to get stranded in foreign countries for routine visits to family with this ban.  He's gone back and forth on arguing for a complete ban on people based on their religion (Muslim) and several people in his administration who have a lot of sway in his decision making, such as Steve Bannon have gone further with that rhetoric by likening Muslims to a cancer on the earth.   Calling out radical Islam is rational and I don't think anyone here wants to invite in those who would do us harm, but we need to maintain perspective to understand that being Muslim is not the same as being a radical Islamic terrorist. Because hyperbole.  Attention spans have been shrinking from media over-saturation for at least 15 years or more, if someone isn't being completely hyperbolic and hysterical then no one pays attention to them. > Let's not forget this party came to power legally in Germany  Debatable. The NSDAP eliminated or suppressed a lot of the political opposition. While they were in fact voted in, to say it was a fully legitimate election is debatable. By that same logic Bernie is close to being a fascist because he is a socialist which is halfway to being a national socialist Nationalist and fascist are very very different But the news *are* political hacks.  I'm not going to pretend anyone is capable of complete neutrality, but the media isn't even trying anymore.  In my view, they are the ""opposition party"" because they are the PR wing of the Democratic Party, if only in spirit and not in name.  It's always been that way, the news organizations have always had their own political views and agendas.  It's more recently that we've had them adopting a near consensus of left wing politics.  Fox news is the token right wing news organizations in a sea of homogeneous left wing news outlets.    The ""liberal news media"" (so called for decades now, hardly controversial) needs Fox in the same way a stereotypical white dude needs a black friend, so they can claim ""see, we're not a monoculture, look at Fox here, those right wing rascals, haha, this political consensus is totally organic, trust us"" much in the same way as Joe Whiteguy can claim ""I'm not racist, I have black friends!""  You would believe Joe, why are you believing CNN? Lets agree to dis-agree, i personally dont like trump but he isn't attacking me and im a American/Arab, i don't agree with everything he does and i think there are deffinetly better people to be in charge but i just don't think he is a fascist, he hasn't threatened to take my citizenship away, i have nothing to fear from him so far, when he targets me or Americans with Arab blood then i have concern and will believe he is a fascist but for now i don't think he is this major fascist people make him to be and i know i dis-agree with you and that will lead to negative karma but open discussion is always good Lol go learn some history. Trump is certainly a dumbass and a political amateur, but he is a considerable ways off from the fascist regimes of the 20th century. And yet, his plan is to impose heavy tariffs to force US businesses to relocate to US soil, make foreign goods uncompetitive to the point that local manufacture can reappear to some degree, besides generally curtailing free trade and the flow of labour. That's interventionism on a much higher level than limits on particulate matter emissions or the like that may hamper the heavy industry he has promised to resurrect. Isn't that the dumbest thing you have ever heard?  I mean at a point you are removing regulations you put in just to put in more regulations.  What idiot thought that up? He doesn't encourage gay rights. His cabinet is stacked with anti-LGBT people and he supports the FADA bill as well as his list of supreme court nominees being anti-same sex marriage. Just because he himself hasn't been outspokenly anti-LGBT doesn't mean he is pro-LGBT rights.  Edit:  https://np.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/5r8a2w/white_house_says_obamas_order_on_lgbtq_rights/dd5fi9a/  Here is a list of the things that make him anti-LGBT. I read a buch of mainstrem American media. I don't usually find those words you mentioned or whatever equivalent. Maybe socialist and communist are a little more common but not so much.  Xenophobic, islamaphobic, racist, sexist, fascist, etc. are fucking everywhere in a good chunk of your big news outlets. It's the same in Europe really. We have some actual commies though which I love. I certainly believe that left is very quick to name call and use blown out of proportion rhetoric.   Xenophobic, Islamaphobic, Racist, Sexist, Fascist, Nazi, etc. The problem is, the cries of Homophobia, Sexism, and Xenophobia, are overblown, and aren't the real problem.  They are just a symptom.  The problem is the collusion of power between the Military, Government, and Private sector, which are supposed to be CHECKS to each other, but instead, have decided to collude.  The problem is, you guys aren't just saying Trump is racist, homophobic, sexist.  You're saying that POPULAR ideas that he has are Racist, as well as the People(about 50% of country) who voted for him. So ANY movement against trump, or the government in general, will have 50% of people opposing you(which means, nothing will get done... like always).  If you want change, you can't insult 50% of the population, unless your plan is to start a 50-50 civil war.  Maybe 1/2 the nation isn't made of raving racists.  Maybe you're not seeing the whole picture.  Building a wall, for ECONOMIC reasons, to keep another country's people out(whether it is Mexicans, Canadians, or Floridians) is not racist. Wanting an economic wall to keep illegal immigrants out, is not inherently racist(hell... they could even be the same race).  Profiling people in the USA(or those trying to get in), based on their appearance(whether it is skin color, Country of Origin, T-shirt variety, or wearing a ""hoodie"", or wearing a ""skimask""), when it comes to national security is not racist.  It's been done for all of history, and is not inherently racist.  Obama did not Let Syrians in... he was just quiet about it... unlike Trump.  Liberals have all gotten upset at the SMALL issues.  That was Trump's plan.  To divide the country, on its social issues(which he could care less about... he's a businessmen... not a reverend).  The Liberals are all out there Calling Conservatives Racists.  The Conservatives are calling the Liberals Baby Killers.  As long as we allow ourselves to be divided and distracted by social issues(that the rich care little about), BOTH PARTIES can continue the same policies that have been pushed for decades.  1.) Increased Mass Surveillance/Curtailment of Civil Liberties.  2.)  Wars in Middle East.  3.) Support Israel.  4.) War on Drugs.  5.) War on Whistleblowers.  6.) Increase National Debt.   7.) Decrease Firearms Availability  You'll never find a major politician(whether it is Trump, Obama, Sanders, or Hilary) that goes against these points, once in office. The public's trust in the media was at an all time low prior to Trump's presidency.    Trump is going about it the wrong way, far too Bullheaded but the media does deserve some criticism. Though not how he is doing it.  The public in general thinks the media are snakes. I know I do.  Look at the entire ""Muslim ban"". It's not a Muslim ban but the media is letting that narrative flow because they're shitbirds.  I'm perfectly okay with him treating journalists like shit, because journalists are the only people who are as slimy, dishonest, and useless as politicians. Yeah and its not just liberal media like Huffington Post and MSMBC. It's almost impossible to find a general news site, besides Fox, that isn't reporting the facts and being attacked for it.   It's not the media's job to placate the government. If anything it is the opposite.  You mean the media that constantly attacked and lied about him, I wounder why... He narrowly lost the deputy leadership contest (against Dennis Healey). Not sure he was ever close to becoming the leader. I know it's kind of sad, has he ever tried to run for PM? The best leaders are always the ones who don't want to be leaders! That's because Jeremy Corbyn has a terrible image in the media. He looks like a total scruff so noboby takes him seriously, but I don't think he's that good of a leader tbh Why would redditors, generally American, care as much about a foreign leader as they do about the guy they've had 24/7 news coverage on for over a year? If you think Reddit is an accurate barometer for public sentiment then you need to get out of your bedroom No dynasties. Nah, incumbent usually wins an election, but after 8 years the parties usually swap. Of course if people were aware of that trend they wouldn't be so surprised Trump won I'd say it leans towards the r/politics crowd but not nearly as much as other subreddits. [removed] I don't think thats what they were saying. I am not a Trump supporter, nor did I vote for him, however, whenever I discuss politics with people lately I get forced into the position of defending him because some of the stuff people are saying is just ridiculous and unfounded. I don't like Trump, and think there are plenty of valid criticisms that can be made about him, but its hard to have a factual discussion about his administration when people are calling him Hitler or criticizing him for things they think he'll do in the future as if they've already happened. Why would his supporters criticize him when he is doing exactly what he said he would do?  We will see how it turns out, but for now this is what half of the country wanted.  I think it is rather scary though because populism can be just as destructive as fascism. >He will never be criticized by his supporters until their jobs/finances are negatively affected.  The consequences of the coming trade war with China are understood and accepted as necessary.  So don't hold your breath.  Trump really doesn't have the traits of a fascist. You either need to stop reading buzzfeed or look up the definition of a fascist.  He did, but he won the electoral college vote, the only one that matters because we are not a democracy, we are a republic. Oh god what have you done you have opened the donald trump supporters floodgates   Ehhh i think he still does a lot of what he wants. The wall certainly wasnt a republican idea. It was a donald idea. Infrastructure spending isnt a republicsn idea, it's a donald idea and a leftist idea. But yea, he cedes control to others where appropriate, but thats still what any other republican would do, so hes still less than desirable to repubs for that reason and due to his inability to control his social media, and other ideas he endorses. It's almost like he's controlled by the people who voted for him! How terrible! Seriously took a 40 second  google search to see he's not a doctor and that he himself doesn't present himself as one, and is rather simply an enthusiast. Also told me it wasn't a few years ago that he wrote this but more like a decade and a half. Thanks for that info! Really? The suppression of labor power?   Don't conflate Stalinism with pure Marxist communism. For what it's worth I think both are obsolete, but let's be clear and consistent in our analysis here.  I am not either, in fact I support EU....but what he said is true Please explain how Clinton is relevant in any way. You can't defend Trump for 4 years by just saying ""but Hillary"".  Also, forgetting to turn your lights of is a mistake. Forgetting someones birthday is a mistake. Deliberately starving millions of people in order to maintain control over their country, whilst forbidding the import of food to the region and increasing exports is not a ""mistake"". It's a crime against humanity, and mass murder. It seems to me that what you've described is very effective authoritarianism, which I agree is part of fascism but I think you've left out other important characteristics like the nationalist narrative. Nevertheless you're right, the US government is not a fascist government NOW by any means. But Trump has in my opinion really shown that he wants to be an authoritarian leader of the type you've described. For example he has: praised authoritarian leaders like Putin, attacked the media and elevated fringe media that puts out what he wants, threatened businesses with bullying tactics, complained about artists of many sorts who even mildly criticize him, expressed a desire to tighten libel laws because of such criticism, and most worryingly started to consolidate power in the government by silencing dissent (gag orders to the EPA and parks departments, firing acting AG and acting head of ICE) and by threatening checks and balances on his power (replacing intelligence director and head of joint chiefs of staff on the NSC with Bannon and Priebus, ordered federal customs agents to ignore a judge's stay on his executive order).   So he's not yet an authoritarian ruler but I think we should all be worried that he might try to become one.  Obamas stay didn't affect current Visa holders, nor did it affect green card holders, nor were there deportations without a hearing, nor was the right to an attorney denied.   There's a huge gulf of difference between staying future visas, and going after current Visa holders and green cards.   > a lack of creativity and critical thought.  Which sums up a majority of people Coincidentally while everyone was calling Trump Hitler he was doing 3-6 events a day the last month in the rust belt with a message of ""you will never be forgotten again"" while Hillary only had 6 events the last month, and mostly CA and NY fundraisers. She didn't even step foot in the state of Wisconsin.   It's just easier for people to generalize 60M+ as white supremacists, racists, etc.   Surely some are, but the idea that a majority or even a large portion are hateful in their priorities just feels so tone deaf and out of touch  The majority of the people who use the name ""Hitler"" or ""Nazi"" to label people they don't like come from the left. The majority of the people who hate Israel and Zionism come from the left. I don't think it's too far a stretch to assume the people throwing around bad guys from the 1940's do so because they want to make light of the holocaust.  I'm glad Glenn beck got the medical help he needed and is now a sane person >""both parties are the same"" dialog.  I hate that argument. Yeah both parties are the same, except when it comes to any issues.      In terms of how politics runs (or ran, in this new era) yeah both parties were the same in that regard, but what they did with their political capital is completely different.  I've got this to say about Hitler: he was a good speaker, and he turned Post-WWI Germany's economy into something that would be a threat for WWII.   Trump wants to build a multi-billion dollar wall.  Actually he wasnt that great besides the public speaking. Its a myth that he was a great leader, he was actually pretty bad; constantly double stacking spheres of influence and authority among his subordinates (thought to establish a competitive spirit but most often only ensured petty power struggles that was catastrophic for the war effort) prone to extreme bingeworking when he felt like it and being nigh inaccessible other times, he *constantly* made bad priorities that were made worse by him and his upper-echeleon cronies clockwork dependency  to calculate exclusively with best-outcome predictions and never having a good plan B, intervening (sometimes all the way down on platoon level) in the most asinine way on the military fronts and in the end just losing interest in the whole shitcake that he himself started, wanting to take the future of Western Europe with him down the drain Sane people ignored that rhetoric too. > You will not find a US president in recent history that was not called Hitler.  Trying to spread the blame around by cherry-picking a few exceptions is not going to work this time. I'm not sure if Carter is ""recent"", but he's still alive, and I doubt he got called Hitler all that frequently. And even though Hillary Clinton had a lot of insults lobbed her way, I don't recall the ""Hillary=Hitler"" meme gaining much traction. Same goes for Gore and Kerry and Mondale. Identity politics is the only way to keep otherwise rational Democrats from joining the Socialists.  When people stop paying attention to the fabled Identity War, they begin to notice the Class War. Dems dont want it either, else they'd have done it the last x times they held office. So you're saying that currently, there's no one on the right side of the political spectrum who is using radical hyperbole?  You can't think of anyone doing this?  If not, you may not be getting the full story on what's happening in the world. ""The democrats keep calling out my ultranationalist demagogue president as fascist, and it's hurting my feelings.""  Deal with it. You act as though the Republicans didn't spend months of time just trying to repeal Obamacare over and over again. You act as though Republicans didn't *deny a sitting president their supreme court nominee* they didn't even allow a hearing for a man the GOP had praised before!  Democrats are no better than Republicans, I don't think I am superior to Republicans, so I will use their tactics. They seem to work. There's a growing ""either you're completely with us, or you're completely against us"" mentality growing on both sides and that is what scares me more than anything Trump can do. Hardline liberals and conservatives are time and time again asking moderates to ""pick a side"" I'm sure that depends a lot on where you live. Where I am, if you believe what science says, if you care about human rights, or you aren't a Christian then you are a stupid crybaby liberal. Or labeled as a communist.   It goes both ways. There were people where I live that marched just about every day for 8 years with signs that said ""Impeach Obama"" handed out leaflets that explained how he is a Muslim and the devil at the same time, while holding posters depicting him Hitler.   Both sides engage in this behavior and it's gross from both sides.  Turns out if you mock, insult and call 60 million people racists then they'll vote for the guy who says that he can help them instead.  It's crazy, I know.  To be honest, in my opinion the biggest mistake that the Dems made in the election is that their message was mixed and wrong.  Whether true or not, much of the campaign felt like it was about how people should vote for her experience (i.e. more of the same) or vote for her genitals which turned off many women who felt patronised.  Trump's campaign was all around better.  He was vague when he needed to be vague and concrete when he needed to be concrete.  He told people that things were bad now but he would make them better.  It was clear and simple messaging that resonated because people really are suffering economically.  The left is collapsing in the UK and US under this neo-liberal nonsense.  The electorate doesn't like it, many of them vehemently disagree with it, and they feel it's overshadowing bigger issues in their lives.  We in Labour have the same problem in the UK - in electing Corbyn we kicked out an ""enemy"" in Blairist globalists but then let in a whole other mob of the identity politicking far left.  The classic liberal of straight forward equality, tolerance and protectionism has been bastardised into resembling an ugly beast of itself.  We now have a large amount of left wingers who call the working classes ""dumb idiots"" for voting for Trump or Brexit who are ""too stupid to know what's right"".  That's Tory as fuck but nobody seems to have noticed.  Then we've got the recently new position of how it's ok to be violent towards people speaking in the street you politically offend you.  That's far-right as fuck.   These are just isolated incidents on social media of course, but the general trend that the left wing is confused and has lost its way seems to hold true in my experience.  This is most easily seen by going to political party meetings.  If you go to one in a working class area in the North of England then the people there and the issues they are concerned about are just on a different planet to those in London, for example.  I imagine the same holds true in the US too.  Time will tell, I agree he's not done enough to be considered a fascist right now, but his actions in just 10 days have been deeply concerning to a lot of people and certainly have the *potential* to be the start of a fascist movement. Well it does have socialist elements, which is essentially the road to Communism. Which IMO is the right way to run national health care Eloquently out and I couldn't agree more. Globalism clearly isn't a good thing but it seems prominent figures believe it is! Yep, the open borders postmodern neo-left is pretty much a bunch of whiny useful idiots. People like Google's better because it confirms their bias. There are some leftist governments that could be compared to fascism > that exalts nation and often race above the individual   This is exactly why he isn't fascist. He and his conservative allies believe in strong, individual rights from the state (e.g. arms, religion, etc) and are generally anti-Big government, with the notable exception on basic functions like defense.  Fascist government promotes the nationalization of all programs and resources, and the full mobilization of citizenry towards achieving national goals. This is entirely incongruent with his policies, like freezing of federal hires, repealing the insurance mandate, and emphasis on deregulation.  He's not trying to build a bigger federal government, he's trying to make it smaller.   To be fair Trump has advocated for plenty of components to this. He's removed people from positions of power who have disagreed with him, he's talked about increasing military spending and he's already marginalized Hispanics and Muslims. Not to mention his hatred of the press who he calls dishonest and on the campaign trail has talked about ""opening up the libel laws"" (which he is incapable of doing) to make it easier for him to sue them and win, effectively silencing negative criticism.  Sure plenty of this stuff is just talk, but it really shows you where his mindset is. He's very much a ""fall in line or be punished"" type of guy, which, while not exactly fascist shares some of the same characteristics in the way he conducts himself and his administration. I for one, find it somewhat troubling. lol, looks like the site was created for Dubbya.  > ALL of these traits have been exhibited by Trump.  So I'm going to challenge that a bit, not because I don't think it's possible, but because I haven't seen it myself.  > 1.)  Powerful and Continuing Nationalism:  yep, no challenge here.  > 2.)  Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights:  being ok with waterboarding, maybe? what do you see?  > 3.)  Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause:  muslims? I'm not convinced that is a scapegoat being used to ""Unify""  > 4.)  Supremacy of the Military:  His whole thing is focusing on domestic issues, if he neglects those while giving more funding to military, then that would qualify, but right now I don't see this one.  > 5.)  Rampant Sexism:  no challenge here.  > 6.)  Controlled Mass Media:  Definitely not. Though he may want it, the media is definitely not shills for what he wants. He's getting hammered left and right.  > 7.)  Obsession with National Security:  Yep, this is happening.  > 8.)  Religion and Government are Intertwined:  This could be a more general Republican thing, but I haven't seen Trump really exhibit this. The SCOTUS pick may shed more light.  > 9.)  Corporate Power is Protected:  yes.  > 10.)  Labor Power is Suppressed:  Maybe with his businesses? He recently met with Union leaders and seems to be about to give them huge infrastructure contracts. Seems like the opposite of suppressing labor power.  > 11.)  Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts:  Not seeing this.  > 12.)  Obsession with Crime and Punishment:  Possibly. He has a whole ""Standing Up For Our Law Enforcement Community"" section on the website. That in itself isn't fascist, only when we ignore civil liberties in the name of patriotism does it become fascist.  > 13.)  Rampant Cronyism and Corruption:  This one concerns me a lot.  > 14.)  Fraudulent Elections:  No. He was fairly elected. You may say it was a smear campaign, but so has every election since I've been alive.  I would content that he has not disrespected human rights at any time, the second on the list. Can you link the interview of Dr Lawrence W.Britt? It 404'ed in that link.  Also, a little bit more background on this fellow will be good, there is no Wikipedia links, no Famous person profile in Google. The only book I found on Amazon attributed to him is a Fiction novel published in 1998. The only other entries from basic goggle-fu comes up with Right-wing counter-arguments.   So, someone with better google-fu help me out here. Who is he? Run Sharia through the same points. Islamism is a right wing political ideology.  Not there ""yet""?  It isn't even headed to that direction.    The 14 points from your link describe Islam to a tee.  Weird. Most of those points have been exhibited by every Republican since Eisenhower. I like Webster for non politicized definitions. I'd be surprised of oxford wasn't crazy after looking at what happens on the campus. Turns out extremes are bad. I think OP means that the democratic party in the states is more comparable with the conservatives here than the left wing parties I think it's not that the people in the States are terribly conservative, it's just that their current situation is *super* economically liberal compared to Europe so when they try to go left they end up asking for some things that would be centrist in Europe. Since those things are the most likely to succeed (and things like the appalling American healthcare system get a lot of attention) it does look as if the American left was really just like the European center.  I'll go over your list, commenting on them how they look to a German:  - Universal basic income: **Very leftist** but gets mentioned by a lot of people. - Single-payer healthcare: **Centrist.** Seen as generic healthcare reform. Everyone but the liberal party would agree that it's a good thing. - High taxes on the wealthy: **Moderately leftist.** Hard liberals might disagree but everyone else agrees that some form of progressive taxation is the most workable system. - Making education available to all: **Centrist.** A few years ago Germany did a rather rightist thing: They made public universities charge tuition. (We're talking 500 /semester.) A few federal countries have since gone back on that because they didn't like it. Asking for affordable college degrees is *very* slightly left by our standards but I think even our right parties would agree that American education costs way too much for what it does. Given your current situation I'll go with centrist here. - Forward-thinking approaches to climate change: **Green.** Not a left/right issue but a traditional Green Party stance. The Greens are one of our traditional minor-but-important parties and don't cleanly adhere to the left/right scale although they do tend to be more left than right. - End of oil subsidies: **Green/Liberal.** The greens hate fossil fuels. The liberals hate subsidies. The left is moderately against fossil fuel subsidies but that might be due to spending a lot of time with the Greens. - Funding of basic research: **I'm unsure.** I just tried looking it up and all of the major parties I looked at paid lip service to basic research. As in ""they verbally fellated the concept"". Still, I don't have good data on how they do in practice and I didn't find the position of the liberals which is probably the same groveling combined with ""as long as it doesn't cost any money"".  In general you seem like the kind of person who'd probably vote Green over here not because you agree with their core policies all that much but because they're socially progressive and fairly social-minded without being populists like the left-of-center-we-swear Social Democrats or completely detached from reality like some of the real leftist parties. Sanders IS left wing. Most dems, and the party's core values are very conservative to us in the UK. And despite all of that, America hasn't shown much sign of any more 'left' policies. >  I support UBI and socialism in general. Single-payer healthcare, high taxes on the wealthy, general redistribution of funds to make education at all levels available to anyone qualified, forward-thinking approaches to climate change, end of oil subsidies, funding of basic research, etc.  None of that has anything to do with socialism.     You see, your whole country is so far to the right that you call centrist policies outright socialism. Your country has   lost all sense of perspective and you don't even know what words mean anymore.  > Single-payer healthcare, high taxes on the wealthy, general redistribution of funds to make education at all levels available to anyone qualified, forward-thinking approaches to climate change, end of oil subsidies, funding of basic research, etc.   None of which have anything to do with socialism. The United States was first settled by a people so conservative and right leaning that the British Empire didn't want them practicing their their backwards religion (see: our Quakers/Amish).  The entire American perspective is grounded in those far-right origins. Most of the left-wing Americans are still on the far right side of the political spectrum when compared to the rest of the world. >I support UBI and socialism in general.   You support the workers having the means of production? I usually distill it as, ""A patriot thinks their country is awesome. A nationalist thinks their country is way better than yours, always, and also fuck you."" Japanese internment camps were an executive order issued by an ultra right fascist??? > Because the argument of ""protecting"" one's country has been used to horrifying actions in the past  So has ending income inequality, but I don't hear people calling Bernie Sanders Pol Pot. >Because the argument of ""protecting"" one's country has been used to horrifying actions in the past, such as Japanese internment camps.  And 100 million people were killed in a single century in the name of uplifting the poor and giving more power to the worker. Why is it still trendy to espouse those ideas? Green card holders are not citizens. > While they were in fact voted in  They weren't even *really* voted in. Hitler lost to Hindenburg in 1932, and his party only had a plurality with about a third of the vote. Hindenburg ended up appointing Hitler chancellor after they had trouble forming a coalition. Then, the Nazis used force to do everything else, including getting the Reichstag to pass an enabling act that gave the Nazi leaders dictatorial powers. The point is: the process was only *sort of* in accordance with German laws.  They got the single largest percent of the vote of any party, but it was still only like 30% or so. They couldn't get over 50%, and IIRC no other party would ally with them to form a government.  And then Hindenburg appointed Hitler and his cronies to the country's leadership.  Trump is kinda similar because he failed to get a majority of the vote, failed to even get a plurality of the vote (he didn't even get the single largest percentage of any candidate - that was Hillary), and then was appointed by the EC who themselves are appointed by private political parties. Especially when you're colonized by the British ""The facts have a well-known liberal bias"" [](/GNU Terry Pratchett) Wait, how are those (bringing jobs and stimulating local goods) a bad thing again? well he was elected president and campaigned on it so I'd say a lot of people support it  Because over-regulation is burdening our economy to collapse. Thus, you tie greater deregulation to regulation in order to guarantee a decreasing pace. I'm well aware of Bannon.  >Bar one or two guys, his whole cabinet looks like a Goldman Sachs venue.  And who's the ex-KKK leader on his cabinet? Let me guess. Sessions is the forner KKK leader in your world?  Elon Musk is in there too Which cabinet member is the former KKK leader and most importantly *what are his current views*?  For instance Hillary is good friends with Robert Byrd who spent time in the KKK decades ago, but he has since changed his racist, bigoted views and regrets being in the KKK. So it's really a non-story (despite moron Trump supporters trying to make it one). Most of those words describe single traits, not a complex government ideology like communism or socialism, so it makes sense that words like sexist and islamaphobic are used more prevalently.   ""We should ban all people from Muslim majority countries from entering America, even if they have a green card."" -Islamaphobic/xenophobic  ""There is something wrong with a financial system with this large of a wage disparity."" -communist? Socialist?  The words you list for Republicans aren't just mean words, they're accurate descriptions of actions the right has taken. That's why they're used as often as they are. Because they're facts (not counting fascism which falls under the communist/socialist rule). Maybe those words are used because they actually apply in the situation?  Riiiight.  I have yet to see a conversation where someone tries to disagree with any single popular republican view and they aren't instantly called a liberal/socialist.  You tow the line or you are automatically far left. Jesus finally. Someone who wants to talk about our issues instead of insult and belittle They absolutely do need criticism. I do not read or watch CNN anymore, because all they publish is sensationalist garbage now. NPR and BBC are the only news sources that I can tolerate.    He called it a ban first... Over the last 8 years of their drooling over Obama, it's probably been forgotten by many that their actual role is to hold gov accountable for anything. I would argue that Fox is just as right leaning as Huffington Post is left leaning (let's just say they both do a whole lot leaning).  I read both of them, but I expect them both to be biased.  Lots of times you'll get half the story from each.  EDIT: Also, BBC, NPR, New York Times, and The Washington Post are all fairly unbiased. ""He unsuccessfully challenged Neil Kinnock for the Labour leadership in 1988."" Do you mean he didn't come close in that one, only in the deputy one previously? Oh I see yeah, he only got 11% of the vote. My bad. Oh no he's a firm backbencher, Corbyn was the same til he was pushed into leadership Yeah. I wouldn't vote for him but I can see the media's given him an unfairly rough ride. The street protests were hardly fucking expansive. Oh yes, I remember the street protests too when the Chinese last visited.  It was like 30 Falun Gong folks holding signs. ""Plenty"", lol People honestly think that half the country is Democrat and half the country is Republican and it's a tight squeeze every election, they forget that the bulk of voters don't really have any deep ties either way and after 8 years of one they tend to vote another because they're sick of them.  Obama's campaign was literally all about Change, so when Trump did one about change people also lapped it up. [removed] You just wrote a paragraph saying nothing. So tell me, what would cause a Trump supporter to not object to clear issues they have with the man? Is it really because their feelings are so hurt that they become defensive beyond belief? Because that is insane, and if they really feel that way then it is better if they don't vote. Cause it turns out elections have conswquences >#[**The 14 points of Fascism**](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/11/20/1452457/-Time-to-pull-out-again-The-14-Points-of-Fascism)  >**Powerful and Continuing Nationalism**  >Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.  >**Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights**  >Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of ""need."" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.  >**Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause**  >The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial, ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.  >**Supremacy of the Military**  >Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.  >**Rampant Sexism**  >The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy.  >**Controlled Mass Media**  >Sometimes the media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.  >**Obsession with National Security**  >Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.  >**Religion and Government are Intertwined**  >Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.  >**Corporate Power is Protected**  >The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.  >**Labor Power is Suppressed**  >Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.  >**Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts**  >Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.  >**Obsession with Crime and Punishment**  >Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.  >**Rampant Cronyism and Corruption**  >Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.  >**Fraudulent Elections**  >Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.  >**EDIT:** if that list by Laurence Britt during the Bush 43 administration doesn't worry you, [check out Umberto Eco's list that he penned in 1995...](http://www.openculture.com/2016/11/umberto-eco-makes-a-list-of-the-14-common-features-of-fascism.html)  >***The cult of tradition.***  >^One ^has ^only ^to ^look ^at ^the ^syllabus ^of ^every ^fascist ^movement ^to ^find ^the ^major ^traditionalist ^thinkers. ^The ^Nazi ^gnosis ^was ^nourished ^by ^traditionalist, ^syncretistic, ^occult ^elements.  >***The rejection of modernism.***  >^The ^Enlightenment, ^the ^Age ^of ^Reason, ^is ^seen ^as ^the ^beginning ^of ^modern ^depravity. ^In ^this ^sense ^Ur-Fascism ^can ^be ^defined ^as ^irrationalism.  >***The cult of action for actions sake.***  >^Action ^being ^beautiful ^in ^itself, ^it ^must ^be ^taken ^before, ^or ^without, ^any ^previous ^reflection. ^Thinking ^is ^a ^form ^of ^emasculation.  >***Disagreement is treason.***  >^The ^critical ^spirit ^makes ^distinctions, ^and ^to ^distinguish ^is ^a ^sign ^of ^modernism. ^In ^modern ^culture ^the ^scientific ^community ^praises ^disagreement ^as ^a ^way ^to ^improve ^knowledge.  >***Fear of difference.***  >^The ^first ^appeal ^of ^a ^fascist ^or ^prematurely ^fascist ^movement ^is ^an ^appeal ^against ^the ^intruders. ^Thus ^Ur-Fascism ^is ^racist ^by ^definition.  >***Appeal to social frustration.***  >^One ^of ^the ^most ^typical ^features ^of ^the ^historical ^fascism ^was ^the ^appeal ^to ^a ^frustrated ^middle ^class, ^a ^class ^suffering ^from ^an ^economic ^crisis ^or ^feelings ^of ^political ^humiliation, ^and ^frightened ^by ^the ^pressure ^of ^lower ^social ^groups.  >***The obsession with a plot.***  >^The ^followers ^must ^feel ^besieged. ^The ^easiest ^way ^to ^solve ^the ^plot ^is ^the ^appeal ^to ^xenophobia.  >***The enemy is both strong and weak.***  >^By ^a ^continuous ^shifting ^of ^rhetorical ^focus, ^the ^enemies ^are ^at ^the ^same ^time ^too ^strong ^and ^too ^weak.  >***Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy.***  >^For ^Ur-Fascism ^there ^is ^no ^struggle ^for ^life ^but, ^rather, ^life ^is ^lived ^for ^struggle.  >***Contempt for the weak.***  >^Elitism ^is ^a ^typical ^aspect ^of ^any ^reactionary ^ideology.  >***Everybody is educated to become a hero.***  >^In ^Ur-Fascist ^ideology, ^heroism ^is ^the ^norm. ^This ^cult ^of ^heroism ^is ^strictly ^linked ^with ^the ^cult ^of ^death.  >***Machismo and weaponry.***  >^Machismo ^implies ^both ^disdain ^for ^women ^and ^intolerance ^and ^condemnation ^of ^nonstandard ^sexual ^habits, ^from ^chastity ^to ^homosexuality.  >***Selective populism.***  >^There ^is ^in ^our ^future ^a ^TV ^or ^Internet ^populism, ^in ^which ^the ^emotional ^response ^of ^a ^selected ^group ^of ^citizens ^can ^be ^presented ^and ^accepted ^as ^the ^Voice ^of ^the ^People.  >***Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak.***  >^All ^the ^Nazi ^or ^Fascist ^schoolbooks ^made ^use ^of ^an ^impoverished ^vocabulary, ^and ^an ^elementary ^syntax, ^in ^order ^to ^limit ^the ^instruments ^for ^complex ^and ^critical ^reasoning.    > Infrastructure spending isnt a republicsn idea, it's a donald idea and a leftist idea.

I mean, clean water, working roads and bridges, high speed internet, advanced power grid... how are things not no-brainers to EVERYONE? I sincerely do not understand someone could be against these things >Really? The suppression of labor power?  It was the Solidarity labor union that brought down Communism in Poland. I said many of the signs... not all of the signs, but thanks for cherry picking... In what way is the EU an empire? I don't think the argument is that the government is currently fascist. It's that he is. And especially bannon. Also, I think the nationalist narrative is already here, we're just used to it by now. Think of all the times the right calls themselves patriots, or the tea party, or when the loyal opposition was called unamerican during the Iraq war. Now, I'm not saying trump is a fascist on purpose. I think he's just pro trump. But I also think his authoritarianism and cult of personality and willingness to give to business every time put him as close to fascism as you can get without being a true believer. Upvoted you btw for the well thought out post. All of these things were true with the 2013 ban besides it not taking place immediately. The media just didnt get hysterical. [removed] Here's the thing. I'm Jewish, and as someone who had relatives killed in the Holocaust, I abhor what Israel has been doing with the settlements. Honestly, if it resembles anything, it would be Lebensraum. The reason why I hate what Israel is doing so much is because it started as a Jewish city on a hill, and then quickly devolved into doing to the surrounding people what we purport to hate when it happens to us. Getting kicked out of our land, being abused by governments, having lives stolen from us... You'd think, of all the people on Earth who could empathize with the victims there, it would be us. But no, they had to go and do to the Palestinians what the Romans did to us.  That's why I've grown to dislike Israel. Not simply because they're Jews, but because they aren't good ones. >but what they did with their political capital is completely different  * Bomb people * Restrict liberties in the name of security * Increase debt  I dunno, seems the same to me. Both parties are corrupt. Both parties are equally bad.  They both did a lot of the same policies: increased the power of government, increased public spending and debt, created regulations and official treaties to benefit big corporations.  By being both so equally bad, they paved the way for any charismatic outsider to get elected POTUS. Trump just happened to be there, it could have been anyone.   Yeah Hitler was more of an odd duck than a great leader. Most of his ""success"" was due to sharp people underneath him. But he was kind of a weirdo who wound up as the crazed figurehead of a movement.  No, no, no. Marxism is *intersectional*. Communism is not established before the identity war has been won. To this end, we must lead people away from liberal feminism and towards true egalitarianism; no class, no misoginy, no misandry, no racism, no ableism!  They're all connected to each other. We cannot remove racism without also removing class. We can't remove class without also removing gender inequalities and racism. i wish i had gold for you good sir The thing people dont seem to comprehend. Both sides have had many times thoughout history to play out their ""evil agenda"" but all that really happens is a hollow pitiful attempt to please their voting base. Both sides benefit from the status quo, its what get them elected! He's specifically talking about the democrat's use of the term fascist and their comparisons to Hitler. He's not denying that it's a two way road.   A comparison would be the the conservative use of hyperbole with the term communism and comparisons to Stalin.   Don't be so offended, the guy has a point and he's specifically talking about the use of the term fascist on the left... No one on the right is calling anyone Hitler. Thats what I said. ? Name calling has nothing to do with any of the examples you brought up.   The dems aren't doing any of the things that Republicans did to block Obama. They are just taking every action of Trump screaming ""REEEEEEEEE"" while waving a sign.  Ummm, first you would need to start winning some elections.  You missed a step. Nice job with this example taking a quote I didn't say.  I'm not a Republican, and I'm not a Democrat.  What does trying to repeal Obamacare or deny the sitting president a supreme court request during the last few months of his presidency (there is precedent for this) have to do with calling someone racist, sexist, xenophobic? Yup and its going to come to a head. But Trump has the advantage because his motto is America first. Youll be hard pressed to go against that line of thinking.  The issue with ""the left"" ie modern liberals in the US and UK, but also in a lot of places, is they don't understand how people work or what the working class even is. The working class, i.e. the common worker, has, historically, been pro-nationalist, pro-identity, pro-job opportunity. They are strongly tied to their fellow laborers (ie countrymen), like some liberal ideas, but are also very much in favor of sustaining the culture they associate with. Been the same way for 100 years, probably longer  look at early labor movements. Sure, many had collectivist bents, but they look ""right wing"" by modern standards.  That underlying basis hasn't changed because, for most people, what it means to be human and what our daily struggles are haven't changed radically. We as a species are still fighting the same fight, struggling to make ends meet, just on new terrain, with new words, and the ""progressive left"" is pointlessly collectivizing into superlatives (usually blame-groups) and polarizing everyone who doesn't agree with every aspect of their utterly incoherent narrative. It's insane to watch.  I'm about as far left as you can go and I, paradoxically, appear to have more in common with the moderate right winger than the average liberal. Their identity politics and unrealistic campaigns drive me mad because, even though I kinda like the underlying ideas, I still have a slight nationalist bent and am invested in my culture, heritage, and future, as well of those of the people I know. And I can't get behind something I don't believe will work. As someone with free will, as a human being, I think it's my right to care about those things when I want to, and not just when some political narritive finds it convenient I do. Except now, by default, I'll be thrown on the ""other side"". Even if I only disagree on select points because I think they're bad ideas and / or unrealistic. Result: against all odds and sane rational, the modern ""left"" has managed to damn me as a radical leftist and radical right winger in the same breath. The doublethink is so very strong.  The fact that people don't seem to understand why this is a serious issue is mind boggling.  Human beings have individual interests and collective interests, but the latter aren't created in a vacuum. They're created by massing together individual concerns, not by forcing a narrative down someone's throat. That's never worked and, frankly, narratives work by appealing, not by making people fit into boxes. Just like trying to respect every individual interest won't ever work because interests always conflict. It's been shown time and again: those who manage to relate to the largest number of real, pressing issues that people face come out ahead. Whether they genuinely care or are just using it as a narrative is largely irrelevant.  What I can't understand is how the ""left"" keeps bludgeoning ahead, never realizing that the message isn't resonating (because, frankly, it's a terrible message). Almost as if shouting it louder and farther will, somehow, convince people who aren't already sold on it. Except that has pretty much never worked in anything but the most brutal, repressive regiemes. Because one's personal survival kinda gets put before anything else, even if it means doing something you don't necessarily want to  like agreeing with the right on rather pressing political and social issues because no one else will talk about them.  /end rant  Had to get this out. This last week's been driving me up the wall. Yeah the left needs to check their moral superiority complex at the door. The views of others cant be just thrown away and dismissed as wrong and racist etc etc etc. It will result in the conservative populist wave that is seen in America and Europe.  There was a really excellent post not long ago about what you're talking about: https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/5jdivw/the_dnc_right_now/dbfm9l3/. The left has become an ugly, smug, regressive group that doesn't resemble the principles it once championed.  Socialist elements? Like what exactly? I agree socialist healthcare (government run, instead of insurance run) health care is the way to go, but that's not what the majority of the ACA is. Remember the individual mandate came from the Republican congress of 1995 as an alternative to the expanding of Medicare first proposed under the Clinton administration. That's a good indicator that it's pretty opposite of socialist goals in healthcare. Globalism is great!  (If your looking for cheap labor) Identity politics can get tiresome.  Its far easier to communicate about, thats why politicians latch on it for political points.   People need to start understanding the economic ideals behind it and the main message of more democracy for the worker (i dont believe in communism).... my beliefs tie somewhere between what i call ""proper"" socialism and anarchism. For me, the end goal should be democracy devolved down to the workers in organisations.   Thats a long way off though and i like what Noam Chomsky said about supporting nationalisation and welfare and such for the time being as it helps better peoples lives as opposed to allowing this shit show of exploitation continue. The left needs to unite properly again if its gonna take on a renewed right wing force. >There are some leftist governments that could be compared to fascism  There have arguably been no major leftist governments in history. At most you might be able to argue Catalonia during the Spanish civil war, and perhaps the very early USSR under Lenin, but even that's debatable, and neither of those were very major comparatively. Left-wing movements, as a rule, oppose the social hierarchy that is a core part of fascist ideology and generally oppose the nationalism of fascism. Which ones? What about his ""America First"" inauguration speech or his repeated refrain of law and order? And why would he appoint someone who wants to bring God's kingdom to fruition through her position as education secretary if he believed in individual religious rights from the state? And what about the administration's repeated demonisation of citizen-run media sources that run contrary to it? Those all seem very authoritarian and nationalistic, not individual-centered. 6) I agree that the media isn't under his thumb, he is facing scrutiny from many outlets. But also remember that Steve Bannon of Breitbart is practically his right hand man.   11) He removed funding for the national endowment for the arts and public radio.  Denies climate change and scientific fact. Definitely disdain for intellectuals. The scapegoats and common enemy has long been a part of the American political narrative, typically an ""us vs. them."" In the case of Trump, the scapegoats tend to be: Muslims, those dirty liberals, Mexicans (or Mexico) taking your jooooooobs.  The control of mass media hasn't found its installation yet, but by Trump decrying everything that he doesn't like as ""fake news,"" it tells his followers to seek only True and Authentic sources of ""news"" such as Breibart.   As for military, yes to be fair, has been done over the past decade. We hold the military in a sacrosanct fashion. I can say that Trump wanted to have a full scale military parade for his inauguration, which couldn't be done for a lot of reasons. It's not glorification in totality, but it's getting there.  I don't see disdain for arts, but intellectuals, yes. At least to me, Trump's outright denial of climate change and installing an oil CEO as head of the EPA just reeks of contempt for those trying to steer us away from environmental catastrophe.  Fraudulent elections is a weird one. This a guy who was calling the elections rigged before he started winning. It's the last missing puzzle piece. However, I suppose gerrymandering and voter suppression played a small role, but yeah, not outright fraudulent elections. good post. i'm now even more terrified of his presidency after reading your post. thanks a lot. The problem is fascism is a political ideology or philosophy.  One or two sentences fail to fully define any ideology.  Sure, no argument there.  But he didn't say democrats. He said leftists. This is what I meant. But I'll chuck in that most ""leftists"" who voted Obama and Hillary are actually conservatives by proxy for supporting the same damn war machine that they whined at Bush for. Cons, cons and more cons. Feel sorry for Murica. Well yeah, because of the voting system. Certainly I'm aware of that, it's a frustration that pervades daily life.  My point is only that leftist Americans are, in my opinion, fairly left, even though we don't have representation (except Bernie and maybe Franken). You see, your whole country is so far to the left that you call centrist policies outright conservatism. Your country has lost all sense of perspective and you don't even know what words mean anymore.      This is fun. See my edit. In the US they do! (this is seriously a belief of people in the US, unfortunately. Even things like free college is decried as socialism). The Quakers were fine in the UK. The puritan settlers left the UK because they disagreed with the majority of people who refused to adopt a version of Christianity as fundamentalist as the puritans were. Why throw Quakers under the bus? In the world of theology they are considered liberal. Shit, I thought they were a policy of FDR, hero of the New Deal. But that wasn't real communism! /s Cuz the goal was just! /s Right because capitalism and neoliberal imperialism haven't caused near the same level of death and destruction, and totally wasn't the primary cause of totalitarian despots. Bananas included.  All reasonable ideas can be taken too far to the point of harm.  That goes just as much for the left as the right.  The problem with Trump is not that he's right-leaning in his ideals.  The problem is that he's taking them so far that they're hurting law-abiding citizens in an unreasonable way.   The reason this is different from it being ""trendy"" to espouse the ideas of socialism is because Trump is not just talking about radical ideas.   He's implementing them.   Stalin was not a leftist. He was a fascist who stole power in a leftist movement. The second he stopped being an internationalists and subscribed to the idea of Communist in one country, he stopped being an actual communist and drifted towards fascism.  At least im pretty sure that's who your getting at with that comment, not sure could be wrong. > Hindenburg   Wait, that's really the name? Talk about a disaster. <deadpan> Quick and easy example of media bias: ""Transgender girls are not boys"" - politifact while calling ted cruz a liar. This is not a fact, it is an opinion. You could easy debate what is and is not a boy, and neither side could ""prove"" anything, yet the media goes along with the left. Why do people support it though? What do they think it means in practice?  That seems ridiculously contrived. Like, why not just find the burdensome regulations and remove them? Why is that so hard? Why should the closing of some loophole require removal of a different regulation?  Really? Because last time I checked, the Dow was at a record high  and the last recession was largely attributed to a lack of financial regulation.    Musk is not a cabinet member Spent time in? He was a fuckin Exalted Cyclops of the KKK. It's not like he dabbled in it. IIRC NPR won't do live interviews with conservatives. Yeah, CNN is a garbage fire.  I stopped watching them after there was some mass shooting and they had a clip of a sheriff asking the media not to release the name of the shooter, because the shooter wanted the notority.  They cut away from that clip and said something like ""they don't want you to know the name, but we're going to report it anyways"", like they had some hot scoop.  BBC and NPR are definitely some of the best.  New York Times and the Washington Post are also generally pretty middle of the road.  You can also get some interesting insights by reading the same article on two different equivalently biased sites.  Like reading something on Fox News and Huffington Post. Yep. Most Britons don't care and know what it's really about. Offering the royal treatment to a US president who has publicly stated he is pro-Britain and wants to give us a trade deal ASAP when we're about to cut ties with our biggest trading partner was never going to be seen as anything other than business.  Exactly the same with the Chinese.  Sometimes you need to suck up your pride and admit that while Trump can be repugnant he is no Hitler and it is in the national interest to solidify ties with the US when we really need it. hahahaha awesome man! Solid comeback!! I thought I was pretty clear. Regardless of the topic, politics or otherwise, when one side uses hyperbole or speculation as an indictment of the other position, it forces reasonable people to first settle those issues before moving on. I can't have a reasonable conversation with someone about Trump when they're too busy comparing him to Hitler, I end up wasting my time trying to bring the person I'm talking ti back to reality.  Honestly, I can't answer your question about what it would take, because I'm not a Trump supporter, nor do I understand how either side can continually turn a blind eye to their guys, while ranting and raving about every little thing the other side does. I mean, obviously the right does it, and I don't feel I need to give you examplea since we probably agree on that point, but this whole immigration issue is a perfect example of the left doing exactly the same thing. Hundreds of thousands of people out protesting because Trump wont let certain people in the country, but where were those potests for the past 8 year while we've literally been bombing those same people? Its hard to take outrage from the left seriously when they turned a blind eye to so much shit while their guy was in office.   Also, so far I have seen no consequences worse than stuff we've let slide. I'll take an immigration ban over bulk data collection, or drone programs, or war on drugs anyday. I don't support the immigration ban, but all three of the issues I listed are far more important. When either side starts holding their people accountable, then they can start criticizing the other, but both Rs and Ds would rather point fingers while refusing to clean their own house. I agree, the parallels between Trump the man and historical fascist leaders are very striking. I don't think anybody is arguing the US is a fascist state (yet). And your username made me smile  Socialists breathe Democratists breathe  Dictators bresthe  Thus socialists Democratists and dictators are the exact same!  Exactly. They just have different demographics. Yeah that was my second paragraph. Thank you for summarising Because they're in power now, they have nobody *to* call Hitler.  Throughout Obama's presidency he was called Hitler, a secret Muslim, African, non-American, fascist, socialist... every possible moniker you could think of.  Neither party has the monopoly on hyperbole, don't trick yourself into thinking so. It's happened plenty.   If they're not calling anyone gay right now, it's only because they're completely in charge, but it happened plenty as recently as Obama's administration.  Here's a few articles that covered incidents like this:   http://theweek.com/articles/568774/why-republicans-are-obsessed-comparing-obama-hitler  http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/republicans_comparing_barack_obama_to_hitler_my_favorite_examples_of_the.html   https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2015/01/13/politics/randy-weber-obama-hitler/index.html.  http://www.salon.com/2015/01/13/7_conservatives_who_have_compared_obama_to_hitler/ I didn't read all your comment yet but you said ""I am far left that I have more in common with right wing""... look up the horseshoe theory.. it explains that the further left or right you go the closer you become to each other. Very interesting  What a great post, thanks for that Good read. Thanks.  I'm glad you got that out there, it's a good write up. Nice post dude.  I'd hardly call Democrats ""the left."" This isn't something that only applies to the left. Both sides are nothing more than echo chambers of hate and memes at this point. The left is done as long as it keeps the immigration narrative as it is today. Right or wrong a lot of people don't want to live next to iliterate people from Thrid World countries or suffer the effects they have on the economic situation of the less fortunated already there.   At this pace it will get relegated to becoming a tool of the establishment right wing parties to keep power when confronted to the surging right wing nationalists (the upcoming French election for example). Totalitarian is probably the word people are looking for. A fascist government is a totalitarian government and so is a communist one, they have a lot in common with a few major distinctions.  >6.) Controlled Mass Media: Definitely not. Though he may want it, the media is definitely not shills for what he wants. He's getting hammered left and right.  Also, I think wanting to control the media is definitely enough. Proposals like ""Opening up libel laws"" so that he can sue people who lie about him are extremely troubling, especially when he calls so many things that are objectively true, down to his inauguration attendance, lies.   I don't think anyone is saying that we currently live in a Fascist country, more that most of Trump's proposals fit in much better with Fascism than Democracy.  > But also remember that Steve Bannon of Breitbart is practically his right hand man.  Yes, this is absolutely terrifying.  I hate the Hitler comparison because it's been overdone to death, but he bought a newspaper and I think it really helped him rise.  Really optimistic that the internet will make that a less effective tactic. he prefers ""alternate"" intellectuals like himself   edit: added quotes to make it more clear that this is a reference to his ""alternate facts"" bs and that I don't actually consider him to be an intellectual... not sure if the downvotes were because that wasn't clear or what... in regards to his disdain for the arts, he's possibly looking to [defund/eliminate the national endowment for the arts, and the national endowment for the humanities](http://www.snopes.com/2017/01/19/trump-plan-nea-neh/). it hasn't happened yet, but given how quickly he makes and implements policy, i'm already very on edge. And I believe that that was written with the intention of meaning the left party, rather than left individuals To be fair, I wasn't the guy you were originally responding to. But yeah I'd agree with you. >  For clarity, what I meant here is social democracy which I place under the umbrella of socialism.  It's not under socialism in any way as it's market capitalism. Again, you don't know what words mean. Not even your presidential candidates. This is what generations of relentless extreme  right wing brainwashing does to a population.      >  I understand you may disagree on the use of socialism that way.    It's not a matter opinion. And don't even begin to give me that pseudo-intellectual ""language changes"" crap.      The whole Sanders campaign was a clusterfuck in itself. What Sanders has done in congress is to support co-ops. You know, worker ownership of means of production within a capitalist representative democracy. Some might call that democratic socialism. Not the same as social democracy.      Then he tried to package social democracy under the same umbrella and call it socialism for some idiotic reason. Maybe he thought he could turn the McCarthyist propaganda on its head. It backfired spectacularly and now you think everything under the sun can be considered ""socialism"".    ""The Nordic model"" LOL. The ""models"" in Nordic countries vary vastly and you have no idea what you are talking about.  By your definition, US is even more ""socialist"" in many aspects than Sweden.  What people think doesn't make it any more correct.  Classical Liberalism and Neoliberalism are right wing ideologies.  Exactly. The neoliberal Washington consensus has led to the greatest leap in world living standards and the most rapid decline in poverty in all of history. What is radical about them? The famous airship was a german vessel and named after Hindenburg. [removed] I hear exactly what you're saying man. I am an aussie centrist and I find myself playing devils advocate about trump on this site a lot. The outrage over nothing is insane sometimes. But it's not worth it usually. Most just insult you or don't engage your points and just keep on with hyperbole. It's tiring man, I know how you feel.  [removed] This response is... Borderline anti-intellectual.  Listen republicans are stupid when they use hyperbole and so are democrats. But right now its democrats who are rationalizing their own stupidity by going ""buut buuut but THEY did it before!"". I thought you guys used the moral high ground and took the high road.  Slate, Salon, The Week... Your sources are more insane than the rhetoric they're criticizing. There's some truth to that. Though it's actually more a case of individual vs collective interest and how we represent political ideology in simple terms.  The left, at present, has become extremely collective with an authoritarian bent. In response, the right has become more individualist by comparison. I'm a staunch left individualist, which aligns closer with 'right wing' libertarian thinking than collectivist leftist thinking on the present scale and understanding of the terms (in the mainstream).  This is the result of shifting definitions of what ""left"" and ""right"" mean. More traditional liberalism is individualist, espousing rights of the individual, with classic conservatism being collectivist, with cultural norms taking the focus. But, over time, that axis has shifted as political narrative shifted in the last 10-20 years... maybe even before; I'm not quite sure. So, depending on what issue you talk to me about, I'll sound like one or the other on the mainstream scale, while the ""extreme"" views I actually hold slide off into obscurity because they aren't represented on that axis, and instead get called radical  which I suppose they are, in some ways.  It's the fallacy of trying to map political identity on a two (or even three) dimensional scale. In fact, you have to look at both extremes: individualists (who take certain issues and form opinions on them, usually quite complex and often contradicting ones) and collectivists (who assume collective identity that is set forth and which they adhere to as closely as possible) and then account for the fact that most people fall somewhere in between these categories. We don't have any way to model this as it's an asymmetric map. ""left vs right"" is a terrible over-simplification of what political opinion actually looks like.  And that isn't even factoring in various categories of opinion (economic, government, human rights, etc) which skew the picture even more. It's just too complex to handle statistically IMO, hence this very simplistic view, which doesn't often align with what is really there. Good point, but in the U.S.'s limited political system, they are the left. (Socialists are practically a fringe group with barely any political presence.) >The left is done as long as it keeps the immigration narrative as it is today. Right or wrong a lot of people don't want to live next to iliterate people from Thrid World countries or suffer the effects they have on the economic situation of the less fortunated already there.   What the fuck kind of socialist do you think you are describing immigrants as broadly illiterate, or simply blaming immigrants for our problems that any decent socialist should be in solidarity with?  A socialist who blames other workers, immigrant or not, is not one  I recognise. It is precisely by not questioning these things you play into the nationalism, not by accepting them and stoking peoples fears.  >Also, I think wanting to control the media is definitely enough. Proposals like ""Opening up libel laws"" so that he can sue people who lie about him are extremely troubling, especially when he calls so many things that are objectively true, down to his inauguration attendance, lies.   While I generally agree, he wants to open up the libel laws so he can sue people who tell the truth about him. Can already sue for lies.   An ultra-libertarian would take the same action, but an ultra-libertarian is far from a fascist. The Democratic party is just the Democratic party. It isn't the Left party.  I mean, the Republican party was originally the progressive one.  The assumption that the political parties are fundamentally left or right is based on ignorance, not fact.  Confusing Democrat with Left has caused a lot of current issues. Okay, so do what I suggested and ignore my use of socialism, since it's so goddamn distracting.  Are the positions of social democracy not *leftist*? That's the core issue under debate here. Hahahahah man! You are on fire my man! These comebacks are craZy! Ouch, check me into a burn center amiright? Lol risky click Why Frank? I think its sarcasm. It's reducto ad abusdium, actually.  You take the essential bits of an argument and stretch them to their absurd, but ultimately logical conclusions.   Finding three similiarties in multi-thousand point policy plans and going ""THEY'RE FUNDAMENTALLY THE SAME"" is in itself anti-intellectual.   The correct argument would be  ""There are multitudes of differences, some large, some small on various scales but where the parties agree are X, Y, and Zed.""  And I would agree with that argument.    To say both parties are exactly the same because of three similar policy points, is in itself vaguely anti-intellectual.   There is no ""you guys"", there is just a collective ""us"". Everyone's in this together. Stop picking sides. It's the first Google results and while they are biased, their quotes are true sources.  Liberals are more likely to talk about Republican hyperbole.  Big surprise.  It doesn't make it untrue though.   CNN was also cited. Which is why no one cares about what they have to say.  It's also why Bernie's ""political revolution"" is little more than the left wing tea party.  Nutters gonna do what nutters gonna do. Well, in order to sue for libel he would have to prove that they are lies, and that the people saying it were aware of that fact.  I imagine he would just like to relax those requirements.  > an already sue for lies.  This is an absurd over simplification. You need to prove intent beyond any reasonable doubt. Well from my analysis of current policy, the democratic party is the most progressive/left of the two main American parties why are you argueing when apparently you're the only one who misunderstood OP? Intentionally misunderstanding which of the two major parties in the United States is considered 'the left' is willful ignorance for the sake of making a point. You knew what he was talking about.  The argument you are replying to would be more charitably represented as such:  Parties A and B differ with respect to issues 1, 2, and 3, and differ greatly, but not with respect to issues 4, 5, and 6, with respect to which parties A and B are politically identical. Issues 4, 5, and 6 are of great relative importance, where as issues 1, 2, and 3 are of minor importance. It follows that parties A and B are *close* to the same in any sense that matters, no matter if they have trivial (but nonetheless wide) differences in how they treat issues 1, 2, and 3.  Of course, it is worth voting even for trivial improvements over the status quo and against further regression. that's not how reductio works. Reductio ad absurdum is something else entirely, and is actually a valid type of argument. Mathematical proofs by contradiction are a type of reductio ad absurdum.  A straw man argument is when you use reductio ad absurdum to disprove/denounce something that is *similar* to what you actually want to disprove, and hoping that people won't notice that you didn't argue against what you were supposed to disprove, but against something superficially similar to it.

"14",13,"5r7b1y","2017-01-31","Ditching the dollar by Iran isn't a big deal in itself, but could be a huge deal if other countries start to do likewise.  Oil is priced in dollars, so states hold USD to buy oil.  If there's a unilateral switch to (say) EUR, then that will be the currency everyone needs to hold, and that would mean dumping of dollars and sharp devaluation (and all that entails like even more dumping, devaluation, dilution of bond value, and affect credit rating, etc etc...)  So it's not a big deal in isolation, but absolutely watch this space as it could have huge effects Trump is the greatest gift in the world to China's de-dollarization agenda.   I'm sure they can't believe their luck that Americans would so-willingly handicap themselves like this. A lot of people pinching themselves over in Beijing.

Uh oh. Trying to abandon the dollar historically doesn't end well for countries. I see a lot of well armed terrorist attacks in Iran's future. ditching dollars is what lead to Saddam and Gadafhis demise Iran has been moving away from the US dollar since at least 2003. Prices are still listed in US dollars, but Iran requests payments be made using other currencies. Most of their oil exports go to China, with whom they have a deal to be paid with yuan or through an exchange of goods.  I'm surprised how prevalent the ""Iraq and Libya were invaded because they wanted to ditch the dollar"" conspiracy theory is. Both countries had dismal relationships with the US long before they ever considered such plans. Their desire to ditch the dollar was a reaction to aggressive actions taken by the US. The US was already preparing to invade, they were just waiting for an opportunity. In the case of Gaddafi, I doubt anyone in the US government actually thought his gold-backed currency idea would ever go anywhere. This is good for bitcoin. Didn't they threaten to stop using the Dollar like a million times already? Iran is itching to do this for decades, and the ban (witch is mostly good for Iran, as the US are draining its brains) is just another excuse. Exactly like republicans want.  Where is the doomsday clock at? Just what Dugin and Putin wanted... I wonder what effect Trump will have on China-Iran relations. It was already quite good, but this will just boost it. Great move.   the Irani people are surprisingly western. They used to dress western and  act western .  They had an elected president Mossadeq, who we and the Brits overthrew for his oil. We installed a brutal dictator who looted and abused his people for 2 decades.     Why the Iran governments does not trust America is such a mystery. We have been embargoing them and threatening war since Bush.  yet the people are peaceful and not haters, like we are. You can always find a nut hater and pretend he speaks for the whole country. A smart move as well, us politics making the dollar unpredictable. Like I predicted Trump is accelerating the decline of American hegemony. It is pretty ironic that he was voted in by rabid nationalists.  Why would they even use the dollar standard, having all kinds of actual resources to trade? If partners require agreements be made in dollars, then buy them specifically for them using your actual resources, and that's the end of it.  The Iranians have tried to sell their oil in other currencies a few times. The Iranian Oil Bourse was one such attempt. The US$ , like it or not, is used by The House of Saud, so it would take a majority of OPEC to switch. The Chinese hold too much US$ denominated debt to allow the US$ to tank. It's PR for their own citizens, I think. Looks like Iran and Thailand are about to experience a new wave of freedom and democracy. I had no idea that Iran even used the American dollar. Seems odd given their government's dislike of the U.S.  This is how you get a war.  This is a great way to have some freedom and democracy dropped all over your oil rich country. do you want to get invaded...because that is how you get invaded......see Saddam and Qaddafi if you have any questions  Very good, other countries should start doing so as well. So I guess we'll be invading Iran soon. I suspect they have WMd's This could put pressure on the all mighty global driver: the Petro-Dollar.  Governments have been toppled for this.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djwPqAJ_3GY Oil rich countries that say they plan to ditch the dollar all have one thing in common...a visit from the Freedom Express. http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/31/politics/us-iran-missile-test/  Ooh no ... said the US I hope they do and all other nations do  We have to use our local currencies or gold instead of fake valued dollar And China soon becomes the number 1 nation in the world. Isn't this a very big deal? The US is where it is right now only because the world accepts US as the reserve currency. Oh no, what a nakba. I bet Trump is really kept up at night over the loss of our good friend Iran. ""Press TV is a 24-hour English language news and documentary network, affiliated with Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting. IRIB is state-owned but independent of the Iranian government in its management, and is the only legal TV and radio broadcaster inside Iran.""  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_TV  The current monetary system is only as good as the most stable producer. It all started with Bretton Woods but then.  From wiki..On 15 August 1971, the United States unilaterally terminated convertibility of the US dollar to gold, effectively bringing the Bretton Woods system to an end and rendering the dollar a fiat currency.[2] This action, referred to as the Nixon shock, created the situation in which the US dollar became a reserve currency used by many states. At the same time, many fixed currencies (such as the pound sterling, for example) also became free-floating.  And another from wiki...In monetary economics, fiat money is an intrinsically valueless object or record that is widely accepted as a means of payment.[3] In some micro-founded models of money, fiat money is created internally in a community making feasible trades that would not otherwise be possible, either because producers and consumers may not anonymously write IOUs, or because of physical constraints.  > Iran says it is preparing to stop using the dollar in its official statements  *a move that had been in the offing but appears to have been expedited*  How terrible! That Trump guy is awful!  > Bloomberg in an analysis said Irans decision to drop the dollar could prove to be complicated for the country given that its most important export is oil which is priced in dollars.  > Iran, it said, is on course to earn $41 billion from oil sales this fiscal year. Switching its reporting to another currency will add a degree of currency risk and volatility, Bloomberg warned.  Oh look, nothing's really changing but the paperwork. hyperinflation awaits If the world dumped the dollar and the US was on the verge of a massive economic collapse it would likely start WW3 as desperate nations do desperate things.    Conversely, if the US goes bankrupt so does the rest of the world as we consume 25% of the worlds resources and the global economy absolutely depends on the US as one of the key support pillars in this regard. If we go the world goes with it so nations should tread very carefully before they become the catalyst of their own destruction. So the country that has ""Death to America"" as one of its primary national chants/policies, is upset over a travel ban of their citizens to America and will stop using American currency. Good, the sooner US hegemony is broken the better off the world will be. Why is anger building about this? Seems like a ban on Trump would be something the country would want.  There's something fucking hilarious to me about Iran using the dollar at all. Does North Korea use it too? I gotta admit, I pretty much support whatever response Iran has at this point.  It's unreal that trump made such a disrespectful executive order.  Better ban us Canadians now, we've just had another act of terror committed by one of our own.    It was an act against Muslims though, so it probably isn't on trump's mind, given he less-than-secretly supports receiving votes from the xenophobic alt-right. So, totally hypothetical question, if a bunch of countries bailed on the dollar, what's the most likely currency to take over? The Euro? Base it off of gold? Should it be the most expensive currency now (like the , not sure if it's the most expensive but I know it's like 2.2$ USD or something).   I'm just curious.  Incoming petrowar!  ...  That's what happens, right, Reddit? /s Oooh. That's just asking to be invaded...   I'd be careful if I was iran. It's talk like that which got a few countries ""freedomized"". Here we go!!!! Look at what happened to other countries the just whispered about dropping the the dollar. I'm so FUCKIN tired of war.  Iran to gain FREEDOM(tm) from 'MURICA! As far as i can see the immediate effect of this will be rise in oil prices for our country as iran would not be dealing in $ the demand and supply would get disturbed  Again?  Just in time for the halal internet they have been working on.  It is hardly a new plan and while it makes plenty of sense the reality is that all those ""alternate"" economies rely on working together with other countries that really don't like each other very much.   Sure Russia Iran can decide to use mutual currencies. And what? Both end up with worthless currencies of each other?  The dollar is spendable anywhere, you can sell in Japan and buy in Brazil with the dollar. It is the reason it is the currency of choice from criminals. It is the reason black markets use the dollar.  Maybe Iran shouldn't be funding terrorist and threatening Israel. ITT: The mentally handicapped spouting Infowars talking points about Bush invading Iraq to save the petro-dollar. Saddam dumped the PetroDollar...then the US invaded and Saddam got whacked.  Gaddafi dumped the PetroDollar and created his own currency...got bombed by US/NATO...$hillary Rotten Clinton even laughed about it like the evil jackal she is.    http://ftmdaily.com/preparing-for-the-collapse-of-the-petrodollar-system-part-3/ When did they agree to use the dollar in the first place? Except the billions Obama gave them of course. Thought they were always going on about using the Euro when they were let back in the  play house.  Empty threat-oil (Iran's main export) is priced in dollars. There's no way to actually ditch it. LOL, ok.  There have been plenty of stories about financial chaos.  What has been created in generations past can hardly be blamed on Trump.  If anything, he will soften the blows of what lies ahead. Annnnnd..No one cared...Time to devalue the Dinari again I suppose... Don't worry, they try to ditch the almighty a few times a year only to come crawling back to repent and ask for forgiveness at exchanges.  Currency is fungible.   While this makes for a great headline, practically speaking it doesn't do a lot.   Have dollars but want to buy Iranian products?   The second before you buy you can convert it at a forex bank to whatever and buy.   Receive some other currency for selling goodes?   Convert at a forex bank. Seems like a silly symbolic action by Iran that will only hurt themselves. Peg the fossil fuels to bitcoin already! Does that mean we can have the $400 million back? iran want their citizen to migrate to america? the great satan? they want to drain the best of the best of their people to evil america? Israel has an absolute right to defend itself. historically(well at least over the past 20-30 years) this comes about 6 months before they have a mysterious revolution, and the US bombs the shit out of them. It goes beyond petrodollars, because the dollar is a reserve currency.  That is getting threatened by the Euro and RMB right now, especially as countries increasingly sign on to direct currency swaps instead of denominating their trade in US dollars.  The fact that so many dollars are in circulation through global trade is one of the reasons why the US is able to run such large governmental and trade deficits without feeling much of an apparent impact. Didn't we go into Iraq when they tried to nationalize the oil and switch off the dollar? Finance guy here, used to work in investment banking, the will not change commodity prices to trade in things other than the dollar in our lifetime. At the end of the day, regardless of what you think about our current leaders policies, it is the most stable, available currency in the world.   There's legitamite talk of the EU breaking up if another one or two large countries have a brexit like thing. Remember all the talk about the Euro being dissolved with Greece, Spain, Portugal needed bailouts. I guess other stable ones like the swiss frank, Canadian dollar, AUD, would be plausible as they are fairly stable, but you have a real supply/demand issue. Maybe the Euro or Chinese have the scale for something like global commodity circulation, but traders wouldn't trust China and it would never happen.    Ironically, a massive devaluation of the US$ could be a boon for the manufacturing-focused policies of the current government. A low dollar would have the effect of making US goods cheap to export.   The flipside is that it means US businesses and consumers would lose a ton of purchasing power, and risk falling behind on being able to buy goods themselves, upgrade technology and buy assets in other countries.  would you put your money in trump? neither would people with money. You're pretty much just telling us why the US is in the Middle East in the first place. Regional influence and to keep that petro-dollar  Pretty sure Trump wants to devalue the dollar to increase exports. Actually, Iran signed a number of deals last year which while priced in dollars will settled in Euros. If others follow suit, the need for dollar reserves will diminish even more.  It also allows the US to essentially export it's inflation to anyone that has to import oil This is at least the half a dozenth time Iran has threatened to leave the petrodollar. We were looking at in some bonds, but considered holding out since they're consistently increasing faster than the guaranteed rate... But a quick sharp fall in the dollar wouldn't work out well... Another 7-10 years of investing there doesn't look too promising to me And then it's a threat to our country, our well being, so we'll *have* to bring freedom back to those poor States! It's meaningless, whether they go solo or do it as a group. Oil is paid for in all major currencies, and that has been the case since forever.  I think everyone knows the importance of reserve currency, and if you don't educate yourself. Gadaffi tried this.  Didn't end well.  I've been considering buying usd right now. Is it a good time or not?  > If there's a unilateral switch to (say) EUR  And that would be very useful for EU to stabilize their pluging currency. Highly doubt anyone is going to turn to the EUR. Befor that happens they will get invaded. > ...  If there's a unilateral switch ...  You probably mean ""unanimous"" or ""multilateral"".  ""Unilateral"" means one-sided - in other words Iran switching away from dollars while nobody else does is a unilateral move. The United States honestly deserves whatever comes out of this, the stupid Trump voters stuck their hands into something they didn't understand now they'll feel the repercussions.  Anyone ditching the dollar is a huge deal. I'm not sure why this comment is voted so high. Especially oil controlling/contributing countries of merit. Oil is priced in US dollars atm. OPEC, and other nations, can come together and change that. Which breaks the faith and power of the dollar destabilizing it and our way of life. This is another reason why oil has been so important.  I think this is covered/addressed in crash course economic and parts of crash course history. Iraq was about to switch to the Euro and that caused Bush to invade Iraq and kill Hussein. I wonder how Trump will react  didn't Saddam want to switch to EUR? and Gaddafi to a gold currency?   that worked out fine for them This is exactly what Putin wants Trump to do, he's causing chaos in the international markets which will cause the value of the dollar to plummet. This will in tun cause the relative price of oil to go up (it will take more dollars to buy the same amount of oil), which will bring more money to oil exporters. Couple that with trump dropping sanctions against Russia, and I'd say Putin got a hell of a deal for 20% of RosNeft. I just hope we will eventually find out he gave trump worthless class w shares. Isn't that why they ousted Ghadafi too? I heard he wanted to sell oil for a unified African currency. I also thought this was the reason for the United States attempting to isolate Russia. I think they have a comparable amount of oil to Saudi Arabia but there's no way they would ever sell for dollars while other countries did.  as long as Saudi Arabia only accept dollars for its oil, you will not find oil priced in anything but dollars on the open market. NBD? you have no idea. Libya stopped using the dollar look what happened.  Leaving the petro-dollar has proven to be a fatal mistake for many. It would take care of our student loan problem though. The USA makes most of fits Capital from the exchanging of currencies, into dollars, to buy oil every day. Think of the volume.....if countries no longer are forced to buy dollars first, the USA economy takes a Huge hit Could this strengthen the euro ? No nation in their right mind would switch to the Euro right now. At least no non-european nation.   It's not making the news anymore, but most of the problems in the EU were just kicked down the road, not solved.   We don't even know if the Euro will still exist in 10 years The US military would get involved if this ever became a possibility.  People thinking the US would just sit around as the petrol dollar disappeared are misinformed or naive as shit. > Trump is the greatest gift in the world to China's de-dollarization agenda. >   Also killed TPP which, whatever you feel about its domestic impact or popularity, was about hemming in China.  Are we sure this Putin thing isn't just a diversion from his real beneficiary? Or does he work a bunch of part-time jobs?  > de-dollarization agenda  im from Australia...  dollarization fucked us over so many times... it needs to fucking go.. If I recall, they tried to get the USD taken out of the equation in favor of a gold standard, but apparently, that idea didn't go as far as North Korea's last missile. Iran and Russia have been selling oil for Yuan for years.  It's really not a big deal.   The bigger danger to Iran is a significant terror attack on US soil, especially if the perpetrators are either Iranians or ""Iranians"".  That was before all of our government bureaucracy were subject to the Trump coup.  I feel like Iran is safe from that at this point. I'm assuming you're alluding to Libya. And after the backlash Americans gave president Obama over the possible invasion of Syria, we won't let the government invade Iran either. Iran is not Iraq, and Trump does not have the team that Bush did or the public support.  Looks like we'll be going to war with Iran in the next four years.  This needs to be remembered. Iran brain drain...you don't hear that very often...have an upvote. Do the ""people"" support throwing homosexuals off buildings? Nothing investors like more than added risk. lol have you looked at other currencies over the last decade, nothing has been more predictible than the dollar, maybe a few outliers from small countries, but they don't have nearly the scale. USD, Euero, and RMB are the only three with possibly the scale. And the world is not going to accept China as their main currency. No matter how much they dislike our current president.   If you think otherwise you need to go take some economics classes and understand monetary policy. There's never been any major shock to our currency, never been a threat of us doing some major minipulation beyond normal monetary policy changes, USA using it as leverage over other countries, not paying our debts, or some major shock to it's value because of a huge economic event. Yes it fluctuates, sometimes largely, but relative to the rest of the world it is by far the best option and will not stop being that, at least in our lifetime. Or maybe until china actually has a full constitutional republic/democracy like the USA/Euro. Well, no, it's not necessarily a smart move. Just like a too volatile corporate stock, a too volatile currency is not a good long term investment. Sure, it can be good for risky day trading, but that's a different story. International standard, given the current economic dominance (stability) of the US Because of OPEC almost all countries that export oil sell it under the USD.   Thus forcing countries that want to buy their oil to keep stockpiles of USD on hand.   Because of this almost all countries keep a stockpile of the US dollar to conduct international trade.   Because the USD is the worlds reserve currency it remains more stable/stronger than almost all other currency.  In the end it almost doesn't matter what your countries stance on the US is, you have to have a pile of USD.     Iran is 4 times the size of Iraq and the population is 80 million, opposed to 35. Got a lifetime of wars you have not used? We do not need to invade another middle east country. Don't you tire of blood and death? No, Iran's share of US dollars is minimal so it won't affect much. And with uncertainty in the EU and the Chinese economy slowing the US dollar is still the strongest reserve currency for the foreseeable future. That is unless Trump does something to change that. The best part, TIL country that hates us uses our dollar. yea. ok. Gold seems to be the most stable currency that the markets rely on, so I assume it could be that if the euro and yuan fail to step up. Both are guilty for aggression. Israel isn't some innocent bystander.  Not a helpful game to play when Israel has expansionist policies - that creates a huge amount of tension in the region Maybe the US and Israel should do the same instead of being fucking hypocrites. I'd like to say that, but we need to get the Republican majority congress to agree with us. Not saying it's impossible, but it'll take more than one mistake. That's a declaration of war as far as us goes. Anyone who's done that against us has seen our folks drop some freedom on them. Fucking republicans and aipac just couldn't let the peace deal w Iran go thru. Got to start a war or fuck Iran up Not yet, need to get some first. It was Iranian money frozen by the US government decades ago. They paid for US weapons, the 1979 islamic revolution happened and the US froze those funds - no weapons were ever given. Ditching any currency is the sovereign right of any country. It's more of a targeted attack. Many diaspora Iranians have relatives in Iran or vise versa. So do Palestinians. What does that have to do with anything? Are you sure you're in the right thread Many if them have oil, so I'd guess Iran, Iraq and Libya. 3: Iran, Iraq and Libya. the only country that matters in opec is saudi arabia Of course I oversimplified, but yes, the US credit rating and artificially low deficit position can only be harmed by people dumping USD.  It's had a great historic run, so great that many think it's normal and since forever and so will always be this... but runs end.  I'm not calling this the end of the dollar as a major world currency by any stretch of the imagination, just flagging that USA has come to rely on almost free credit. no it's not. At the core of it commodities will never trade in anything other than USD in our lifetime. It's the only currency that's stable enough that has the scale to facilitate the trade on a global scale. No fucking way are traders/countries going to accept china having that much control/influence over their economy by making the chinese yuan their main currency reserve/trading vehicle.   And the Euro has had it's fair share of uncertainty, Remember 5 years ago when Greece, spain, Portugal were needing bailouts, and there was talking about countries just leaving the Euro so they could print their own currency again. Talks about just one or two EU members having a brexit could destroy the currency. Not that I think that will happen, but it's a much more real concern than the relativley small moves in the dollar.   Talking about our credit rating is dumb as fuck, the only time it ever was effected in recent history was because of dumb political shit with the debt ceiling that everyone called as a political stunt, there was no chance we ever wouldn't pay our interest on bonds. And if you think trumps rhetoric about ""oh we could just stop paying interest on our treasury notes/bonds, wink wink, nudge nudge"", yeah thats just Bs rhetoruc. But even if it does cause some volitality look around the world and see dozens of countries who have followed through on those threats. China's manipulation of their currency far beyond simple monetary policy, latin/south american countries refusing to pay bondholders in the United states because they are just evil investment bankers, various currencies having triple digit moves in the face of economic hardship.   Nothing is more safe and predictable than the dollar in the world. Maybe like the swiss franc or AUD, but those don't have near the scale. Even the swiss franc though, they decide to not peg it's cap to the dollar, and kind of let it float on it's own, major swing.   This headline is just some BS clickbait. Also the executive has very little control over the Monetary policy. The Euro is hardly a threat these days, with the existence of the EU itself being an open question.  We'll see after France and Italy's elections. The RMB isn't threatening anything as long as it is controlled by China. Bitcoin has a better chance of replacing the USD than the RMB. No country is going to accept the RMB as a reserve currency or even a medium of international trade, since its value is, for all intents and purposes, set by the edict of the Chinese Government.  If something is to replace the US dollar as the preferred medium of trade, that something will need to have its value transparently set by some kind of market mechanism.  One could propose a return to the Gold standard, but that would somewhat limit the ability of Governments worldwide to inflate their way out of sovereign debt. Yes, in the year 2000 Saddam Hussein stated he would primarily trade in Euro / PetroEuro instead of Dollar / PetroDollar.  'Strangely enough' or 'the greatest geopolitical coincedence of all human history', 9/11 then occurs in the next year 2001 by Saudi Arabian terrorists (important to note the Petrodollar was initially set-up directly between Saudi Arabia and America in the 1970s). America then attacks Iraq and Afghanistan instead of Saudi Arabia and by 2003 Iraq are suddenly trading in Petrodollar again. Naturally Saddam Hussein dies.  Next Petrodollar history lesson; Gaddafi started to support a gold backed African currency they could trade with, naturally Gaddafi, the theorised richest man in the world dies.  Iran has been wanting to ditch the dollar for awhile, but in the meantime America are constantly bombarding Iran with sanctions to cripple Irans banks to pressure them into remaining to trade with Dollar.  Syria also did not trade in Petrodollar, naturally after it's destabilisation, bombings, sanctions and invasions it does.  But eh yeh...it's a conspiracy amirite. If you have any semblence of expertise in Geopolitics, this area of it *is the basics.*  In terms of modern history; America is becoming more self sufficient, the Petrodollar is weakening and I imagine their relationship will possibly begin to fracture more as time goes on, although Saudi Arabia is a great American Proxy versus' Iran and likewise so i imagine it will always stay friendly. Countries like Great Britain and France who are less self sufficient will continue to suck Saudi Arabian Penis for quite some time, which if you've been paying attention at all has been happening.  Countries like China and Russia are beginning to trade with each other in their own currencies and are pressuring other countries to do so such as Saudi Arabia is currently being Tug of War'd between China and America to trade in Yuan and Dollar respectively, naturally the western propaganda machine is currently making sure we see China and Russia as the great boogeymen. ..and Libya, and Syria. The US will also manipulate elections in south american countries if theres a runner thats against the dollar. No. But we did overthrow the democratically elected government of Iran when they nationalized the Oil fields in the 60's. Only according to the dumb r/conspiracy petrodollar theory. Doesn't this all assume people act rationally? Really seems like people are not acting very rationally right now.  And the EU breaks up, it'll make the Dollar even stronger. There's nothing beside the Euro that comes close to the stability, liquidity, and availability of the Dollar.  Probably you're right, but we don't know the future.  We couldn't imagine in '84 that not only would the cold war end, but the Berlin Wall would fall within 5 years.  Things can change unpredictably and surprisingly quickly. Once the current German population gets to the retirement age, then the EU will fall apart.  Isn't our GBP stable enough for you...  :( Lol CAD is stable? Since when?  I think your claims are empty. Once the OPEC countries have changed (see Iranian contracts with Total etc) or been forced to change their contracts to settlement in Euros, changing the pricing to Euros is a short step away.  Yep, since Brexit cost GBP around 20% so far, and we've not even signed yet, overseas holidays look very expensive this year. > The flipside is that it means US businesses and consumers would lose a ton of purchasing power  Loss of purchasing power + repercussions from a trade war with Mexico that could get us kicked out of the WTO = doomsday.   We'll be Russia within 5 years. I guess some will find that comforting.  If you think the USD is going to devalue against EUR, yes you can buy EUR, wait, and sell them back for more dollars.  Two risks -   1) You may be wrong, and EUR may tank against USD 2) Exchange fees x2 will eat into your profits for small amounts (you could use Revolut if it's legal in your country to get low-cost exchange, or take a chance with BTC) If you're going to do that then just open up a Forex trading account online and it will be much easier Nobody knows, you're simply gambling It would, for any currency, even RUB or RMB.  Just there's nothing inherent in USD that makes it magically unique You're correct! TYVM >  I wonder how ~~Trump~~ Bannon will react   FTFY  >and that caused Bush to invade Iraq and kill Hussein  No it didn't.   Stop spouting nonsense.    Iran is not Iraq.  I think it's fair to say there were other factors, and them wanting to switch was a symptom of a bigger situation Iraq and Libya had awful relations with the US long before they announced any desire to change currencies. Their desire to switch was a reaction to aggressive actions by the US. The US was just waiting for an opportunity.  Also, I doubt anyone in the US government at the time actually thought Gaddafi's plan would get off the ground. muh Rosneft conspiracy... you will parrot anything thats anti-trump right? Probably some of that, but these pictures are a lot more complex and layered than this --> that. Maybe, although Venezuela and Iran both traded in EUR in some contracts, it's hardly without precedent Maybe. Might look less of a mess than it did a year ago in comparison with the alternatives.  Nobody knows for sure. Unimportant - I gave it as an example.  RMB if you prefer, or RUB. The article specifically says it could be a basket of currencies. They can just pick half a dozen currencies of countries they do the most business with, then come up with some weighted average of that. It would automatically rule out the dollar since they don't do much business with the US. Their major exposure to the dollar is just the oil sold, and that's exactly what they're planning to change. It will, there is little sentiment for the end of the EU in its member states. Even if a few do feel like they'd be better off without the EU, there are still many states that will remain. Just for clarity, that's exactly the self-serving and aggressive attitude that the enemies of USA feed upon. I wondered about that myself, honestly. The fact is it'd take an immense amount of hubris for the Russians to follow their publicly available playbook, aka, Foundations of Geopolitics. However, another country could easily follow that playbook to scapegoat the Russians. >Also killed TPP which, whatever you feel about its domestic impact or popularity, was about hemming in China.  At the cost of American jobs. It was a gambling proposition:  * Enact TPP = Export American jobs for the chance at possibly reigning in China somewhere down the line (which may or may not happen anyway)  * Don't enact TPP = Bet chance at reigning in China (which may or may not happen anyway) and preserve American jobs   Reigning in China was the part of that whole thing that wasn't assured either way, but the status of US jobs was guaranteed based on what path you took.  We are a service industry nation now, TPP was using that job market as the sacrificial lamb like NAFTA and other FTAs had used our manufacturing industry to gain a stronger grip on manufacturing countries by making them dependent on us for the majority of their export market.  There are other things we can do to reign in China, TPP wasn't the only card in our deck. They didn't know he would be so stupid to indirectly help China. It is a nightmare trying to set up an International online business outside of the US because of dollarisation.  Russia has the GDP of California.  They're not as big of a deal as they'd like to be.  And America has does everything in their power to cripple them asides from military force.  Who is we and how do you plan in stopping it? lol what?  We are itching for an excuse to cripple Iran. We just won't try nation building this time around.  I don't think Trump got the memo about public support. Watch yer ass Persia... Iran will not be as easy as Iran, which was weaken by sanctions for years before Bushs attack.  Public support or not, its Trump where dealing with. wont be easy  war never is history that is not remembered, repeats itself   Nope. They do not. Do Americans support shooting up a gay night club? We almost defaulted under Obama because of politics and now there's an actual  lunatic in charge. It's very unpredictable for sure. It was sarcasm.  Sounds like you agree with me? Ah ok. Got it. Thanks.  Got it. So that is a positive for us? (U.S.) i was just saying countries who tired to move away from us dollar hegemony were attacked under other pretenses.... That's because oil is priced and sold in dollars. Eventually they will get tired of losing I suppose. Dude you post in altright... Holy shit the Pound went WAY down since I last looked.  What do you mean by ""step up""? Would the EU have to do something?  I'd be an aggressor too , if I was constantly attacked. Israel is surrounded by hostile Muslim countries. They can't afford to appear weak, strength is the only thing these people fear. Given Trump's administration, it's more like ""alternative action"" There are no ""Palestinians"" only misplaced Jordanians. We literally went to war because Saddam was threatening to switch to EUR Cut the oil dependency and they can do whatever they want. At this point they have freedom from the USA. Win, win. And Syria. But they aren't exactly in a position to utilize their buried natural resources in the west of the country (because it's held by ISIS and the SDF mostly) Iraq doesn't really produce notable amounts of oil these days.  That's not true.  A question since you've read up on this, what happens to the USD once  the world weens largely off oil in a few decades? Certainly the next 50 years. > It's the only currency that's stable enough that has the scale to facilitate the trade on a global scale.  It's stable because the US government is stable. So, keep an eye on anything that might come along that seems to rock the US government boat. Their are good reasons for Iran to minimise trade in USD though, to the average person it looks like they're 'sticking it to the man' even if it makes no difference and can help them avoid the affects of US sanctions should they return.   For example to breach US sanctions you need to have a 'connection to the US', that could mean that you're a US citizen, US company or trading in US Dollars etc. Have a upvote for a well thought out post. I believe you are correct that these is click bait and anyone trying to get off the dollar is a bad move. Uh...if the past few months have been any indication things are neither certain or reliable in America anymore.  Uncertainty has taken over. What could happen right now is small stuff. Trivial stuff in the grand scheme. But it could set the ground work for it to grew and compete with the dollar in 50 years time.  That's enough time for the questions about instability of the European Union to be resolved, or for China to stop meddling with it's currency, or for something else to happen.  That's the real problem with Trump's rhetoric. It won't erode the USA's control today, or in 4 years. But it could encourage states to try to build something that could end up eroding it in 20 to 50 years. A lot of the world has become reliant on the USA and Trump is basically saying *""don't be.""*  If his presidency continues the way it's started then states are going to start planning a future which does not include the USA. Not to mention OPEC requires oil to be traded in US dollars and the US will go to war to make sure it stays that way.  Ask Libya how it worked out for them. > Yes, in the year 2000 Saddam Hussein stated he would trade in Euro / PetroEuro instead of Dollar / PetroDollar.  Iraqi oil was already being bought and sold everyday in other currencies, and that had been the case since forever.  It's just another bullshit internet ""story"".  Getting rid of the petro dollar would not entail the american economy to totally fail. It's my understanding that it hasn't collapsed due to the fact that the petro dollar exists. What would happen? not to mention trump doing all this shit so we forget about his conflicts of interest and he never did realize his tax returns - he's smart he doesn't pay taxes - this is your republican champion. And what's disturbing is trump is already very Anti Iran. His advisors are going to be pushing and pushing for war not to mention Israel and Saudi Arabia which he's already shown to be dedicated allies to It was 1953, and when it happened Mosaddegh had delcared special powers for himself that made his ""democratically elected government"" very much less so. He was jailimg political rivals and even dissolved their parliament in a rigged referendum. I disagree with American interventionism in the political affairs foreign nations as much as the next guy, but I constantly see this revisionist history regarding the Iranian coup on reddit, and it just isnt correct.  Please actually look up information if you're going to reference historical events, because the only thing your comment accomplishes is the dispersal of false information. I mean, at least get the decade right. That's not a conspiracy. Our entire middle East foreign policy objective is predicated on oil  lol. You have some learnin' to do.  Oh yes of course, please tell me where are Saddam's WMDs ? LOL conspiracy theory. Wow you know nothing of geopolitics, depressing really. this exactly, people don't seem to get it though. They think an exeuctive order that causes a fuss is going to destablize a currency that represents like half of the global money supply.   News flash, every president in modern history has done executive orders, department rulings, legal orders, etc that have sent shocks to the market in one way or another. Stability in a currency doesn't mean it doesn't rise or fall relative to other currencies, but even there when was the last time we had 400% inflation in one year like venuzalia. But the biggest thing in regards to stability is that you know the people at the top aren't fucking around with the numbers, like china does in their currency, that the availability and ability for it to be accepted by the vast majority of the world isn't threatened. Just like you said, but people seem to think because this president did stuff that now pisses off the other 50% of the country that the global financial markets are falling apart.   And through all that the global financial markets still used the dollar. I get reddit doesn't like trump, and I get they like fear mongering, and there's plenty of legitimate worries to have about the president, but our currency somehow going into a freefall is not one anyone should be worrying about.   Strong US dollar in regards to specific investments abroad sure, having an overall effect on imports/exports and the global economy absolutely, but that's just normal ebbs and flows of the global macro economy. But actually worrying about every country somehow abandoning it is as dumb as people saying Trump is a wild cannon waiting to lob some nukes at mexico. Stupid clickbait fear mongering.  or any other major financial shocks. At the domestic level being able to have your own monetary policy with currency actions is huge, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece. I'm not saying them having their own currency would have made their situation any better, but at least they would have had more control over it.   Remember all those Austerity measures that were forced, that wasn't the far right ""populist"" le pen type people forcing that. It was the EU and Eurozone bueracrafts that want this globalist one currency thing to work. England won't hurt the EU horribly because they were already on the pound, but if any of their members decides to leave, or go back on their own currency, which is very real again with the populist movements, toss in a recession and a needed bailout and some guy in Brussels tells all of spain or italy that things have to go this way, when no one in that country voted for them. All of a sudden the other side of it starts sounding a lot more convincing.   That's a much bigger schock to a currency like the EURO than a daily spike in the dollar index or some shit, or clikcbait shit like this.  should have thrown you guys in there my bad, one of the few actual good actors out there who at the end of the day will do whats best for everyone!  In the sense that their government isn't going to do blatantly illegal things like china in regards to their currency and economic status, lie about their money supply, destabilize markets with everything being valued in RMD, etc.  by stable I meant you can rely on the government and they are pretty much transparent when it comes to their currency, not so much how much the value of it fluctuates due to market forces. Saudi, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, venuzila, Nigeria and qatar are not going to demand oil trade in Euros. The currency it settles in could really mean less, the global markets will still peg it to the dollar. If you're buying $1million worth of oil and want them to pay in euros, then they will just pay in euros whatever the equivalent.  Also those are just deciding to use a differnet currency with one-on-one deals with smaller nations around the world. Plenty of countries do trade in various currencies, the USA keeps plenty of non USD reserves to do transaction with other nations.   To say that all of a sudden everyone is going to use the dollar or that global commodities are going to all of a sudden be pegged to the Euro od RMD is just dumb.  > We'll be Russia within 5 years. I guess some will find that comforting.   Well, if you have a president who wishes he could be Putin...  in private bilateral deals, not the open market, which would affect demand for dollars. That's fine. [Man that would be such a great twist if the Chinese were behind all of this all along.](https://i.redd.it/3bknkiv3vacy.jpg) No. It would have gone through with Clinton. And Iran's is much smaller.   2016 Russian GDP was over $1.2 trillion.  California is about $2.4.  I had no idea. Illinois, not California.  Also smaller than Italy's.   I too learned this statistic from a reddit comment Exactly, are there bigger boogeymen than Russia and Iran right now? The point is that using military force makes no sense, since this has proven to be unimportant.  The sanctions against Russia and Iran have nothing to do with how they sell their oil. I voted for trump and support the guy so far, the moment he even alludes to invading another country I will be the first person on the marches on Washington. Good luck with that. You'll find yourself burning all the bridges that the Iran Nuclear deal made. France has already declared that they will protect the deal no matter what America thinks of it. Haha he'll need it, though he may think he doesn't. The embers now, they'll be nothing compared to the fires we'd see.... Literal flames and not just metaphorical ones.  Did the US government shoot up a gay night club? Really? Who knew?! Defaulted what?  There was no danger of defaulting the dollar...  That would have been the collapse of the US and probably the world economy. Yes, an extreme positive.   Which means countries moving away from using the USD as a reserve/trading currency would hurt us. If they have no use for it they send it back to the US causing inflation and what not.   Some would say this is why countries who happen to move away or show interest in moving away from this standard just so happened to be invaded, or experience a revolution.   I know about that. That was why we overthrew Mossadeq. Iran has been trading oil in Euros and Yuan for a few years now. Pound Towne Idk if you've looked since the referendum but that had a fairly large toll on the pound I'll take a loss here. I don't know about the markets to know which currency is the most stable. I would assume (take these words as you will) that the EU could declare, just like China, to step up their economic presence, to push the use of the Euro with other countries outside of it.    Yeah, that's what both Israelis and Palestinians say. 'these people' We were preparing for war long before Saddam made any statements about switching to the euro. It was a reaction to, not a cause of, the aggressive behavior of the US. and Ghaddafi wanted to establish a gold standard. Wrong. Just plain misinformation.  Here's my two sources since people asked: http://foreignpolicy.com/2009/10/07/debunking-the-dumping-the-dollar-conspiracy/ Also: James Hamilton, PhD, Professor of Economics at the University of California, San Diego, stated in a Mar. 2, 2007 e-mail to ProCon.org: ""I am aware of no reputable economist who claims that whether payment for Iraq's oil is conducted in euros rather than dollars would have any significant effect on any variable of interest to the United States. It would not affect the dollar price of oil, it would not affect the U.S. balance of payments, it would not affect U.S. inflation, it would not affect U.S. interest rates, and it would not affect the U.S. money supply. A payment in dollars can perfectly well be made with 'Eurodollars', which refers to dollar-denominated deposits in foreign banks. These could be the assets of someone who does not live in the United States and the liabilities of a financial institution that is in no way affiliated with the United States, whose only connection to the United States would be the units (dollars) in which the account is maintained. Even if the payment were with actual U.S. dollars from a U.S. bank account, this at most introduces a strictly transitory demand for transactions balances whose effects are probably not worth discussing. To suggest that anyone in the current U.S. administration believed otherwise, and indeed was so attached to this nonsensical proposition that they would have advocated that the U.S. go to war on this account, can only be described as fervent attachment to a conspiratorial delusion."" He already had a couple years before.  At the time economists derided the measure as a foolish waste of revenues that would lose Iraq a lot of money just to spite the US.  In reality, because of the appreciation of the Euro, the move the the Euro made Iraq several billion between the switch and the invasion.  Of course this is not the main reason the US went to war, and the Petrodollar is just a part of the regime supporting the reserve status of the US dollar. More important are our enormous trade deficits.  While there are some direct benefits to controlling the reserve currency, there are drawbacks as well, and our economic development is pursuing an unbalanced trajectory that could greatly imperil our well-being in the event of a breakdown in international trade. That rumour needs to fucking die.  [removed] Shhh, don't say that too loudly This kind of thinking is backwards, though. Countries want to trade oil in dollars (where they can't get it in their local currency, of course) because it's stable, highly convertible, and used for a tremendous amount of other trades around the world; you're never going to be faced with a situation where you have dollars and nobody wants them.  The only countries that discuss trading oil in currencies that aren't the dollar are doing so for political, not economic reasons; i.e. they already don't like the US.  Thus, it's not like deciding to trade in some other currency is especially offensive to the US, it's just that the people who push it are mostly on our shit list for unrelated reasons. >Cut the oil dependency and they can do whatever they want. At this point they have freedom from the USA. Win, win.   That's not how economics works.   I feel like people like just say things sometimes...   ""Do X""  ""Doing X isn't possible in the short term and you're just going to cause more problems if you act like it is. ""  ""Let's do x anyway because it sounds good to me"" But the Trump administration is pro-oil. I agree with the idea of the US being less dependent on oil.  But oil will still matter a great deal to the US economy as long as a significant number of people in other nations rely on it. Sure, but America cutting dependency on foreign oil is about as likely as adopting a functional, fairly-priced socialized medicine policy. Even if we do that and they swap from the USD our dollar will still crash  This is the smartest thing ever said on Reddit. it is true. it's still the main currency for trade. It has little to do with just oil, all commodities that I know of trade to the dollar, most international contracts, are as well. Also the world isn't going to ween off oil in 50 years, the demand for it is growing. Regardless of if it's oil, solar, wind, all those things require some commodity to be purchased.   I'm not making a statement about future Forex rates, or the dollar going up/down against another currency or whatever. Just that the currency used to demonstrate most things that's most widely used as a reserve is not going anywhere. Oil, nat gas, metals, soy, corn, cattle, water, fucking whatever, the dollar will still be the main currency used to facilitate the transfer of goods and services in the global economy.  It get's tied to the next big thing because it's the most stable currency.   the last major shock to it was the late 60's when there was a gold/silver shortage and starting to see a US dollar shortage. you can't really point to any political rifts on the left or right that have caused major issues with it's stability. day to day valuation sure, 100%, but that really doesn't matter much. And when compared to the swings of other nations it's no where close to unstable.   very little of their trade was in USD anyway, as it was difficult for them to get consistent access to large quantities of our currency, and they sure as hell weren't buying our treasuries. One of the big benefits to their economy after the lifting of some sanctions was the ability go have access back to our currency and financial markets to some extent.  Thanks, I'm not saying that other countries won't become larger players and have more influence, where as in the past the US was the only player in town. But this hysteria/hope that for some reason the USA is now a third world country with no influence is just dumb thinking.   We could elect fucking mickey mouse, and when he calls your country on something serious you pick up the fucking phone. Yeah political protests and symbolic gestures of canceling visits will happen, shit like that's happened for hundreds of years. When real shit starts to happen that would have a major effect like a trade deal or military support, no one is goign to ignore the largest power in the world just because they want some quick internet points for going against the guy they don't like.  no, it hasn't. Obama was just as uncertain with his executive orders that rocked entire industries overnight. China instituting overnight a ban on how much money can leave the country, banning people from selling stock when the stock market is bad, minipulating their currency way beyond simple monetary policy. There being literal talks of the Euro no longer being a currency.   You do not have any of that in the united states. The important thing about having a common currency around the globe to trade things like commodities and value contracts in has very little to do with whatever political party is in control. It has to do with availability and clarity of the currency. That doesn't mean the value of the currency can't fluctuate, but we know the reason it is, normal market forces, perhaps in reaction to an executive order, sure. That's a lot different though than a dozen officials in Beijing saying ""do XYZ through a dozen shell organizations to destabilize our currency to have this effect on a commodity which will help our interests in countries ABC"".   At the end of the day control of the dollor is largley disconnected from the president and other politicians. Yeah they vote and appoint for the people who run the Fed, but there's a diverse system of governors so not even yellen has total control, along with tresury and the fact that our actions revolving the currency are very transparent.   what is a major risk to the availability and reliability of our currency being used. Trump says we are invading china tomorrow, markets go to shit, but there are still plenty of dollars floating around to be used as a tender for the transfer of goods and services. There's still a nation of 320 million that will accept your currency along with hundreds of countries around the world where it will be accepted and be able to move freely.   Even if you wanted to change the currencies used around the world none have the footprint and are beat into the system as much as the dollar. When's the lat time you paid for something in Chinese Yuan, outside of Asia and parts of Europe, maybe Africa. There are large areas of the world where the currency just doesn't have a presence at all, except from maybe the huge institutional level.   This is a stupid thing to be fear mongering or cheering over. All those things have literally no effect on the viability of the dollar as a mode of exchange of goods and services.  a lot of that on the foreign policy point happened in huge ways under Obama. Russia, china, Iran all having a large growing influence in the middle east. We left Israel in the dust, which is really the only true democracy in that region and provides the best way of stabilizing the region when issues happen.   Got involved in conflicts that had very little benefit to our national intrest, how the fuck Italy and France convinced us to get involved in lybia is still baffling to me. The fact that they didn't blink when Assad used chemical weapons and when Russia annexed crimea and then funded ""rebel' groups to invade western Ukraine. Shoot down a passenger jet, continues aggression from China in the south china sea. Been wishy washy on trade deals that strengthen our interests, let things expire or put in regulations/department policy that allows foreign competition to have a huge influence on the corporate spectrum. Passed that what the actual fuck of an Iran deal, meanwhile they just conducted their second ballistic missile test since the deal, that was supposed to stop that program... To say all of a sudden Trump's entirely responsible for less USA influence in the world is a fucking lie, considering the last president would toss away any leverage we had if it fit his interests at that moment.    I'm not in love with a lot of what trump has proposed, and the uncertainty does make me raise my eyebrows in the face of a lot of the things I'm excited that he might do on the economic growth front and actually getting productivity growth back.   The friends/clients I've got who work in the Aerospace/defense business, and who sometimes work with people connected to intelligence agencies said most breathed a large sigh of relief when clinton lost. Not that they are thrilled with the prospect of all trump will do, but from early conversations are convinced he will listen and let them do what they need.   He also hasn't just surrounded himself with yes men, many of his cabinet picks have openly disagreed with comments that the President have made. What you saw with Obama was him firing anyone that gave an opinion that no longer fit with his narrative at that point. The vibe i got from my friends were that he lacked a solid conviction as to run foreign policy. At least trump as the ""america first"", which is hilarious to me that people said that was somehow bad.   the special drawing rights? eh, possible you see some kind of blend contract that is made up of a bunch of currencies, but the only real reason those came to be was a shortage of reserve vehicles, largely gold and silver in the late 60's as well as some signs of a shortage of US dollars. There's only like 200 billion of these and they aren't actually traded I don't think. I'm pretty sure the IMF just issues them as they need. But like 50% of it is US dollars anyway, and the Chinese currency wasn't even added until 2016 and it's only like 10% I think? It's more based off of the ratio of these currencies circulating. So even more to my point, there's just so much more availability of the dollar.   The situation we have now is much different than then. I'll fully admit I can't predict a black swan event possibly having a similar effect, but the stuff other people in here are fear-mongering over and proposing are just frankly ridiculous.  no clue how the fuck France and Italy convinced us to get involved in Lybia, those were the only two countries that had a real national interest of ousting the old dictatorship. Regardless though OPEC countries want it in dollars. It's the most efficient, transparent, most stable and available currency in the world, and will stay that.   Again, as I said before, unless china decides to have a transparent constitutional republic, maybe in like 50 years they'd use that as the global currency, but I just don't see that happening. Opec isn't really the ones that have the leverage here either, the institutions around the world that buy their oil have it, regardless of their economies being so intertwined with the dollar, they can't just leave the dollar.   wow, must be dark where you stick your head. [removed] At worst, some companies would need to hedge some contracts, like they in the US and around the world for any contract written in a foreign currency, bankers would get slightly bigger bonuses for the easy cash that would be rolling in.  I mean look at the massive disaster that didn't happen when all of Europe moved to the Euro.  Imagine all the countries that hold trillions in US currency just to buy and sell oil, selling all of their American dollars at once. All sellers, no buyers.   You'll be sticking 100 dollar bills in your shoes for insulation because that is all it'll be good for.  blah blah blah I was off by 7 years.      >The 1953 Iranian coup d'tat, known in Iran as the 28 Mordad coup (Persian:   ), was the overthrow of the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in favour of strengthening the monarchical rule of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi on 19 August 1953, **orchestrated by the United Kingdom (under the name ""Operation Boot"") and the United States (under the name TPAJAX Project, or ""Operation Ajax"").** That's a complete lie, Middle eastern countries worshiped america until 1973 when america picked Israel and completely antagonized every person from morocco to Bangladesh. If america gave a shit about Oil and wanted a decent relationship with oil producing countries then they wouldn't have a single policy directed solely at israel. And this is coming from someone who hates Trump.   Looking at the S&P, Dow, Dollar, etc fucking two weeks into his presidency and making bold predictions is stupid.   > And through all that the global financial markets still used the dollar.  Because none of those things would have harmed the USD at all? If anything, they strengthened it... so I'm not sure what your argument is supposed to be here.  The dollar has nothing special or magical about it. It's the best choice right now, so people use it. If it stops being the best choice, everyone will move away from it. The end. Clearly, no one could possibly predict whether that is going to be the case in the future and if so when, beyond wild speculation. Just don't make the mistake of assuming it's invincible and unsinkable, because that's not the case. The current Canadian government is horrible with money. They may be good on other things, but they are bankrupting the country and most people in Canada want them out of power before the CAD is worth nothing. The CAD is anything but stable and investing in it with our current PM in power is foolish. > Saudi, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, venuzila, Nigeria and qatar are not going to demand oil trade in Euros.  Venezuelan oil is largely irrelevant to EU. Iraq will do whatever Iran tells them. And quite possibly it will be EU that demands external commodities contracts to be in Euros.   > Also those are just deciding to use a differnet currency with one-on-one deals with smaller nations around the world.   We are actually talking about deals between Iran and France&Spain here.  There were economists who also said the same thing about NAFTA, and were expecting the loss of factory jobs to be made up with the freedom of movement of labor and the free market. That never happened and there are many people in regions built around factory production who were never able to reenter the job force at either the same level of compensation they had previously, or at all.   So there were some regions who saw a great benefit (those not reliant on mass unskilled labor), and those who saw great loss. TPP would flip flop the impact on these regions, where regions that rely heavily on exporting services would be at most detriment, and regions that rely on manufacturing and agriculture to see the least amount of impact from enacting TPP.  Economists are not always right as they run on the same modus operandi as your weatherman. They look at trends and historical data, and make their best guess as to what will happen, and the accuracy drops the further out you look. So like your weatherman, what they predict in the long term should always be taken with a hefty grain of salt. Yeah, true. However, China is definitely happy about Trump abandoning TPP. About the same as Virgina.  Amazing. Ah yeah i forgot about the sanctions.    They did not treat the russian economy well.  California by itself has like the 5th highest GDP.  Depends who wins the French election...  The french president has like a 5% approval rating nothing he says is useful lol Lol. I misread it as ""liberal flames""...I swear I did...   Did Iran government throw a gay off a roof? Yes it would have and it almost happened a couple of times.  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-07/a-u-s-default-seen-as-catastrophe-dwarfing-lehman-s-fall As far as I understand it although the currency isnt the dollar the price is still based off the dollar price both for the dollar's stability as well as its prevalence for international trade. It was just after so I think it fell a little but didn't finish falling when I checked. I actually figured it would fall this far but I thought it would be more immediate.  And Palestinian are dumb because they keep trying to mess with the stronger country.  Go read some Arab media. The only thing they love more than killing each other is fantasizing about exterminating Jews and destroying Israel.  You can of course disagree with Israel's policies but they are dictated by Israel's location.  yet the end result ends the same.... nice spin btw. Russia and China have been heavily increasing gold supplys for a possible switch to a new gold based currency for oil trade if the US trys to sanction them. Yea the French freaked the fuck out when he gave a speech as the head of the African Union urging members to get off their dependence on the IMF and European/US currency and form their own monetary system. It'd be awesome for poor countries so naturally it had to be squashed... France begged he US state department to help out and the rest is history.  This is the least important of all the reasons for the Libyan Intervention. Just read a single memo about the justifications for the war with Libya by the US or EU. You'll be facepalming after realizing you parroted a false talking point peddled by conspiracy theorists who can't bother to actually read source documents instead of website bloggers. At least Saddam was going for another fiat currency. Ghaddafi wanted the lame standard.  You're not actually fixing any misinformation if you don't provide sources. You point to an opinion article written by some phd and somehow that proves there is no petrodollar? Im convinced the fact that oil is priced in dollars drives demand for dollars UP as it is used as the medium for the largest/most important commodity in the world. I'll try to give an example to help my point. Im selling AIR for $100 USD per gallon. I will only accept USD for AIR. You need air to breathe, so what do you do? You need to buy dollars. So just like the stock market, you place a sell order for your currency, and a buy order for USD. If there are more sell orders for your currency than buy orders, your currency is devalued. If oil wasn't priced in dollars, and in euro's instead, what do you think would happen to the dollar/euro ratio? The demand for dollar would go down, and the demand for for euro would go up.  Thank you for correcting me It's so dumb. The idea that Iraq (or for that matter, Libya) would have a massive impact on the US when the US economy and the greater world economy that uses dollars is so much larger.  It was certainly something that Saddam was talking about, and something the US administration was aware of.  It's hard to argue that it was the sole factor or the biggest factor, but it was certainly a factor and would have had some effect on the decision to go in among many other factors. Nobody tell this guy about that time we went to the moon It allows exporting inflation and controls other countries' capability to purchase oil themselves and thus increases effectiveness of economic sanctions. Pro American oil. No Iran, please don't drive us towards energy independence. That'd totally suck to see the middle East undergo economic collapse. No it's not.  Hmmm, commercial/passenger/farm vehicles are the most obvious ones that will ween off first, long before 50 years but that's not the bulk (Almost half though). A lot of beauty/personal products use oil but we already have alternatives to that that don't cost an arm and a leg, it's just a bit more expensive (It will come down through economies of scale obviously). Jet fuel would be the hardest I would think to get off of. Maybe road materials? Heating in some areas of the world?  Plastics are coming along with a lot of alternatives and will be more than there in 50 years (We already have plant based bags and other  plastic-type products). I think the hardest to replace would be performance clothing, even though I doubt that takes a lot of demand. Cotton is terrible for this and wool is great but in certain situations so we are left with polyester and it's derivatives.   Why do you think we will still be largely off oil in 50 years? Can you say that is likely the case in the next 50 years (Not that it won't be stable but that other large economies won't also be stable then)?  This is the smartest post i have read in reddit. I've been alive since Reagan and have never seen such poor communication, foresight, or implementation of a policy since this past week.  It is not normal to have business leaders, former presidents, and many higher ups within the government actively defy the president.  It is not normal for different agencies to have different loyalties.  It is not normal to have this sheer level of confusion as to what is going on. It is not normal for record breaking protests to take place multiple times not even 2 weeks into the presidency.  It is not normal to start verbally trashing one of our largest trading partners (Mexico) and close allies in Europe.  I'm not saying the USD will no longer be the reserve currency, but recent events doesn't exactly making the US look like a pillar of stability.  Maybe people will start trading in SDRs or something. This guy likes his US dollars. >Obama was just as uncertain with his executive orders  This is not true at all. His orders were ran through the AG before being put out, and they were specific. There's nothing like this in the Obama administration.   > The fact that they didn't blink when Assad used chemical weapons and when Russia annexed crimea and then funded ""rebel' groups to invade western Ukraine.  Obama put Russia under crippling sanctions. Trump wants to get rid of them.  > Been wishy washy on trade deals that strengthen our interests, let things expire or put in regulations/department policy that allows foreign competition to have a huge influence on the corporate spectrum.  The TPP would have opened foreign markets in a more secure fashion for US companies. That locks them into USA trade.  > Passed that what the actual fuck of an Iran deal, meanwhile they just conducted their second ballistic missile test since the deal, that was supposed to stop that program  When it comes to nukes, yes delivery is important. But you can't build nukes without the material. That's the key point of the deal. To remove the material.  Meanwhile Trump has said it's fine for other countries to have nuclear weapons, including Saudi Arabia. Yes. Saudi Arabia. Not gonna happen because Israel. But he has no problem with it in principal.  > To say all of a sudden Trump's entirely responsible for less USA influence in the world is a fucking lie  So far Trump has backed out of NATO, the UN, trade deals, pro-leaving the EU, and now immigration. That's his first week. He's also said that the US should only care about US interests, and not those from abroad.  > At least trump as the ""america first"", which is hilarious to me that people said that was somehow bad.  *America first* is not the problem. It's that when Trump puts it across it translates into *America alone*, or *America only caring about America*. That means the rest of the world needs to look beyond America; what can they do without the USA. That's bad for the US.  So your *""Trump has our back and the Democrats were wishy washy""* makes little sense IMO. But the USD isn't the world's reserve currency because of petroleum trading; it's there by virtue of there only being a few currencies with underlying economies big enough to do the job (and not be vulnerable to a Soros-type ""we'll crash the economy to make some money in arbitrage"" attack, like what happened to South Korea.) The only alternatives are the euro, the yen, and the renmibi.  The euro has issues with the internal balances between its economies. Greece has been quiet lately, but that will only last as long as German loan guarantees - and several other euro-zone countries are in not much better shape AND are large enough that bailing them out is impractical. You do not want to have your assets denominated in euro if Spain or Italy runs up on the rocks.  Japan is better off from a fiscal perspective, but has an economy that's in the doldrums with no sign of relief, and a looming demographic problem that will probably result long-term in actual deflation (assuming here that the Japanese don't encourage immigration to make up the numbers, but... that's a safe assumption, don't you think?)  The renmibi's actively manipulated by the Chinese government to promote Chinese exports and reduce imports. That makes it pretty unstable if you're dealing with a trade where neither party is in China.  So that leaves the dollar. Not that the US doesn't have its own issues, but it tends to have them less so than other countries, and has some options to deal with them that simply aren't on the table for the other rich economies. The dollar's not backed by oil, but by steel (the kind that's formed into hundred-thousand-ton aircraft carriers) and by uranium (trust this one's self-explanatory...) Why wouldn't the rich simply engage in capital flight? Lol, people trade in USD because it's stable, not because of some stupid threat of force, ironically using force to make people use the USD would lead to a lot of instability and be self defeating. But keep pretending you understand anything about economics or financial markets.  Are you trying to refute the points I made using a one sentence synopsis of the events? If you actually read the wikipedia article you quoted that from, everything I said is included there.  >As he lost support, he became more autocratic. As early as August 1952, he began to rely on emergency powers to rule, generating controversy among his supporters. After an assassination attempt upon one of his cabinet ministers and himself, he ordered the jailing of dozens of his political opponents. This act created widespread anger among much of the general public, and led to accusations that Mossadegh was becoming a dictator...   >A referendum to dissolve parilment and give the prime minister power to make laws was submitted to voters, and it passed with 99.9% approval... When Mossadegh dissolved the parliment, his opponents decried this act because he had effectively given himself ""total power."" Ironically, this un-democratic act by a democratically elected prime minister would result in a chain of events leading to his downfall  Both from the same wikipedia article.  You weren't even in the right decade, and nuance matters when it comes to understanding history. Mosaddegh was democratically elected, but by the time he was overthrown he was a far cry from the person Iranians thought they were electing. Again, nuance matters. This is not entirely true and misses some key factors. Iraq (early on, pre-saddam), Iran, Syria, and some other countries were not in love with the US. There was a move to Arab nationalism that was threatening US influence in the area, and this was the primary reason the US shifted to back Israel unconditionally in the regional politics (because they acted as a militant proxy to demolish Arab nationalist movements). Meanwhile later on other states such as Iraq and Saudi Arabia were held pretty firmly in the US influence camp due to relationships with the dictators, not love from the populace as a whole. you don't need good relations if you're able to just invade and take the oil America gives a shit about oil. See: our staunch alliance with Saudi Arabia, a country we share no core moral or political values with. You're incredibly ignorant but even worse you're arrogant because you think you know what you're talking about. You have much to learn my friend.  > Middle eastern countries worshiped america until 1973  LOL of course anything can happen, but the dollar not being the best choice is something that I as a financial professional with more experience/certifications than the average person is something I would put a high degree of certainty of it staying the best option.   Just comparing the shocks we know that could happen, and compare their potential effect on their currency vs. the USD. of all the outcomes the USD staying stable is much more likely than any of the others. I'm not saying other players wont take a bigger position on the global stage, that trade deals might be favored with China or asain nations when in the past they would have only had the US to work with. Yes, other currencies will gain strength, but on the fundamental basis of the main global currency the USD isn't going anywhere.  Spain, the country with a 50% unemployment rate?  Forget it, the US and the EU is falling, China will dominate the free world.   So am I. Don't worry tovarish, they'll be gone soon enough.  ""And then it got worse."" -Russian History in one sentence True this - sanctions for both Russia and Iran. Falling oil prices were a much bigger factor. I mean, I guess they'd be liberal as well as literal. Some of them, anyway.  Iran is an Islamic Republic where homosexuality is punishable by death. It is good that the people don't support that, at least according to you, but if you live under Islamic law you are pretty well fucked anyway. There was never a real risk that the US would not continue to pay the debts.  That article explains what would happen, which is true enough, but doesn't really explain how likely it would be to happen, which is not very high.   The price is based on supply and demand and most commonly expressed in Dollars. The currency used only increases or decreases the amount of sellers / buyers available for whatever deal you want to make.    I want Yuan for my oil china will gladly pay me in Yuan but where can I easily spend my Yuan on other things I need/want, pretty much only China. But if I traded for Dollars I could spend those pretty much anywhere because it is the worlds primary reserve currency (something 60% of all reserve currency in the world is dollar).   In short doesn't matter what you base the price on it matters what currency you take in exchange for your oil. They're not ""messing with"" Israel, they're fighting for their right to exist. The Americans ""messed with"" the stronger British Empire for the same right. I used to read the daily papers in Cairo and Abu Dhabi when I was there.  They really weren't raging against Israel as a principal agenda, they were like other newspapers with a mix of stuff from local affairs to cartoons to cookery articles to...  Now admittedly I don't read Arabic, but Egyptian, Jordanian, Lebanese and Emirati friends say there's no real differences between the editions.  I am certain there will be extremist/heavily agendad publications, much as there will be in Israel and even the populist Fox News in USA.  And much as we shouldn't judge all Americans by your extremists, neither should we judge others by theirs. Should of moved to Madagascar. Yes, the end result is the same, I just find the idea that the US attacked Iraq *just* because they wanted to leave the petrodollar reductive. There was much more going on than just US dollar hegemony. In the case of Libya, I doubt anyone in the government thought Gaddafi's plan would ever get off the ground, they just saw the Arab Spring as an opportunity to remove him from power, and took it.  My other annoyance is, Iran has been moving away from the US dollar for over a decade. Yet, every time this comes up in the news, everyone seems to think this is a brand new policy and Iran is just weeks away from invasion. Yup, that tricky truth. Y'know if your mind has been twisted everything will seem like spin. It's not like Russia needs gold, because they're an oil exporter. But China, maybe. http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/110402-France-client-gold-State-Dept.pdf  Wrong can you give me more hint ? i'm interested about that  Wasn't necessarily referring that the same reason is at play here. Except that in all these cases it is always something to do with money that is not in favor for the US. If this is something that really does threaten the USD, then expect Trump to stick his nose in.  France felt threatened by Libyan actions to remove and replace them in a vision for a United Africa, free from western control. Gold-backed dinar is part of that. And this is why the state has to be separated from the monetary system.  Bitcoin FTW! http://foreignpolicy.com/2009/10/07/debunking-the-dumping-the-dollar-conspiracy/  Also: James Hamilton, PhD, Professor of Economics at the University of California, San Diego, stated in a Mar. 2, 2007 e-mail to ProCon.org: ""I am aware of no reputable economist who claims that whether payment for Iraq's oil is conducted in euros rather than dollars would have any significant effect on any variable of interest to the United States. It would not affect the dollar price of oil, it would not affect the U.S. balance of payments, it would not affect U.S. inflation, it would not affect U.S. interest rates, and it would not affect the U.S. money supply. A payment in dollars can perfectly well be made with 'Eurodollars', which refers to dollar-denominated deposits in foreign banks. These could be the assets of someone who does not live in the United States and the liabilities of a financial institution that is in no way affiliated with the United States, whose only connection to the United States would be the units (dollars) in which the account is maintained. Even if the payment were with actual U.S. dollars from a U.S. bank account, this at most introduces a strictly transitory demand for transactions balances whose effects are probably not worth discussing. To suggest that anyone in the current U.S. administration believed otherwise, and indeed was so attached to this nonsensical proposition that they would have advocated that the U.S. go to war on this account, can only be described as fervent attachment to a conspiratorial delusion."" > James Hamilton, PhD, Professor of Economics  His research and field of expertise is specifically in oil economics and has been a renowned economist for over 35 years... And you are exactly? Maybe you should read this sentence one more time: ""To suggest that anyone in the current U.S. administration believed otherwise, and indeed was so attached to this nonsensical proposition that they would have advocated that the U.S. go to war on this account, can only be described as fervent attachment to a conspiratorial delusion."" And this is a ""liberal"" professor during the height of the Iraq War. It's fine because it's extremely common and more people think that then the opposite. Russia propaganda works. I know, OMG... Iraq using the Euro for some trade would be the end of the world... Entire Europe moving to the Euro in entirety... Nothing. I answered that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5r7b1y/iran_to_ditch_dollar_as_anger_builds_over_trump/dd5uyhw/) Possible but hard =/= putting a 20% tariff on Mexico  Actually, no. Trump has said the US should have taken all the oil in Iraq after the invasion. the Sanctions being lifted had very little direct economic benefit with the USA, in regards to long term trade/commodity supple. Yeah they have access to more banking service and get some frozen assets back, but most of the oil will help europe much more than the USA.   To be hoenst iran coming back to the global oil market (they were still getting their supply sold to some extent) didn't have that huge of an effect, and most would end up in europe anyway.   The genie is already out of the bottle, US has far less leverage there, Europe does not want to put sanction back on them any time soon as they are going to be a major provider of oil. Kind of what I go back to when people say to tear up that dog shit of an Iran deal which lets them modernize their ballistic missile program, air force, navy, and become a real disruptor in the middle east that is the furthest thing from on ""our side"". Yeah the saudis, UAE, jordan, egypt, might have some core values that we disagree with, but for the most part they see eye to eye with the west on a macro scale when it comes to stability in the region.  Think places like Yemen is a shit show now, wait until Iran is supporting their Islamist government friends with a couple hundred Su-35's that can compete with saudi and UAE jets. Imagine when they've got modern Russian cruise missiles that can hit any air base in that region from Iran.   For those wondering they just launched their second ballistic missle test in violoation of the nuclear deal, but can claim a grey zone because Kerry let the language be no tests of a nuclear vehicle. So Iran just claims it's for satelites or some bullshit, meanwhile are still spinning centrifuges. But them having a nuke shouldn't be what you're worried about. So maybe right now they could have a crude device, and in 5-10 years be able to get it small enough to deliver a sub megaton load into an ICBM we could probably shoot down. It's a threat don't get me wrong, but I'd be much more worried about them threatening our fleet in the gulf, directly threatening Isreal and other allies with very modern weapons.    US is already mostly north american oil, this is europe and russia's oil. Oil is a finite resource which is always becoming more expensive to extract while the price is not going up as much due to renewables becoming cheaper and more efficient. Nuclear fusion and advanced fission, as well as renewables are the road to sustainable energy independence, not oil regardless of whether its American, Russian or Iranian. Anybody who hopes for economic collapse anywhere is a fool. This just causes problems internationally as well as hurting people in these nations. It's not now more has it ever been about USA having energy independence, that is the least complicated part of this.  It's because the good relations we do have in the Middle East oil business force the entire world to trade oil in US dollars only.    Which makes for an insanely strong dollar in the international trade market.  Oil moving out of US dollars could significantly hurt the value of our money, and put a dent in everyone's retirement funds, 401k, business assets.  It's huge dude.  Energy independence is a Scape goat. > Even if we do that and they swap from the USD our dollar will still crash   Energy independence is good if you are in a state of war, but does not mean much if trade is flowing freely.  Really?  The US gets 40% of its oil from Canada.  You do realize that's still ""dependence on foreign oil"" right? You do know that energy is only a fraction of what oil is used for right? but it is true. Not who you originally asked but there are a few reasons.  First, all of the plastics that you mentioned having plant based alternatives are non-scalable. We might be able to produce plants to make plastics on a small scale but they cannot replace all of what oil supplies given how large the supply needed is. We are talking hundreds of millions of barrels a year. To see what happened last time we tried to make a plant based alternative to oil look at the ethanol debacle when we tried to replace a large amount of gasoline with a corn based alternative.  Second, uses such as shipping, air travel, and heavy trucking have no current technology to replace the use of oil. As economies and populations world wide grow, trade and travel are only expected to increase. Considering the technology for replacing these uses doesn't even exist it is safe to assume that oil will be a large part of their use for quite some time. Then, once we do have the technology, it will be a very, very long time for it to actually get implemented. We are talking hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of dollars of infrastructure that has to be replaced. That takes time.   Third, even with electric vehicles existing we are not close to replacing the use of gasoline in passenger vehicles. Right now electric vehicles make up a tiny portion of total car sales. It will be probably ten years before the majority of cars sold are electric. Then, since the average car stays on the road for 15 years, we will have a considerable amount of time after that where people are still driving gasoline powered vehicles.  Fourth, miscellaneous uses such as asphalt, lubricants, petroleum coke, and others make up over 1.80 million barrels of demand a day in the US alone. That is more than one of those huge tankers you see pictures of. There is nothing out there that we know of (plants included) that can replace even that. All of the demand sources I mentioned above demand far more oil.   Here is a link breaking down oil by end use in the US. Remember, the US is a more advanced economy than most and a large number of countries in the world are expecting demand of all uses to rise.   http://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.cfm?page=oil_use becuase everything I've read says that oil demand will peak in 30-40 years, then provided the techoilogy is there other forms could as you say ween it off. India, large parts of Asia are going through major growth, and Africa has yet to see it as a large part (although you could argue large parts of Africa are way more than 50 years away from seeing something like China growth, to where things other than fossil fuels are more efficient and cost effective).    I think they estimate that by 2060 renewable could provide like 30-40% of energy in the world? So that's not even half 50 years from now. OPEC themselves claim an extra 900,000 barrels a day will be the demand forecast by 2020.  And actually heavy vehicles are one of the hardest areas to convert. Shipping, heavy machinery, airlines as you say. Yes there are interesting projects right now, but they are just that. I guess the rail systems could eventually shift from mostly diesel electric to having electric right on the rails provided by renewable, but it's not feasible in every area right now, and yeah you might see a hydrogen powered combine machine or something, but that's a research project, no where near the stage of being mass produced.  The technology just isn't there yet. I'll be the first to admit I can't predict how fast breakthroughs they happen, only that there are such things as diminishing returns. One day of course fossil fuels won't be the main source of energy for the world. But at least in our lifetime they will still play a major role, might we see the peak and the trend go to the other direction sure, but even that will be much later in my opinion.  It's 'wean' not 'ween.'  Holy shit you guys actually seemed pretty smart for a minute... The problems facing the Eurozone and China are more real than liberal tears.  The President doesn't control the budget strings, he can't spend the U.S. into an even deeper pit.   The President doesn't control the reserve bank, so he can't just buy bonds, or stop paying interest.   He doesn't do all the dealing on trade deals (that's the senate), he can't just do what he wants.  For all the uncertainty, rhetoric, and bullshit the U.S.A still has an enormous separation of powers that hamstrings the executive. Americans need to learn their own constitution. Then realise their whole government structure is setup so fuckall happens. Tyranny of the majority and all that.   In the end of it all, the USA is still the most stable country, and therefore USD is still a hell of a lot more stable currency than the reminbi (currently not even 1% of global reserves is in the RMB...), and the EU could fall apart at any moment, meaning the Euro stops existing. No body's going to reserve into a currency that might stop existing over night. Hey Teresa.   Wanna catch a movie? what? every executive order trump has done has gone through the justice department legal channels, they actually showed evidence of it, it's why they fired the acting AG, which even far left legal experts agreed was the right move.   My comment was in regards to market stability/creating volatility. When obama would pass one or throw some department rule in overnight, some of those completely destabilized markets overnight. the DOL ruling, the for profit education thing, no longer using private prisons at the federal level, etc. Those had shocking effects on various sectors of the market, the DOJ stopping billion dollar mergers, SEC taking huge action against banks and what not.   Again, don't take my comments in this post to be political, just that all presidents have done things with very short notice that shake things up if you will. Weather you agree with the things obama did or not, or the thigns trump, bush, clinton, bush Sr. Carter, reagan, etc. I'm just saying that we've always had things like executive order, department ruling, unexpected court rulings, yet at the core our currency is still as stable as ever. Markets will go up and down sure, the value of the currency relative to others might have major volatility, but there's really never been a threat (except for a short time in the late 60's) to it's availability and clarity of it's true value.  > So far Trump has backed out of NATO, the UN,  [Uhhh](http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/nato_countries.htm), no he [hasn't](http://www.un.org/en/member-states/). He's mentioned he might be interested in restructuring our involvement/financial responsibility in them but he hasn't done anything remotely official yet, and most certainly has not backed out. [removed] [removed] Why is Iran threatening to ditch the dollar if it's better for them and won't hurt the US at all? Huh, and why is the American dollar stable you might ask?  Well because it is the only oil currency used internationally and that status is protected by force.   What do you think happens to that little perk if the world goes off oil? > and nuance matters   There's no nuance. The United States and Britain security establishments acted to remove the democratically elected leader of a foreign nation after said nation nationalized the oil fields and replaced said democratically elected leader with a tyrant.    If they'd replaced said leader with a more democratic figure your argument would have some merit.    Your argument is vacuous, your claim of the high ground is foolish. You are absolutely a troll with a brand spanking new account trying to stir shit up.   To you Troll, I say good day. It's possible to work with two entities that hate each other. The US partners with Israel because of the power and influence of the J Street lobby, and her appetite for weapons. The US loves Saudi Arabia for it's oil and appetite for our weapons. But we didn't invade to take the oil? We have never taken their oil by force. what's the point of serving israel if we cared so much? How familiar are you with the first half of the 20th century mideast? Sorry to say but if China and OPEC decide to dump the dollar, it's done as the world's primary reserve currency. Past results and events do not indicate future performance in finance. You should know  >Just comparing the shocks we know that could happen, and compare their potential effect on their currency vs. the USD. of all the outcomes the USD staying stable is much more likely than any of the others.   What do you think of a new currency? An international one with an absolute money base, like bitcoin would be 150 years from now on?  Say, China, Russia and Iran trying to do that, and lets say their trades among each other is like the following:  Russia exports:$10B Iran, $55B China  China exports:$25B Iran, $45B Russia  Iran exports:$20B Russia, $15B China  This is of course just theoretical. Such a balance cannot be achieved so easily and the more countries that are taken into account, the better of a balance can be achieved.  But under that scenario, let's say they created a bitcoin-like digital currency named UEE, and created accounts for each country and the following amounts of UEE has been transferred into their accounts:  Russia: UEE 65.000.000.000  China: UEE 70.000.000.000  Iran: UEE 35.000.000.000  or any number of them that are proportional to the ratios of 65, 70 and 35. And then ban the use of any other currency for international trade among these 3 countries other than UEE.  What would happen then? Nothing. The trade would just keep going on just fine among themselves and they would respectively have extra $65B, $70B and $35B free currency to spare/dump. You seem to be very certain about what the future will bring.   I suspect you'll be surprised.  You are just are troll. A sad, useless troll.  I don't care.   here is Bourdain in Iran. https://archive.org/details/AnthonyBourdainPartsUnknownIran  People are people. A person in Iran, unlike you, does not hate you. >The U.S. didnt default on its debt in 2011. Republicans and Democrats reached a last-minute deal to raise the borrowing limit. Even so, the posturing hurt consumer confidence and wiped out $6 trillion of value from global stocks.  Here, read the wiki article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_debt-ceiling_crisis_of_2013#Debt_ceiling_reached_again  US would have defaulted on October 17 -- Congress approved the debt ceiling increase on October 16.  We were 24 hours away from defaulting.    I've never been 24 hours away from getting evicted, have you? I would call that too close to happening! Uh no palestine isn't fighting to survive. They have terror groups within CONSTANTLY attacking Israel.  Israel has been the country fighting to survive since day 1. Go read history. Stabbing, ramming innocent civilians is fighting now? lol. It's either should **HAVE** or should**'VE**, but never should **OF**.    See [Grammar Errors](http://www.grammarerrors.com/grammar/could-of-would-of-should-of/) for more information. !RemindMe 2 Hours >a vision for a United Africa, free from western control  Most nations in Africa did not share his vision. This is like Saddam wanting to rebuild Nineveh: insignificant in the wider context. You're right in the sense that France is the one that lead the charge but the monetary currency nonsense is just the leftovers from the whole Ron Paul/gold-standard/petrodollar/Zeitgeist Movie crap. The actual consequence of such a change is horribly exaggerated. And it's been peddled harder by RussiaToday and Russian State Media than anyone. I'm not saying it wasn't a factor, but that it was one of the most insignificant. Read the memos, you'll understand. Cool, thanks. do you mind explaining what you believe the reasons for invasion of Libya / Iraq were? When GWB was elected, he asked his people to find a way to goto war with iraq before 9/11. 9/11 was done by bush and cronies as justification to goto war and pass shit like the patriot act. Im not disputing you on the fact that saddam switching to euro as the reason to goto war.. but what i do disagree with is this notion you and your phd friend have on how the usd being the defacto currency  for oil for a long time has not increased demand for us dollars. Come on, you know it. Invading Iraq was dumb. Demolishing the secular government was dumber. Having no idea of what victory looked like was dumber yet. The only real plan for Iraq would have been invasion, occupation, and effective colonization until an organic secular government could live on its own. That means generations, because cultures don't change overnight. So yeah, take their oil, and everything else, or leave it alone.  Anyone pretending otherwise is fooling themselves. Just because be said than about Iraqi oils doesn't mean he's no pro American oil aka energy independence. He means there was an opportunity to get Iraqi oil, so why not.   So your 'actually no' is totally false  While Iranian interests are certainly counter American ones with regard to the Middle East, Iran being a target of the travel ban puts the lie to the notion that it's about national security. No one linked to the Iranian government or Hezbollah has ever even made intimations about wanting to strike within the continental US. Hezbollah as an organization is extremely focused on fighting Israel and defending what they consider to be Arab territory, there's no reason to believe they have an interest in attacking targets in the distant abroad. Considering the shit British and Americans have done to Iran over the years... I say let them. Not that Khomeini's governments were than much more 'clean' in their acts later.  Without the brits and American medling in Iran we wouldn't even have Islamistic Iran. Honestly though, they are more stable and less inclined to supporting Islamic terror than Pakistan.   Also Iranian oil has had little impact because they are pumping out around 3.5 mbpd. They can ramp this up to 5 mbpd without investments. With greenfield investments of $ 150 bn (China and India alone are willing to cough this up) they can push it up to 8mbpd. Iran is yet to flood the market...overtime they will.  Well, but let's be honest here War runs on oil, and petrochemical products.  If you don't have a glut of oil, you aren't a world threat.  Europe doesn't have much oil, so it can't mount large combined arms invasions. It would need to fight a defensive war.  So instead Europe labors to build all the inventions the future will be made out of, centralizes the tech companies, and builds a surveillance state to keep the migrants out.  It can't go full asshole, because that takes oil. We're not even remotely close enough to nuclear fusion to affect oil prices.  Nope.  Maybe liberal tears will become the new world reserve currency. Ok, he's only called NATO obsolete and similar for the last 12 months. I think you're overly sanguine about Chinese prospects in a war with the US (pipelines don't dodge and tankers aren't much more nimble), but you're correct that there's nothing keeping people from using the dollar other than their own self-interest, and to the extent that the renmibi becomes a more attractive currency, people may migrate to that instead. What's the case today may not be the case twenty years from now.  You're also correct that the US has a lot of advantages as a major food exporter.  I do think you're off base on pointing to elite preferences as a reason behind the dollar's primacy. Remember that the individual transactions are largely not generated by governments, but by firms. (Also, not to put too fine a point on it, if it's inevitable that these things migrate to the largest trading country with the soundest economy, then you don't have to further posit that it's the result of some kind of US policy that's driving things to the dollar now...) Why are Democrats threatening to resist Trump when they don't have any power?  It's about optics and making your stance known.  Iran ""ditching"" the dollar would hardly affect America at all, but it may be an effective PR move.   The biggest threat to the ""petro dollar"" is Trump, not any country in the ME. The less stable our currency is, the less it's trusted.  That simply isn't the case, I mean look at an oil history price chart and compare it to the value of the USD and you'll see there isn't a correlation as there should be if the USD is solely stable because it's used for trading oil.  Well if we're going on actual feelings instead of general diplomatic relations, nobody in the middle east loved the US. They're a base in the middle East for us. They're like US 2.0 over there. It's easier to gather intelligence on adversary countries when youre hundreds of miles away as opposed to thousands  Yeah, the Iranians sure loved America and Britain when they disposed the democratically elected PM in 1952 and put the Shah back in powpower in 1953 after Iran nationalized their oil production...   The Middle East has never had anything but contempt for the West after it became obvious that the West dissolved Ottoman power after WWI only to exploit the Middle East themselves.  and I've given plenty of valid, well documented reasons as to why China and Opec wouldn't dump the dollar as their reserve currencies. TBH, very little was done with the dollar in Iran before all of this anyway, as it was hard to get US dollars in the country due to sanctions.   I'm also not giving a prediciton of future Forex rates or performance of a currency, just a very confident thesis that the US's will still be the main one used by the world, hands down no question. That doesn't mean other countries won't have more economic influence, and that their currencies wont become more widely used in time (mainly the Asian currencies).   The closest there ever was to a change was the Special drawing rights that the IMF did due to a shortage of foreign reserve assets, mainly US dollars  and gold/silver back in the 60's.   100 years down the road who knows, but as I said, not in our lifetime. And especially not in the near future. While this, in theory sounds good, you still have a similar issue with the euro and some of their members not being able to issue their own currency and control the money supply. Unless you mean it's on top of their own currency, they kind of do have that in [Special drawing rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_drawing_rights), issues by the IMF when there was a shortage of reserve currencies in the late 60's.   I guess if they all agreed and had equal representation on some central governing body that issued the stuff, but Europe can barley agree on things, good luck getting russia china and Iran, who's views are all still very different.    Mexico is in talks with China in a trade deal, if you think calling me a troll is going to change things, well, good luck with that.  China, Canada and Mexico creating their own NAFTA could change things around. Sure there are good people and bad people everywhere. If Islam was just a religion things would be a lot different, but the rule of law is based on this madness. I like this bot You're right that the focus shouldn't be on the details, but rather the bigger picture. These countries that declare war under false pretenses are evil and we should be ashamed for not protesting.   The threat of collapsing the dollar, however, is very real. If OPEC decided today that all oil will from now on be traded in Euros, then countries would dump dollars for Euros tomorrow on a massive scale. Inflation would run rampant. The extent of these effects is the only unknown. > The only real plan for Iraq would have been invasion, occupation, and effective colonization until an organic secular government could live on its own. That means generations, because cultures don't change overnight. So yeah, take their oil, and everything else, or leave it alone.  Except Trump never said that. He seemed to be advocated just literally taking their oil and handing it over to U.S. companies like Exxon as ""payment"" for the U.S. invasion. Just because  you're occupying the nation doesn't mean you need to take all of it's resources. Did we take Germany's minerals and ore? Did we take Japan's....rice? Idk how Japan seriously managed to do so well historically, they ain't got shit in terms of natural resources. It's actually pretty impressive.  > he only real plan for Iraq would have been invasion, occupation, and effective colonization until an organic secular government could live on its own. That means generations   Iraq had an organic secular government before the invasion though. where did I say they are a threat to the united states? We could take out their entire air force and navy with the f-18's we have in the gulf. Fuck we could launch sorties from the safety of the united states and in a day or two have it all wiped out. I even mentioned that their ballistic missile technology shouldn't worry us that much. Yet it has a chance to cause even more major destabilization in the region.       >>Islamistic Iran.  come again?  > Europe doesn't have much oil, so it can't mount large combined arms invasions. It would need to fight a defensive war.  I see no problem with this. Nukes and defensive military tech will keep most major military powers out of Europe. Then its just about managing terrorism and Russian hybrid warfare.  Also Europe will have much more oil resources available for military purposes if it focuses on renewable/nuclear energy for the civilian sector. Replacing gasoline and diesel cars, trucks and buses with electric vehicles will go a long way toward freeing up oil resources for the military. How about both y'all give us reasons as to why?   I disagree because Kuwait, Qatar, UAE, Indonesia, Algeria, Nigeria, Ecuador, Angola, and Gabon are all OPEC members, and do matter (Also venezuela).  Edit for idiocracy Not scarce enough. Maybe I should replace loves with tolerates. However, I do believe Israel loves the US government. Without it, they have few supporters. lol people say that but the 5th fleet is stationed in bahrain. There is no US base in Israel. There are bases in kuwait and turkey. Not only do a lot of middle eastern countries share intel with the US but they host US prisoners. There is literally no use for israel. Its pure policy stupidity, politicians can't displease their AIPAC overlords. Correct. The Sykes Picot agreement gave Lebanon and Syria and north iraq to France and south iraq and Israel and Jordan to Britain. This agreement was established well before the war ended. This was right around when Zionism became a mainstream topic in foreign affairs as well. Then of course Britain helped Ibn Saud conquer the Persian gulf peninsula and name it after himself  >I guess if they all agreed and had equal representation on some central governing body that issued the stuff, but Europe can barley agree on things, good luck getting russia china and Iran, who's views are all still very different.  The reason EURO is a bit problematic is because it is their official currency also.  I got the impression from your post that you actually didn't read mine, or else you wouldn't have used ""lack of printing capability"" as an argument against this theoretical currency UEE, after all currently USD is what is used for international trade and other countries cannot issue USD too. In exactly what way do you see things changing, should it ever actually come to life and have the scope you claim?  We still inject people with poison and let them suffer for 90 minutes before the die as capital punishment. So may not be as bad a punishing gays by death but we are no shining beacon of human rights    Christians claim the same here. >  He seemed to be advocated   He ""seemed to be"" talking about sexual assault, according to a bunch of maiden aunts  on the internet, too. > Idk how Japan seriously managed to do so well historically, they ain't got shit in terms of natural resources. It's actually pretty impressive.  You only need to spend a little time there to realise what they do  Answer? Work bloody hard, and I mean hard, silly hours, and do so in an incredibly structured, focused, and disciplined society.  History Lesson time  Japan did so well because Japan had 2 things on its side.  In 1868 when they began modernizing. They had a largely literate population this makes modernization quicker.   In Post WWII Japan had the Korean War, then the Vietnam war, both of which the US dropped money in Japan to get things produced there and sent to their troops. Japan did so well because of the close ties with the USA because money was spent on infrastructure and with some currency pegging. When you look at the path of China right now, it's very very similar than Japan except on an accelerated path. It'll be interesting to see if China is able to avoid the pitfalls of Japan as they also have robotics, and a demographic change hitting at the same time as their rise.  > Germany's minerals and ore? Did we take Japan's  We could've easily. The soviet union pretty much did just that in their part of germany.  No, it had a dictatorship maintained by a secret police. Right, but none of that has anything to do with preventing Iranian nationals from entering the United States. I was commenting on the ""threat"" of Iran and Hezbollah as it relates to the travel ban. Shows how you don't know shit about Iran and the revolution at the '70s that put Khomeini in power.  Both Mossadegh until his death in the hands of the British machinated coup d'etat and the Shah they propped up (again)were about as religiously fanatic as Donald Trump. the Ajatollahs came to power as a backlash to what the ""old faith""-circles in Iran thought as overly secular & corrupt governments that threatened Islamic values.   >Qwatar      lol Don't worry, the market has a built in correction device called  ""attention span"". Wait a few more weeks and the average American will be back to taking selfies and binge watching Netflix. I hear the Superbowl's coming up. What are you doing for Valentine's? Have you tried that new Mexican place on 45th? > Israel   didn't exist. It was palestine.  should have been more clear my bad, yeah it would work fine for international trade, mine was more that I just don't see it getting off the ground really. I didn't see that you meant to add it on top of their own personal currency, and it holds some value relative to their own currency, while still giving them the ability to print for their own domestic needs.  I think for this to work though you would need a lot more nations to equal it out. As it would be to easy with those three for one of them to manipulate it to their benefit by minipulating their own currency. One of the reasons USD works so well to is that there's just so much of it. It would almost be impossible for us to make major shifts in it by just printing more or through various monetary policy. Iran on the other hand....   It's an interesting idea and one that we might definitely gravitate to in the next 50, 100 years as economies become more and more interconnected.  In short, Mexico is an export economy. They make things and then sell things.   China does as well, and with a billion people, Mexico can sell to more people, completely bypassing the USA as the consumer/import economy.(320 million people). China can then sell their products as well, creating a symbiotic relationship that benefits both countries (buy and sell). China has had success with African counties, they can do they same with Mexico.  Of course, there will be a logistics issue, but China has a one party system which it can use to execute policies quickly.   Also, the political climate is stable. You know what you are getting with China. No system of government is perfect but Islamic law is beyond the pale and fundamentally incompatible with Western values. Iran was more like Turkey until us and the brits made chaos, really sucks.

"15",14,"5r740r","2017-01-31","Airport securities can be real assholes Is that a penis pump? Prove to us your erectile dysfunction! Not sure what should bother me more: the thought of my wife being forced to milk herself in front of strangers or the thought that the check if a breast-pump is hiding a bomb is to verify if the woman is lactating. Wtf is this shit? Why can't they just examine the pump and be done with it. As long as the pump is a pump, let her go. Whether or not she is lactating should not even be a bone of contention. Giving perverts the right to infringe on peoples privacy to orcastrate a securiry theater that is hillariouslx bad at catching actual threats is a truly remarkable result of ""the war on terror"" >""What if it were a man transporting the device? He would not be able to show he's lactating.""  I will challenge that remark. My ex would have whipped it out, squirted the woman in the eye, and laughed about it. While traveling, I obviously always have my penis pump in my backpack, Ill visit frankfurt airport next week. What is this world coming to??? Airport staff really need better training with regards to medical equipment. They have no right to put people through this degrading and humiliating crap. I've heard so many stories about people with colostomies, breast pumps, insulin pumps and so on being abused by airport staff because their shitty attempts at keeping people safe is more important than people's dignity. Why can't anyone ever ask me to prove what my personal lubricant is for...? I guess they don't fuck around with that 3oz fluid limit ""We need proof. I need to see milk coming out of your nipples, and I also need to see if you have a vagina. Also your anus to check that you really are a human and not a robot."" the lactating seems weird, they didn't actually need to know if she was or wasn't, if they suspected the pump was a bomb they could of disassembled it to check. How is it a matter of security to know if a woman is lactating or not? Must be just a coincidence that the woman is not white. Tits or GTFO policy. I live in germany and from my perspective on german law there can be legal consequences if the mother chooses so I fly this particular route quite regularly. JFK-Frankfurt-Singapore. On Singapore Airlines. We don't even change planes, but we do deplane. It's always struck me how different the experience is going to and from the United States. I'm also a brown dude with a pretty thick beard. I've done this round trip once a year since 2007 and the security procedures haven't changed that much over time.   On my way to Singapore, we deplane at Frankfurt directly into the boarding gate area and basically just hang out until the flight is boarded once again. A few security folks walk around asking individuals to do private pat downs. Over the years I've been asked to a pat down once that I remember. It was uncomfortable, but that's to be expected.   Now, the way back to the US is a COMPLETELY different monster. We deplane in Frankfurt and are required to go through security again and it can be far more intense. I've been fortunate enough to avoid a bad situation but my dad was strip searched there years ago.   I always thought it had to be imposed by the US.  I went through Frankfurt airport to get back to California earlier this month, my bag and others were flagged as positive for explosives.   I know for sure I had not been near any explosives, I think their machines are just broken or they like excuses to search people.  As other have said they really crossed the line in this case. There was no need at all to ask the woman to do this, other than for the fun of it - disgusting behavior by the airport staff. >""We deny the allegation that the passenger was asked to prove her ability to breastfeed.""  I have the feeling someone isn't entirely honest. Either the woman, the police or both. I feel like this is one of the few situations where you would be 100% justified in squirting that jerk in the face. If they suspected the machine, they should have checked the machine. Whoever did this is a fucking idiot and got obsessed with a potential lie instead of airport security. What if a man was carrying the pump to deliver it to his wife?  My wife was made to chug some baby formula in front of security to prove it wasn't poison or some shit. ""Ma'am, we're gonna have to confiscate those breasts"" I hope she sues them to oblivion.  Edit :   > Gayathiri Bose told the BBC she was ""humiliated"" by the experience and would explore formal legal action.  Good going.  Typical Frankfurt airport most of us Germans living in Frankfurt hate saying we do to avoid being associated with the shitty airport, and after traveling through so many airports a cross the world it really shows just how bad Frankfurt airport is with the annoying body scanners and horrible layed out design  [Was this the arresting officer?](https://gasface.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/breast-milk.jpg?w=479&h=359) so umm how about tenga? is that okay? The security officer was a pervert with poor concept of reasonableness. Too bad it wasn't recorded and they are merely accusations and will be treated as such in court.  Typing 'spectra breast pump' into Google image search would also have helped verify the function of the device. Tits or get the fuck out is a widely respected principle. So slap him in the face with your tits and when the milk shoots out say is that good enough asshat>? I can't understand why these situations led to a he said-she said scenario. If airport authorities want to check further, they can clearly  document their investigation and ask the passenger to sign it. If there is an issue, it gets escalated until both parties agree to on what happened.  I see nothing positive to come out of this. Mother has to prove lactation but refugees don't even have to prove they are legitimate refugees... I mean, big fucking deal.  Thank God it was a woman who asked her though or could you imagine... ""She was told to squeeze her breast."" To me the case is simple, the prosecutors should ask this simple question: Where they aroused? If the answer is no, then no charges should filed. Good so this terrorists scums wont be bombing innocent life Legal migrants like this one get treated like animals in germany while millions of undocumented migrants get ""refugees welcome""  germany is one retarded country That's true, but they usually also probe them.  You are what you...eat? i think they have gone too far this time! That's why I take the ICE services, cheaper and actually the seat is even better, feels more comfortable, no fee for baggage and no body search before boarding the train. Fuck the airport security these elementary school drop outs.  >Is that a penis pump  That's totally not my bag baby! They must not know about my fear boner... If the problem is just erectile dysfunction viagra and related drugs solve the vast majority of cases.  Penis pumps are more used for the fetish of making your penis YUGE. =) You're gonna hear some weird pumping sounds and groaning in the mans bathroom. If you want to check the breast pump, X-ray it. Every airport security checkpoint has an X-ray scanner. There's absolutely no valid reason for asking a woman to milk herself to prove the breast pump works.  Sounds to me like they need to be sued and publicly called perverts to mend their ways. One thing is for sure: if some woman asks my wife to squeeze her breasts, I'd better be in that room with them, or there had better at least be an HD quality video shot from several angles that I can study at some time in the future...for science, of course.   The only crime here is that, they didn't taste the breastmilk, what if it was milky cocaine? Exactly.  I am a man but I use a breast pump for sexual purposes, I could not prove lactation at an airport if needed and would be denied bringing my breast pump to the convention. The police said that's what they did. Your choice whom to believe. You and Robert DeNiro I will ask a female security officer to milk me. Right? When I was lactating I had a good 6+ foot reach. I coulda got the bitch from across the room.  You ex sounds like me They have this fat, hairy policeman who'll check until you give some milk. Articles about women lactating, for me at least. ""Madam, squirt on the table, please!"" It's either could **HAVE** or could**'VE**, but never could **OF**.    See [Grammar Errors](http://www.grammarerrors.com/grammar/could-of-would-of-should-of/) for more information. Maybe they thought she was carrying more than 4oz per breast?  ^^^Sorry, ^^^couldnt ^^^help ^^^myself.    In a serious note... I hope she gets a great payday out of this and some people at the airport end up without jobs.  Absolutely sickening.  Whilst this sucks for the victim, there's no clear indication that race is a factor... I do not deny that it's possible that race is a factor, however...  #you are the only one bringing race into this.  What they did to the woman was wrong and deplorable but as a brown skinned person I've found most European airports to be a lot better. Of course , there's always 'random' checking of my/SO's luggage but they're at least respectful. TSA makes you feel like criminals.          I thought my opinion of the Frankfurt airport was unfounded since I only flew out of it once but if the locals feel that way too maybe it isn't so unfair. Yeah they took away my zippo because it actually produced flame. If it was empty they would have let it go. The whole point of a lighter is to produce a flame! Even though I have flown with it dozens of times, Frankfurt wouldn't let me. Fuck the Frankfurt airport. I'm from the south so I bash you guys all the time, but I fiind the airport quite good. I've arrived at much as 45 minutes before my flight & never got late; for a huge airport, that's quite an achievement.   They just have to get rid of those stupid body scanners in Terminal 1 Security check? Sure, but what has lactation got to do with any of it? If you want to examine the pump, go right ahead and put it through an x-ray machine. Items are either allowed or not allowed, the ability of their owners to operate the devices are totally irrelevant. If they aren't allowed, confiscate them.  I mean, what's next? Asking a man to masturbate because he has a sexy magazine in his suitcase? Oh what, he's impotent so the magazine must be a component of his ""peace package"" that he's gonna assemble on the plane? Don't make us laugh our asses off. We need some common sense here, and the airport security is not demonstrating any. As the officials have admitted, asking a woman to squeeze her breast and lactate is not part of any standard procedures. Are you deliberately missing the blatant violation of privacy to make some kind of point, are you trolling, or are you legitimately that thick? Would you be cool with security taking your dick out and examining it? I don't see why arousal is an issue here.  power is the more likely culprit. straight from the 'if the balls dont touch, its not gay' department. >Good so this terrorists scums wont be bombing innocent life   Dat post history, tho. She's an Indian Hindu!  When have you ever seen Hindu's bombing innocents? Wtf are you talking about? This time? What's ICE service? There is a credit card receipt for swedish made penis enlarger pump signed by OB1_kenobi as well, sir One manual for penis pump written by OB1_Kenobi titled ""this is totally my bag!"" Nah With picture of OB1_Kenobi lol aren't penis pumps unpleasant  ""You guys just handed me a lucrative lawsuit on a silver platter. Thanks!"" Perhaps thats the officer's fetish? Sounds like something the sex offender registry would be good for. The article says they did x-ray it. She was questioned and asked to show and squeeze her breast after the pump had already been x-rayed.   X-raying babies milk can irradiate it, no?  this airport does not have the capability to do that, that was why this happened.   frankfurt is not in the US.  I guess Germany isn't part of the World. Hannibal Burris reference?   Out of curiosity, do you use it on yourself? Wait what?  Not trying to denigrate you, but I had no idea people, or men, did this.  Learn something new everyday! As if a same-gender officer was incapable of perversion... Lol you can keep repeating this all you want to man, everyone agrees it is perverse regardless of officer gender. You're the one I incapable of understanding that perversion can be same sex. >It was a female officer that asked her to prove it...if you had bothered to read the article. Let me guess, because it's not a man now, they aren't perverts? Here come the feminist downvotes...   Reading comprehension isn't your forte, huh? Women are capable of perversion you know... [removed] He is the first person I think of when I hear talk of lactating. I have nipples. Can you milk me? It would end up being a male. Video or it didn't happen Reunited and it feels so good. You're the left one, she's the right. I'm looking forward to it. ""Let me just bring out this glass panel...theeere we go"" I ate as much as I could of that delicious pie. I could of sworn he was right.  The woman is not white. People of color are most often the victims of this kind of discrimination. And just because you or the article haven't mentioned race doesn't mean that it may not be a factor.  Yes I did bring up race or rather color and am not sorry about that. Consciously or unconsciously color is a factor when at an airport. I would love to say that this is wrong, and I'm just being paranoid but I think a person who is similar to me in all aspects but white would not have had as many additional checks and pat downs as me. That IS a fact. I'll take back my statement and apologize the day that I see this change with my own eyes.    It doesn't matter that India too has suffered from terrorist attacks or that Indians had nothing to do with that asshole bin Laden, somehow not being white is reason enough to pull up your cabin luggage for additional checks or pat you down some more. > TSA makes you feel like criminals.  Which you obviously are because you are brown skinned. I read that in Trump's Mein Drumpf.^^/s Middle eastern airports are better though and their airlines are far far better than european with younger staff and aeroplane fleet Haha it's a very common thing from most people in Hessen to hate the airport, it's really bad especially terminal 1 flew once out of frankfurt when I was like 5. had a snorkel in my luggage and they honestly insisted that I empty my whole bag because they thought it was a gun. a 5 year old, with a gun, pre 9/11. It gets even worse if you bring lots of camera gear like I do for work, they want to check inside every body and lens and almost filled one of my canon 1dx cameras with a power dust.  London, Oslo, Stockholm, Paris no other airports have ever come close to how bad it is here Yeah those are the worst, makes me hate flying with camera gear or anything valuable as it is so easy for someone to just steal it during the hour that it feels like the body scanner takes Don't you know? At the airport you have no privacy >I don't see why arousal is an issue here.  >power is the more likely culprit.   I think the previous Redditor's comment was sardonic to criticize rape culture. Never seen, but the Tamil Tiger, sure have. Well her ancestors were migrants to Singapore. So I guess.....I don;t know what I'm saying.  German InterCity Express trains.  Funny story, my wife and I almost got kicked off an ICE train on the way to Paris because I didn't have a DB Bahn card or whatever, even though I had a printed first class ticket. Almost got left even though I paid 400 euros for tickets.  High-Speed train services called Intercity-Express of the Deutsche Bahn in Germany. Hell no, they're the best but, they cost 2000 dollars. Not that lucrative in Germany though /r/lactation  Oh baby Nope, foods don't get radioactive if you shoot X-rays through them. Every bag of chips you buy, every box of cereal, pretty much any packaged goods have been X-rayed at the factory to make sure no bits of metal off the production line got into your food.  There was no baby involved anyway. The baby was home, thousands of miles away. She carried the breast pump because she was lactating and breasts can get painful if there's no baby to suckle. Common misconception   Source: rad scientist   *I like radiation, AMA   >>X-raying babies milk can irradiate it, no?   She was not carrying baby milk.  Too much fallout. No, it can decrease it's nutritional value however. Source: I am physics student.  > X-raying babies milk can irradiate it, no?  [By definition, it will](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/irradiate), but that does not mean that the milk itself will become radioactive, which I think is what you fear.  You pretty much [need neutron radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_radiation#Health_hazards_and_protection) to do that. WTF with the downvotes? It was a reasonable request for clarification! Wow, you mean Europe offers no legal redress? I thought they were big on human rights and the dignity of the individual. Even have a European court for such matters. I don't know why you're getting downvoted. the US is crazy sue happy >Gayathiri Bose told the BBC she was ""humiliated"" by the experience and *would explore formal legal action.*  Literally the first line in the body of the article. [removed] So you claim it cannot be a pervert because it was a woman, than get offended the statement that you and no one else here made? No, man. I read the article in detail and I knew it was a woman. Don't tell me how I'd change my mind once I realized it was a woman. I'm not changing my mind. I consider *all* people - men or women - to be perverts if they demand that a women must milk herself at the airport to prove she's not a terrorist. Doesn't matter if it's a man or a woman!  It's a pervert umm most airports even outside the US have baggage scanners that could easily xray that shit.   hell they even mention that they xray outerwear and hand luggage on the airport website.  What do you think the machine you put your baggage through is? Do you think every airport outside the US is made out of wood and has wild animals running around?  Frankfurt is the biggest financial centre in Europe, and is an Alpha world city. I think its ignorant to think that the airports in the United States are automatically better equipped than anywhere else.   As a side note I was in Frankfurt the other day, they have baggage scanners, like every other airport. Doesn't take much to scan that.  Of course not, that's what I pay the dwarf for. Oh please denigrate me, that's the best part of the process.  Side note though, I was joking around.  There's a skit Louis CK does about bringing lube on a plane and they can't confiscate it because he uses it to masturbate. ""Airport security guard commits suicide after being instructed to make man lactate"" he does have voluptous lips .... Yea, only the case when it ends a sentence or follows with a verb. This bot could of done better. It's either could **HAVE** or could**'VE**, but never could **OF**.    See [Grammar Errors](http://www.grammarerrors.com/grammar/could-of-would-of-should-of/) for more information. Racism absolutely is an issue, and I will agree that people of colour are absolutely more likely to suffer because of it.  However, when we don't know the races of the perpetrators, and no race motive has been mentioned... I just feel like throwing ""racism"" at everything where racism *might* be an issue, is the wrong way to go about fixing the core problems.  I don't agree with calling people racist, based on the victims race alone. Racism is an issue, yes.   You most likely *have* been subjected to more hardships based on your race, yes.  however, calling people ""racists"" based only on the victims race, is the wrong way to go about fixing racism as whole.  You're using race as a victim card, and not considering that you are hypocritically being biased against a group of people. That is true. I use Emirates even though Lufthansa offers direct flights.  Best to show up wearing hospital gowns and then put on clothes after security check. Sounds like it's your fantasy, not his. If it is, I apologize... it didn't convey well to me. How the hell can you take trains if you're flying from I've continent to another? Holy shit man, what the fuck!  common enough for people to insist that it not be done to their milk unfortunately; and to throw tantrums if they're not met with having their demands ceeded That's rad You can go to court, but there is no legal mechanism to claim punitive or emotional compensatory damages for such cases in most (all?) european countries, so there is not much to gain (financially) even if you win. You could perhaps get them to stop the practice, though, if the law is on your side. It would be quicker to get the attention of politicians, and have them put a stop to this nonsense.  They probably do, but the culture doesn't truly support it.  The US is ""sue-happy"" and that's part of the problem, not the solution. Except that article doesn't talk about other countries at all. For all we know the United States could be 10x more litigious than other countries. That being said I agree with the premise of the article that companies are more afraid of lawsuits than people that actually sue.\  Edit: If you look at this article http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/olin_center/papers/pdf/Ramseyer_681.pdf you will see that while the US has more litigations per 100k people it's not absurdly higher than the UK (although a good 3-4x higher than many other countries in the study). you assume all scanners are equal? did you check which model they have or just assume?  there is a reason why it is called a security ""theater"" its to give the illusion of high security.  > Do you think every airport outside the US is made out of wood and has wild animals running around?  nope, but i lived there for years and have been to that airport more times than i can count in the last decade. they often had to disassemble metal and plastic items because their scanners are not that great.  you assume all scanners are equal? did you check which model they have or just assume? Hold my pump, I am going in! testing this bot: could officials offer colds? I could, of course. I could of never seen this coming The race of the perpetrators actually doesn't matter, and neither does their conscious motives.  The system *itself* is racist, and it operates the same no matter who is enforcing its rules. I had written and then deleted a paragraph from my previous reply. It went on to say I've lived in and traveled to many places and can think of only three to four instances of personal experiences of racism in the course of almost a decade. So I still believe in the goodness of people. And you are right, it would be hypocritical to call others racists without any basis.   But in an airport I'm judged by my color. It is what it is. You can take a train from Europe to Asia. Yeah man, what the fuck?!   (subscribed) Nuclear energy, etc. I consider it one of the most misunderstood by people outside of the field. To be fair, it says right [here](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/special-procedures/traveling-children) that you can just tell TSA that you don't want it x-rayed and they won't.  But that may not be the case in other countries. > Is there any risk of low frequency EM radiation   You're describing electronic noise, which should be well insulated by the laptop components. This noise is radio waves and can't hurt you, because they don't interact with the DNA of your cells. That's why we are able to have nice things like AM/FML radio, satellite comm, GPS, WiFi, etc.  &nbsp;  >or any radiation whatsoever?  There is radiation from the laptop, and you're feeling it in the form of heat (and also conduction). It could hurt you by heating your skin, but it's not damaging your cellular DNA. Structural  DNA damage means everything, because it determines whether or not a cell dies. The same thing goes for the radiation reaching your eyes from the screen. It's in the visible region of the light spectrum -- it's non ionizing. Radiation starts to ionize and damage your DNA toward the ultraviolet portion and beyond. You can think of a sunburn as the first sign of radiation induced damage. UVB has enough energy to damage the skin cell DNA, but it takes some time to take effect. This is why you can be out in the sun all day and not notice a horrible sunburn until later on in the evening. Ever had a sunburn flake off? Those are the cells that decided to commit suicide because the radiation was damaging the DNA (see: apoptosis). Cancer patients who undergo xray therapy experience levels of this skin surface burn in their treatment area.  &nbsp;  >because the only negative ""studies"" I found where from sketchy websites that try to sell me stuff.  Say it with me: ""snakeoil"". You will find an absurd amount of misinformation out there on radiation. YouTube is particularly bad (see: WiFi Danger). The facts are, it's a narrowly studied and extremely complicated field. Most physicists don't go into it much unless they're treating cancer or sending detectors to space. To suggest that scientists are ""hiding something"" or don't understand radiation safety is complete balderdash (see: ALARA, AAPM, ICRU, the ABR, USNRC). I could go on forever.             If the em has low enough energy that it's making it through the plastic, it won't hurt you (except perhaps for a contact burn).  If the em has high enough energy that it's making it through the plastic, your computer would be a brick.  Anything in between isn't escaping the plastic.  tldr; no.   No one was talking about emotional or compensatory damages. The whole point is to highlight the fuckery going on in the name of security theater, embarrass those responsible for it, and put an end to it. That's why I said I hope she sues, because a trial would bring sustained media attention. There should be. I would not be satisfied with them just stopping this, if it were me I would want some *personal* justice.  Maybe the people involved should face criminal charges for sexual harrasment, and is there some sort of ""non piv rape"" thing? like, forcing somebody to milk themselves in front of you is definitely going past mere ""sexual harrasment"" yes, I am sure the great PM of Hessen would give a shit.  Hint: he does not. The guy covered the ass of a secret agent who, at least, as a bare minimum, lied during investigations for the biggest murder spree in our history, and was (at worst) helping a Neo-Nazi terrorist group kill innocent civilians, and who was collecting Nazi materials on the side And the article states.  >Second, the U.S. does not look special. From the litigation stories that dominate the newspapers -- $2.86 million coffee spills, Pokemon class actions, and $246 billion tobacco settlements -- the U.S. courts do look odd. Yet most litigation involves nothing like those disputes and, in turn, these bizarrely exceptional disputes do not skew data like suits filed or the number of judges. Ordinary litigation involves car crashes and broken contracts. These disputes dominate the courts. All wealthy democracies use courts to resolve this kind of routine dispute, and those courts resolve them similarly. In the process, they help insure the stability of property rights and facilitate efficient levels of investment. Indeed, a central reason these countries are wealthy lies in the way  >The U.S. is exceptional not in the way it handles first-order law (the rest of this Sec. II), but in the way it handles second-order law (Sec. III, below). In the typical accident or contract claim, U.S. courts do reasonably well. They may face somewhat more litigation than other rich democracies, but not much.  What's this have to do with feminism? This is just a fucked up thing to make someone do Seriously, what?  Are you confusing the baggage xraying which has been a fairly standard practice for 30 something years with backscatter x-ray or millimeter x-ray scanners for scanning people?   You really need to reevaluate your username. You don't need to know that. The fact is that EVERY airport in the world scans your carry on baggage to make sure there isn't anything inside against the current regulations. One could assume from there that if it's good enough for your carry on luggage to be scanned with, an exposed breast pump should serve no problem. Your fallice here is assuming that the USA has better Airport security by virtue of being the USA. Ever been to JFK, Hartford, or Boston Logon? Massive hubs, awful terminals, sporadic security. We aren't #1 friend, haven't been for some time.  Why are you all about scanner equality?  They are the models that are capable of scanning a breast milk pump. The bot would of responded but we could of broken it with our grammar > I *would* of never seen this coming yup, but its kinda assinine and overprotective. Its like people who refuse to let their kids eat anything thats touched plastic >computer would be a brick  Care to elaborate?  When you put it like that, then absolutely, I agree. I was just trying to point out that there is no direct analogue to 'suing' in continental Europe, at least in the way that term is often used in american vernacular. What I actually found interesting was that while we have about 25 pct more litigations we have 2x as many judges. I know how American courts are portrayed I wonder how it actually is and how it is compared to the UK. > Are you confusing the baggage xraying which has been a fairly standard practice for 30 something years with backscatter x-ray or millimeter x-ray scanners for scanning people?  nope.  i guess it is true what they say: ignorance is bliss.  good luck my friend.  scanner equality? you mean in the sense that they all deserve equal rights? how does that even make sense in your head? these are machines, not people.  kinda sounds like you just made that up. source?

Radiation with high enough energy to pierce the plastic shell would cause sparking and component failure inside the laptop.  Frankfurt is a major hub for international travel. They have explosive residue testing, x-rays, drug dogs, you name it.

"16",15,"5r70xj","2017-01-31","Iranian Americans do not have the option of renouncing their Iranian ancestry to circumvent the problem. Iran considers anyone born in the country, or born to an Iranian father, to be an Iranian national, leaving many Americans of Iranian descent with no choice over their own dual identities. Iran baiting their nationals to come back to iran and get stuck. lmao What about the hikers who accidentally crossed the border in Iran and were jailed?   Misleading title. Article states this only applies to retroactive visas. They are still going to ban people from the US going forward. Iran: Americans are free to come here. Leaving the country may cost extra, though. Will this permission also last 90 days? This is exactly like Linda Sarsour extolling the virtues of Saudi Arabian maternity policy. It's still a country with a horrific human rights effort. I'll happily stay in America, but thanks.  I think I'll stay here, thanks. Lol Can Israelis? ...and be arrested as spies. .. and never leave Getting in is the easy part it's getting out that's the problem  The USA is the worst country on Earth. Amirite guise?  Upboats to the left! But not Israelis, who are banned from all 7 of the countries the US has banned. Iran doesn't recognize dual citizenship and will indefinitely hold Iranian Americans, claiming they are just Iranians and the US has no right to interfere with their citizens. But go ahead reddit, suck Iran's dick because you hate trump.  Then go ahead and cut your nose off to spite your face   Edit: switched Iranians to Iran  We just may arrest and torture you for a few years.... You know thats nice, but why has the goverment put up banners in public places saying Death to America Death to Israel?  Well isn't Iran so virtuous all of a sudden. But Israelis can't It's a trap! If youre a businessman in Europe and youre thinking about doing business in Iran once the sanctions are lifted, and maybe you have continuing business interests in the US, you might think twice about going to Iran because thats going to impact your travelling to America, where it may be your prime market. You might say, It would have been nice to go but its just not worth the penalty of now having to get a visa to go to the US. So in some way its a perpetuation of the sanctions, Wait...didn't Iran just ban ALL Americans from entering because of Trump's immigration hold? But they may arrest them for some BS reason. You know, like they have a habit of doing. Right, but not Israelis. Cause they can't get visas. Because Iran banned Israel from getting visas.  EDIT: Before you smack that disagree button, not an Israeli government supporter *at all*, but there isn't a government in the middle east that shouldn't be dismantled. What's with the Iran hate? I can understand why Iranians would hate America because we overthrew their government and then unseated their democratically elected one to replace with an American pawn who fucked over their nation, but why the reverse?  Thanks for the offer Iranian government, but I'll take a hard pass Oh good. I've been so worried as me and all my friends are always going to Iran for the holidays. It's always such a popular place to spend winter break.  I understand most of reddit obviously doesn't want to visit Iran, but as a dual citizen who has half of their family living in Iran this is very relieving.  Seriously, how many (non Iranian) Americans are going to Iran?  Those that do probably have business with Iranian national companies thereby directly benefiting the Iranian economy so not really a valid comparison - still a stupid ban though. ...and get detained as a spy.  I understand why they ban Syria and Iraq but why Iran? There is 0 ISIS or any terrorist there. Iran will never allow that! Good guy Iran over here taking the moral high ground. What a time to be alive. Meanwhile Pakistan, fearing a ban, is cracking down on militant groups. But that won't make the front page of reddit any time soon.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/pakistan-fearing-us-visa-ban-cracks-down-on-militant-group/2017/01/31/31412514-e7bb-11e6-903d-9b11ed7d8d2a_story.html?tid=sm_tw&utm_term=.22080c8cd126   So they can arrest and torture you and hold you for ransom. Jews cant. American here.  Don't worry guys, I'll stay home.  Give my spot to someone else, it's cool. Didn't Iran literally just ban American immigrants in response to the ban..? What about Israelis?  Taking the high road. Whew, that was close.... /s How about Israelis?  You can't get into some of these countries with any passport from any country if there is even a single stamp from Israel in it.   What about people from Israel? I would love to visit there some day. Remember when Romney was campaigning against Obama on the promise to invade Iran?!?  Get ready, people.  Republicans love war and they are in control.  They will use any excuse to go to war and every excuse will be blamed on Obama.  Trumpets will brigade every Iran article, too.   Except Israeli's can't go to Iran... Just not Israelis. Iran has no claim to any moral high-ground. Do you still need to have two people write letters from.within Iran in order to be able to get a visa? Not a valid comparison, as Iran doesn't have a target painted on them for extremists and terrorists as we do. My roommate is Persian (Iranian).  I've never met, nor has he, a single Iranian-American that would ever under any circumstances set foot in Iran again. and who wants to go to Iran? It's the leaving part that might be hard. It's actually been difficult of people with iranian nationality to get into the US for decades but no one cared much about it before.  Sweet...? Yes, but can they leave? They neglect to mention how incredibly hard it is to get an Iranian visa. and Iraaaan, Iran so far awaaaaayy. Couldn't get away. ...They just might not be able to leave.   Can an Israeli citizen get an Iranian visa?   Yeah, cause we aren't there to blow shit up or instill a ""christian rule"".  Are people this stupid? It's a trap! Yes, but Iran requires Americans to have a minder.  So, not that great. Good guy Iran with this it will spark a revolution. MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST GREAT AGAIN! It's just a pause while we figure out how to tell the difference between Iranian and Uranium.  That's like offering souls in purgatory passage to hell. I guess it's the thought that counts? Nope! My aunt just wen there a couple months ago and was turned down. She went to Georgia instead.  Sorry, Iran.  We are definitely the dicks now. Classy as fuck.  Please give us some time to sort this out. Let it not be forgotten that Americans who enter Iran are   #required to have a full-time government approved escort  Yeah. It is not the same at all   umm thats funny because people with Israeli passports cant come to Iran, double standard much?  yea but once there and they accused you of being a spy they will throw your ass in jail and we will see your pictures on newspapers. That moment when even Iran's immigration laws are more liberal and better than USA That day when Americans realize they are more fascist than Iran. .... and can get taken in the middle of the night, held against their will and changed with espionage without evidence.  yup sounds like a great place to go! Did we really lose the moral high ground...to fucking Iran?!?! Implying Americans want to go to Iran But can Israelis?  I'm pretty sure people with visas and green cards can be let in and it was only 2 days where they couldn't so how about we stop trying to create bad arguments on the basis of something that is no longer in existence. > Iran considers anyone born in the country, or born to an Iranian father, to be an Iranian national  Just a father? No mother? Weird. That's not true. America recognizes the renunciation of Iranian citizenship, Canada does as well. If you were to travel to back to Iran after doing so, Iran does not recognize it. But America does. Intresting. So a Isreal women and a Iranian man can get a child and than there would be somebody with an Iranian and israel passport. cool. Iranian Americans are not an issue. The order does not cover US citizens who also hold dual nationality with one of the affected countries. US citizens have an absolute right to enter the country.  You've probably seen reports of the order affecting people with dual citizenship, which is about people who hold dual citizenship with an affected country and some third country. For example, a Canadian-Iranian would be prohibited from entering the US under this order. Are you saying it's impossible to rid yourself of Iranian citizenship? Sounds far fetched...  Couldn't you legally denounce it or whatever and then have it no be recognized by the US/Canada wherever?  Article 988 - Iranian nationals cannot abandon their nationality except on the following conditions:  1 - That they have reached the full age of 25.  2 - That the Council of Ministers has allowed their renunciation of their Iranian nationality.  3 - That they have previously undertaken to transfer, by some means or other, to Iranian nationals, within one year from the date of the renunciation of their Iranian nationality, all the rights that they possess on landed properties in Iran or which they may acquire by inheritance although Iranian laws may have allowed the possession of the same properties in the case of foreign nationals. The wife and children of the person who renounces his nationality according to this Article do not lose their Iranian nationality, whether the children are minors or adult, unless the permission of the Council of Ministers allows them to renounce their nationality;  4 - That they have completed their national military service.  Note A -Those who may venture to apply for the renunciation of their Iranian nationality according to this Article in favor of a foreign nationality must, besides carrying out the stipulations of Clause 3 of this Article, leave Iran within three months. If they fail to do so, the proper authorities will issue Deportation Orders for their expulsion and will sell their property. The above - mentioned prescribed grace period may be extended subject to the approval of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs up to a maximum period of one year.  Note B - The Council of Minister may in the course of approving the denunciation of nationality by an unmarried Iranian woman, approve the denunciation of the nationality of her children provided that they are without father or paternal grandfather and are less than 18 years of age, or otherwise lack legal capacity. Also her children of less than 25 years of age can denounce their nationality in conformity with their mothers denunciation of nationality  From another reddit post here: [Iranian Citizenship](https://www.reddit.com/r/iran/comments/25b4vy/renounce_iranian_citizenship/) Yup jus soli vs jus sanguinis. He's saying they're going to honor Iranian visas. Basically even if you're white as driven snow, if you've had a trip scheduled to Iran for some reason you're still welcome to come.  And conversely even if you are born in Saudi Arabia and lived there your whole life you would not necessarily have Saudi citizenship unless you are descended from Saudi's. If your parents were from a country you will always be a foreigner they don't consider you a citizen if they don't know you exist ;) > born to an Iranian father  Ouch. well if youve hd your passport stamped in Israel you cant go to Iran either. ever.  > or born to an Iranian father  Interesting...as an American born to an Iranian father....uhh shit haha. Accuse them of spying and hold them for ransom like those poor hikers. They didn't have visas but Iran was nice enough to let them in anyway, and give them a place to sleep and food to eat. :D I like how everyone is conveniently forgetting about how often Iran had done this in the past.  What about them? How is that relevant? Why are you talking? Or the American Navy personnel they held hostage?  Not misleading at all. That's the major point of contention over Trump's executive order: People who already had visas, including permanent residents who'd lived in the US for years, were pulled off planes and turned away at airports.  Iran is using just a smidge of common sense in the creation of its ban, unlike Trump & Bannon. Can we expect Iranians protesting there? Or judge overruling the order?  So, you're saying that Iran honoring existing visas is misrepresented by the title that say ""people with visa can enter the country""?  Remember that the thing happening in the US bans people with existing visas to enter. Yes, we're living in an age where Iran is more respectful of laws than the US :(  edit: I'm only talking about the visa issue; Iran is still Iran after you crossed the border. The US ban is simply a temporary 90 day ban while they review and revise their visa verification processes anyways.  Exactly. Are they going to issue more? No?  Then why is this even news? yeah there's no love lost between iran and america. there was the missile attack spree by the iran-backed houthi in october, and earlier this week the houthi pulled a USS Cole style attack on a saudi warship that seems to have either been intended for an american warship or a sort of rehearsal for an attack on an american warship. [here's an article with a video of the attack](http://dailycaller.com/2017/01/31/pentagon-believes-us-was-intended-target-in-saudi-frigate-bombing-video/) Linda Sarsour hates Saudi Arabia and routinely speaks out against them. Take your character assasination elsewhere What, you don't want to vacation in an Islamic theocracy?  How closed minded of you. Came here to say this. Silly bigoted Americans, here in Iran we treat everyone with respect except for women and Jews, but then again they aren't people. Of course not. Which is why this whole shitstorm is incredibly hypocritical. If Iran doesn't allow anyone with an Israeli passport (or even just an Israeli stamp in their foreign passport!) to enter the country, then they deserve to be banned from the US as well.  My mother always used to tell me, ""never compare yourself to the worst"".                 I feel like there has been a lot of this going on from Americans lately. Nice way to derail the argument. We all know that those countries are not heaven on earth, but that doesn't mean the USA should follow right away.  also anyone that has an israeli stamp on their passport...   Maybe they shouldn't assassinate their scientists. Poor little Israel And vice versa Huh, in Russia there's a saying ""To poke one eye out so your mother- in-law would have a one-eyed son-in-law"" (sounds better because there are words for 'one-eyed', 'son-in-law', and most importantly 'mother-in-law') Hey at least Iranians can still be ""Happy!"" -Pharrell  Your anti-iranian bias is quite clear from your post history. However, your comment is blatantly false - dual citizens are rarely prevented from leaving Iran, although there have been cases of dual citizens being jailed for (sometimes controversial) reasons unrelated to nationality. As an Iranian American ive gone back and forth all my life and never had issues, and i know plenty of people who do so as well. That's to show their love and tolerance because they didn't elect Trump.  <--- pls recognize my diversity with upvotes As someone who fled Iran as a child as a refugee. I can tell you that I see a lot of the characteristics in Trump that I thought I had left behind in Iran and the Ayatollas that run that country. Going after reporters, lying and believing in your own lies, religious rules, isolationism. The list goes on. Trump has dictator qualities. ...in this case, by comparison - yes The number of Republicans who told me that Trump was the lesser of two evils, but then cheer as he bans Iranian nationals but not Saudis is fucking staggering. Israelis who have dual citizenship can (and do) visit. I mean, for a large enough company you just send some people to Iran and a different group of people to the US. This thing won't be all that difficult for large corporations to circumvent, it's a burden on private citizens just trying to live their lives. I had no trouble doing that for pleasure.    Why would the US cause problems for business people potentially bringing money to the states?  Yes.  They just made it so that it doesn't fuck those up that already finished their traveling preperations. If you ask now to get allowance to enter Iran as an American, then you won't be allowed, however, if you already asked, then you can still enter. And then its a straight trip to torture town, Iran's favorite amusement park(its fun for the guards, at least). > Before you smack that disagree button, not an Israeli government supporter at all, but there isn't a government in the middle east that shouldn't be dismantled.  Think *real hard* about that sentence. Are you an American? Because I am. If you are, I would hope you'd learn from the blunders we've made over the years where it comes to destabilizing regimes, and if you aren't, please look at US history as a cautionary tale.   Advocating the dismantling of more regimes in that part of the world is hardly a savvy geopolitical move.  That's because Iran doesn't recognize Israel, which regardless of your opinion about that makes sense. On top of that there is no official diplomatic relations between the two as far as I know. That makes the two situations quite different. Last I heard Israel was not a US State. You go deal with them yourself...  There were plenty of jews living in muslim countries, until israel was created and started stealing land from their neighbours. Israels own fault for being shit heads. > EDIT: Before you smack that disagree button, not an Israeli government supporter at all, but there isn't a government in the middle east that shouldn't be dismantled.  Are you implying that there is a legitimate government in the world which shouldn't be dismantled ? If so please point out which I would like to understand what makes them different. The hate is because if the US government wants to try to destabilize Iran again, they first have to make it look as the aggressor. It's the same with Russia, China, Lybia, Cuba... Iran openly supports Hezbollah and the Houthi terrorist organizations.  Obama created the list, dont believe me? look for yourself  dont be a pleb. yes, they did, but unlike the US debacle they are not retroactively stopping people with active visa's.  You know, why many people from the countries trump has banned are left stranded as they planned to use their legally issued visa's to come to the US.     *taking the ""Our country is a shithole and we'll take any decent human being willing to live here"" road.  I fixed you typo for you :) You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.  Painted by yourselves no less. Is he a Muslim Iranian or a Jewish Iranian? My ex-colleague was French-Iranian.  He came along when three people from our company went to Iran for a week on business.  You know, so we'd have a local with us. It wasn't for me.  Work HR applied at the embassy, I got it a few days later.  Then again it may be harder for Americans. Nope, nor are they permitted to get a Visa from any member of the Arab League, as well as Malaysia (unless unique permission is granted). But you are there to sow political dissent.  No... I heard here on reddit that americans went and traveled trough the country on motorcycles a few years ago, and I don't think they were escorted Well, stop threatening to nuke the place and they might warm up to you a little.  You're no kinda fucking prize yourself.   Par for the course in the patriarchal middle east, honestly. I know Lebanon and Syria are the same, and probably many others too.  Does this extend for more than one generation? Many countries consider ethnic or national identity to inherited by the male line. Considering it's a strict Islamic theocracy, no, it's not weird.  Which is kind of irrelevant. The US wouldn't send you back because you got conscripted or drafted in Iran even if you had recognized Iranian citizenship.  The whole problem stems from people going back or going there for the first time and not knowing they might end up having to do a stint in the military or go to jail.   Last I heard there were about 150,000 Israelis born in Iran (like former president [Moshe Katsav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Katsav),) I figure there are more born of Iranian fathers and so technically Iranian-Israeli. There might be a little drama when applying for both, but, it's possible. There used to be a huge Jewish diaspora in Iran (old Persian lands), a lot of whom emigrated in the 70s. but there are still over 10000 Jews living in Iran and practicing judaism now.  This is how it works with all countries. Children born to two parents of differing citizenship get both at birth. You can renounce Iranian citizenship. It's just ridiculously difficult to do.  Source: Was listening to an Iranian born australian MP talking about it on the radio today (he had to ditch his Iranian citizenship to hold office). It required ""a team of lawyers in both countries"" and even then his passport still says Iranian born so it's unlikely that would mean anything if he had been in an American airport.  The French treat citizenship that way so I could see how the Iranians do it as well Well I don't know about Iran but I have a dual citizenship with Brazil/USA and I can tell you I tried getting rid of my Brazillian citizenship and they wouldn't let me, I'm sure there's a way but it's not at all simple or easy There's some BS council that has to approve it in Iran. You yourself cannot simply renounce your citizenship - the final decision is out of your hands.   My family is from Iran - that shit sticks man.  Sounds like Hinduism - you are an atheist? Well, nope, you are  ""Hindu atheist"". You are a Buddhist? Nope, you are a Hindu after all Buddhism is a school of Hindu philosophy and Buddha was an avatar of Vishnu.  Sort of like a clingy ex who never lets go. Sure, but people are saying that's not what's happening at the border. Also, Canada and the US are different countries (shocker I know). The official policy of the US government is to not recognize dual America-foreign citizenship and to highly discourage dual foreign-foreign citizenship. On the other hand, Canada is neutral towards dual citizens. Thus, for the most part, America mainly considers the passport you're traveling on, not what potential nationalities you may possess. Of course, some news outlets are claiming they are screening for this, while others aren't. It's really hard to say. thank god! This is how it works in most of the world, including Europe. Granting citizenship to people born in the country to foreign parents happens only in the Americas. Well those hikers were rather dumb. They were repeatedly warned (as is anyone traveling on sensitive borders in the Middle East) not to stray too close.   And guess what? They did. And got nabbed.   If they really wanted to see Iran they could have just purchased a tour of it.  Yes and let them stay indefinitely Iran does a lot of terrible shit.  Just like everyone likes to forget that the US (and UK) directed and financed a coup in Iran, toppled their democracy and put a terror regime in power, which the US then supported for decades. All this for oil. Several hundreds died in the riots alone (and US paid infamous thugs to go on riots).  The thing is, that there were no terror attacks in the west by Iranians in recent history, yet Iran is banned while Saudi Arabia isn't. Keep in mind that most of the 9/11 terrorist came from Saudi Arabia. Americans had a war about being allowed to keep slaves, but that's in the past. Pushing someone back into the dirt because of their past will never allow them to change. If we never forgive, we'd all be the bad guys Oh well if they didn't have visas just put them in jail for eight years.  Sounds fair. They weren't held hostage they were legally apprehended after accidentally crossing into Iran's territory. They reversed the green card holder bit on Sunday. Probably not since this is a reactionary move.  I can never understand which side these statements are intended to attack. The country that popularized the term ""Death to America""?  No, probably not. No, cause not an awful lot of Americans live in Iran, and people boarding airplanes and already with visas weren't mistreated, and the statement Iran's FM released said they regret what the US government have done, they respect American citizen and this is a retaliation to that and would be in order as long as that is and the president said should countries should have open borders, Where Trump flat out disrespected 7 nations!  She sounds horrible. Her friends are terrorists, her cousin is a terrorist, her brother is a terrorist. Also, if she likes Sharia law so much why wouldn't she go somewhere that abides by it?  http://www.snopes.com/2017/01/25/womens-march-organizer-linda-sarsour/  Those were her own words on SA.  She also refuses to denounce institutional sharia and has spoken of institutional sharia in other nations positively on a few occasions. She defended leaving Hillary Clinton off a list of honored women at a march that came to be in large part because she lost.  I'm not assassinating anyone's character unless her Facebook and her twitter were hacked.  Ok so you seem a bit like you hate America but then at the same time are angry about the travel ban. Make up your mind. Should people even want to come to this horrible country?  If you and miss Sarsour hate this country so much, go live in one of those banned countries.  I know you're being half sarcastic, but I've been in Iran and it's a terrific place to visit, people are very nice too. And of course there are no gays in Iran, everybody knows this. So anyone who bans people deserves to be banned by other people? So building on this, in the long term, no one should be allowed in any country other than his own? Well, even if Iran did let Israelis enter, they couldn't, cause Israel bans any Israelis to enter Iran...  Israelis are banned from entering these countries by Isreal:  Iran, Pakistan, Iraq, Libya, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Yemen  Israel is also essentially closed for all the countries that ban Israelis. While Israel do not have an official ban on these countries, tourists from these countries need to have specific government granted permission, which they are very unlikely to get unless they have a very good reason.  Essentially, there is no hypocrisy - these countries are mutually banning each other. I think it's important to differentiate the choices of a government vs the actual thoughts of the people. Only because the government is extremist doesn't mean that the general public believes the same things.  Golly gee then, if America is banning these countries, then America should be banned by other countries as well! > then they deserve to be banned from the US as well.  what's the logic behind it?  If you ban somebody I ban you too?  Then I'd like to ban US citizens from entering Italy because they banned 7 countries.  There's no logic in your statement. ""He started it!"".  Why the fuck should innocent citizens be punished for the crimes of their governments? No Iranian has bombed or assasinated people in the USA.  Israel on the other hand has as of last count assasinated 5 Iranian Nuclear scientists and no, it is not a conspiracy theory, their defence minister (Israeli) openly threatened Iran that if they didn't stop their nuclear program, Mossad will keep assasinating more of them. Ofc, some pleasant American politicians like Newt Gingrich and Santorum considered these assasinations as wonderful things and that more should take place.  Israel has bombed convoys in Syria, taking out Iranian generals.  Not the same at all. I don't support the ban, but the issue is not the same.   >  Which is why this whole shitstorm is incredibly hypocritical.  Actually Israeli's can and do visit Iran.  Yep, you think we're bad?? Look at these other horrible places, they've been doing what we're doing for a long time! Two wrongs make a right, right? I've never heard that one, but I like it. If I'm a little evil, but you're a *lot* evil, I'm not better because of it.   It is also a natural response to, ""Could be worse...*(insert horrible scenario)*"" in response to someone else's misfortune, typically in attempt to downplay it. It's usually clumsily used to try to comfort someone, but always fails to do so.  Never compare to the worst event, either. Your mother was probably right with that quote. The point of this article is to give Iran the moral high ground. They do not deserve the moral high ground.  Just because you disagree doesn't mean they are ""derailing the argument""  If you can't beat their racism, join em, AM I RIGHT?  /s They don't. 4 scientists assassinated during 2011-2012, none assassinated since. No, Israel does not ban any other country's citizens entry.  Furthermore, It did not stamp the passports of those from those who visit countries who ban Israelis to prevent them having a problem in their these countries later on.  edit: as pointed out in a comment, nowadays, there's no stamping for anyone. Do they? It doesn't seem like Israel bans Iranians. Blatantly false? Here is a link for you  https://www.google.com/amp/www.al-monitor.com/pulse/en/originals/2016/10/iran-dual-nationals-citizenship-key-controversy.amp.html  Based on article 41 of the Iranian constitution Iran does not recognize dual citizenship  Even a blind squirrel busts a nut from time to timr Actually, people with visas can still enter the US. People were misinterpreting the rules set on the ban and those who were originally refused entry have been told they are in fact allowed back in.   Also, a similar ban was set in place in 2011 on Iraqi refugees while Obama was on a killing frenzy with drones killing innocent people but I guess we already forgot about that. Not to mention that this ban was already set up previously by the Obama administration and just had not yet been implemented. The countries listed were ""countries of concern"" according to the Obama administration, not Trump, which is why there are only seven of them.   Regardless, it is a shitty situation, but people should seriously begin fact checking before they go to the internet voicing their feelings on the subject. Trump isn't the only bad guy here.  What about Israelis who don't?  Something team Trump obviously didnt consider. Not American, meant dismantled by the people democratically. Some nations that is literally impossible, as they still rely on outdated concepts such as royalty or outright dictatorships. I understand what you mean though, and foreign intervention is a last resort should the alternative be nuclear war, not money or political points.   I have family from Libya, I'm very much aware of the follies of US foreign policy Right so if America turned around and just ended all relations and stopped recognising it then it's fine?  > which regardless of your opinion about that makes sense  1) Why they don't recognize Israel? Also, does it mean now that they can pretend Israelis do not exist?  2) When they write ""Admission refused to holders of passports or travel documents containing a visa/stamp for **Israel** or any data that passenger has been to Israel or indication of any"" aren't they referring to a country which, as they think, doesn't exist? But why are Iranians welcomed in Israel? Your second point doesn't make sense >until israel was created and started stealing land from their neighbours.  1) Israel was created by the UN  2) Land belonged to the british  3) Most of the ""theft"" happened during wars which were initiated by the neighbors  4) Even the six day war, even though it was a preemptive attack How exactly jews living in muslim countries were responsible for the creation of Israel ? When by plenty you mean more than 0, then yes. Any Government that doesn't slaughter civilians or recklessly kill them is the bare minimum in my mind. Innocents is the only priority, otherwise you get bogged down in politics where you liberate Iraq but let North Korea torture it's population.   And by dismantled I meant internally, the last thing we need is more foreign intervention (coming from someone with family from Libya)  Atheist as far as I know. How was it?  Honestly I'd love to go some day.  Iranians are some of the nicest people I've ever met. well, since that's the instant topic... Not actually true - since 2006, citizenship is passed on through either parent. And before 2006, it could still be passed on by the father but only if your parents were married at the time you tried to claim citizenship. Didn't know that either, I wonder why it's like that. Poland too. I think... All I was told is that because my mother was actually born in Poland I can get a Polish citizenship. Except for Jews, where the mother's ancestry is what matters. Half black half-iranian jewish ex-muslim gay israeli-american rabbi, who is against creationism... It doesn't get better than this. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dario_Hunter Cyrus The Great went to Babylon and freed all the jewish slaves; Iran has an incredibly large number of Jewish people; If I recall correctly, it's the second highest concentration next to Israel. Just goes to show you how different the country is outside of their stupid idiotic government.  Wow, I had no idea. Do you have any knowledge about what life is like for them? Are there conflicts with neighbors? Or is it pretty chill? Hush now, that doesn't follow the narrative. i can second this.. its a very complicated lengthy process that i am not even fully aware of. i was born and raised in germany. parents are iranian. I only went a hand full of times to visit grandma and stuff. i just found out that i still have an iranian passport. I wasn't even aware of it until my dad told me yesterday. I am in the US as a F-1 student now and frankly just stranded. My parents whom i havent seen in 3 years can't visit me due to their dual citizenship and my lawyer told me not to leave as i won't be allowed back in.. It is just unbelievable. Sam Dastyari? Was that Sam Dastyari? ^ Iranian jurisprudence is basically ripped off of late 19th century France and Belgium's and throwing in a few Islamic decrees for the sake of it. You can get rid of French citizenship though.  For those looking to renounance citizenship and become a U.S citizen. You do it through a United States consular or the State Department. https://www.usembassy.gov   I wish you the best of luck.    Edit:This is obviously only how you start the process curious, why would you want to? That really doesn't make sense, because a person's religion is self defined whereas nationality is defined by the country. Not really. Most countries have conditional jus soli, with the conditions deviating between countries. Its very rare to be as restrictive as Saudi Arabia They were sentenced to prison for 8 years.   What about the Iranian hostages in the 80s?  Iran does this stuff all the time. Livin it up at the hotel Tehran. That's what happens when your military boat enters another nations waters.    If a bunch of Iranians drifted near the coast of Florida how do you think we'd have handled it? Denying entry into your country isn't inherently evil.  It is asserting your own sovereignty and it is done by literally everyone. Which is sort of why they're on the list. Yup, which sucks because the people seem perfectly nice.   Hopefully this Trump bs doesn't effect the election of the next supreme leader. With any luck, a new supreme leader could really make the government less dickish.  Edit: clarified what i meant > Pushing someone back in the dirt  This is not what an immigration ban is.  When we get to the point where we're comparing stricter vetting practices to slavery we may need to look in a mirror.  Maybe it would be fairer country if the USA hadn't destroyed democracy in Iran in the 50s. hindsight is 2020 I guess Virtually every country on the planet requires visas for at least some people to enter, and punishes those who violate the requirement.  I'm beginning to think that nobody has the slightest clue how international travel actually works. How the fuck is everyone so clueless? Oh, right, I'm in /r/worldnews. And then I believe they were released without any problems as well CAN'T YOU SEE THERE IS A CIRCLE JERK GOING ON HERE.  ^fuck After people were pulled off planes out of blue.  If you love Russia so much move there Troll is troll. If you love fasicm move to North Korea mate. Just don't be gay and it's great. Must have thrown them all off of buildings already. That's been the logic hasn't it? Aren't UK citizens trying to ban Trump from visiting because he banned people?  If you ban people based on where they were born and then someone does the same to you, you do kind of forefeit your right to complain about it. That's how visas have been for ages. Quid pro quo.   Russians, for example, have a pain the dick process to maybe get a chance for a U.S. visa. So in turn they make it pretty expensive and a pain in the ass for Americans to go there. It's not exact 1:1 but it's the same general concept. Tit for tat etc.  These countries ban people who have visited Israel.  This has nothing to do with the passport.   That's not really an explanation. It is quite clearly hypocritical to ban a group of people based on where they were born and then to complain when someone does the same to you. Iran didn't exist in the 1850s I believe he meant precisely the opposite. First, you are forgetting that Iran was the one who started the hostilities with Israel. The Iranian ban on Israelis predates all the events you cited.  Second, Israel never admitted of being involved in the assassinations. You are wrong about that.  Third, Israel and Syria are at war. If Iranian generals aid Israel's enemies, they are valid targets.  Fourth, there are hundreds of thousands of Iranians in Israel. Israel's former President was born in Iran. Israel has nothing against the Iranian people, only against the insane Islamist theocratic dictatorship that wants to destroy Israel. Exactly, at this rate, its just a race to the bottom...

Maybe Iran does it to avoid Mossad agents assassinating their scientists. > They do not deserve the moral high ground.  Why not? Iran hasn't been spending the past 2 decades invading 2 countries in the region and bombing god knows how many others.  Disagreeing with what? So you're saying that you know for a fact Israel will never try to assassinate Iranian scientists again?  Now days they don't stamp any passports at all. Get an entry ticket when you arrive, an exit ticket when you leave. No stamps. Well from the fact checking I've done...  The 2011 ban was in response to a specific, foiled terror attack on US soil by Iraqi refugees, to which I would suggest a stay on Iraqi refugees is probably a rational response. Iraqi refugees still came in, but at a far lower rate, for those six months.  The list of countries to which Trump refers were not from a ban. It was a revision of the Visa waiver program by Obama allowing people into America without a Visa for a short period of time. However you were not entitled to visit under that waiver if you had been to any of the 7 countries since 2011. It wasn't a ban on getting a visa or coming to the US or anything like that.  http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/30/donald-trump/why-comparing-trumps-and-obamas-immigration-restri/ > Actually, people with visas can still enter the US  No, they can not. The [executive order](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/politics/refugee-muslim-executive-order-trump.html) stops everyone from the 7 countries to enter.  >  I hereby proclaim that the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and **I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of such persons** for 90 days from the date of this order (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas).  The exceptions are diplomatic visas listed above and since then [green card holders are also exempt](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-immigration-greencard-idUSKBN15C0KX). But, all other immigrant and non-immigrant visas are suspended.  > Also, a similar ban was set in place in 2011 on Iraqi refugees while Obama  Obama never invalidated existing visas, Trump has.  >  Not to mention that this ban was already set up previously by the Obama administration and just had not yet been implemented.  That was a visa waiver program. ""Actually, people with visas can still enter the US. People were misinterpreting the rules set on the ban and those who were originally refused entry have been told they are in fact allowed back in.""  At first they didnt get accapted. The white house had to fix it after they realized the fucked over thousends of people in the US and in other countrys at the same time.   Obama didnt accept iraqi refugees for half a yearc (correctly he just delayed the process for 6 month after that all the iraqi could come to the us)  but its not the same as a travel ban for 7 different countrys affecting almost 200 million people...   T""rump isn't the only bad guy here.""   But he is... he just threw out his attorney general for not obeying him. She has vowed to protect the constitution and would not defend the ban. Then he fired her and replaced her with a yes man. You know where this happens? Litterly every single dictatorship. One  of the first steps is allways to remove unwilling attornes and judges. It happend so many times. How can people not see through this?  I thought Obama wanted that ban because intelligence agencies suspected terrorists among the refugees. In a case like that it is reasonable to instate a ban. Trump's is not based off facts, it's based on feelings. Just look at how the ban does not touch Christians from those countries.  Oh I didn't know Obama was the president again  I didn't say anything about Obama, but fact of the matter is trumps a racist. The ban is racist and anyone who agrees with the ban is racist Not possible - you literally wouldn't be able to get on a flight. The airline wouldn't allow it.  Great username by the way. > Not American, meant dismantled by the people democratically.  Like when the Iranian people tried in the 80s? > Why they don't recognize Israel?   Because they hate the Jews and want to exterminate them. 1. Can't be answered in a short sentence but you'll find plenty of material on the internet to study, which I assume you will do since you seem so eager to learn. Regarding your second part, are you implying that Iran believe that the people you call Israelis actually don't exist? That they are a figment of imagination? 2. You'll have to provide me with a source where Iran uses the name Israel. I don't know if Iran uses ""Israel"" or ""Occupied Palestine"" or something like that in their official documents. Your quote doesn't seem to be straight from Iran. > Israel was created by the UN  The UN recognises vast amounts of land as being under illegal Israeli occupation. Just because the UN created Israel doesn't mean the UN is a-ok with Israel stealing land.  So? Western civilization was a constant threat to those countries why shouldnt they defend themselves against an anti them country just being created to fuck them over. Or should they have waited to be screwed over like how BP and Britain fucked Iran? And even today Israel is still stealing land. Id be sympathetic but their government is shit. Mossad going into countries illegally and shooting a father working as a waiter because they feel hey can do whatever they want. Netushyna(spelling) dissing the united states president acting like he can do whatever he wants. Jews being persecuted in various parts of the world because of Israels aggression. Not to mention their presencr constantly destabalizing an entire region. Fuck em. And since then Israel is still stealing land and still destabiling the region while Mossad enters other countries illegally and shoots working fathers while their leader was constantly insulting to Obama and talks like he can do whatever he wants. No I'm saying that the creating of Israel and their subsequent wars caused Jews around the world to become persecuted and have to flee. I doubt Israel is some society where there isn't a top percentage that control all the power and therefore benefited greatly while others had to flee for their lives. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_exodus_from_Arab_and_Muslim_countries  but hey deny it. Just like Israel denies the Armenian Holocaust because they then couldn't cry about their special victim status ""six million JEWS died at the holocaust, make sure you mention jews or we'll get angry"" Quite interesting.  Obviously I spent most time at work but we found the time for some sightseeing as well.  A cave complex some 300km from Teheran, parks and such in the city, a coffee shop with the best chocolate milkshake in the world (according to them, and it was good) and even a concert of traditional Iranian music and whirling dervishes.  It was quite interesting actually.  Traffic in Iran though is seriously bonkers.  Crossing the road in Vietnam/Thailand/Philippines is simple compared to Teheran. Not if they were born in colonial Hong Kong. Tis why I couldn't get a UK passport .   Pretty much useless now anyway,  but was once the gateway to Europe  The UK is one of the few monarchies to historically have queens that didn't have to ""officially"" be a king. Back when it was that way, I assume the reason was that there's never a dispute over who the mother is. It isn't. Israeli citizenship is actually passed down by either parent. Although things like preistly lineages/tribe are based on the father's ancestry. The names Machine, Label Machine. Iran is not even in the top 10 globally in total Jewish population. They may be higher percentage-wise but given that tiny Belgium has a larger Jewish population than Iran I doubt it. Iran used to have a large number of Jews  Now it has less then a tenth (less then 20,000) it used to and depending on how you count the middle East it's third(after Turkey). Still better then the Arabic countries. Iranian Jews are chillin and the majority are business owners and rich as fook I have no idea actually. I have only been there as a tourist, and I know because of research I did beforehand. A tourist first impression is never a reliable thing to go by either. Iran has a population of 82 million or so, they are a tiny tiny minority.  They are traditionally from rich families and pretty chill people, not exactly celebrated or discriminated against, they are recognized as an official religion by the state, unlike some other minorities like bahais, deravish, yasaran, and they have a seat in the parliament. I used to go to school with many kalmi(iranian jews) students, other people usually treat them like celebrities, the first time anyone finds out someone is a kalimi, there would be lots of questions(probably because you don't see films and series and documents and stuff on tv about Iranian jews unique costumes and traditions and etc, so people are really curious...I think in general we Iranians are rather nosy) Does the passport not have an expiration date? I live in Germany and have a German + Russian citizenship, but I had to renew my Russian passport a few weeks ago and I have to do it every 5 or 10 years. Couldn't they just travel on their German passports? I'm sorry this has happened to you and your family Do you have double citizenship ? if yes the German passport is valid and there is no need to show an iranian one.  At least this is what the german news said 10 minues ago That's the one. I was pretty impressed with that interview, he was well spoken, interesting and every second line wasn't a slogan. It's a low bar, but depressingly rare in aus politics That's not necessarily true.  >France only allows its citizens to renounce their citizenship if they first demonstrate alternative citizenship. They must also prove a ""lack of family and professional ties in France,"" according to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  [Source](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/08/130822-ted-cruz-howto-renounce-citizenship/)  So basically you would have to prove that not only are you not doing business in France, you would have to prove that you do not have family in France. Imagine trying to prove you have no family in the country of which you're a citizen? It's a lot harder than it seems and cannot be done in a time period that would be needed for the Iranians/others right now.  Except Brazil will not recognize it...They'll say ""haha, good try! Ur still Brazilian tho"" In order to renounce citizenship in the way people are talking about, the other country has to recognize it too. Although, despite the fact that some dual nationals have been turned around, some news sources are reporting that the American government says they're only considering the nationality on the passport. In Brazil you're forced to vote every election and if you don't there's a fine, I was also drafted into the army when I turned 18 and since I don't live there I had to excuse myself, however I have had to go back to the consulate to prove that I still live in the US for a few years now every year and I will have to keep doing it for a long while. There are annoyances that I'd rather not deal with and I hardly identify with Brazilian culture. In a perfect world maybe. Sort of, religions also have a bit of cultural surrounding them. So you could be a culturally Jewish atheist, culturally Hindu atheist etc Which tells you what? Maybe to stay away from their border?  > What about the Iranian hostages in the 80s  That was during a revolution. Revolutionaries tend to do shit like that.  Decent service and food, but checkout was a fucking nightmare. 2.5 stars. I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure those hikers were not in possession of a military ship. Obviously an Iranian military vessel in US waters would raise some concerns, but I would imagine the personnel would be detained and returned to Iran. Depending on if the vessel held on strategic benefit, that may be kept, but that isn't any different than Iran keeping our drone that crashed.  The hikers would be much more comparable to illegal immigrants. Last I checked, most illegal immigrants are detained and deported, not held for 5 years, accused of spying, and released after ransom is paid.  I don't think the US is some shining example of decency, but i would much rather be an Iranian detained by the US, than an American detained by Iran. Everyone but the U.S. is allowed to protect their borders and restrict immigration. Do you not reddit? OK in that case why isn't Saudi Arabia on the list??? He also banned refugees, and we aren't iran. Stop trying to degrade america  Ha, I'm just saying if we judge everyone on their past we can never move forward They got 8 years in prison.  A 500k ransom was paid to get them out. Wow, are you 12? Is everyone who disagrees with you a Russian now? Do you even pay bills yet? Not ban him from visiting, they simply don't want it to be a state visit so soon after inauguration and with all of the controversy surrounding his executive order(s). A visit of state involves the royal family as opposed to him just visiting government officials such as the prime minister. We don't have a problem with him visiting. He may be a retarded dickface, but he can still visit.  It's the full meeting the Queen and putting him up at Buckingham Palace that we don't like that. No. They want it downgraded from a state visit to an official visit. A president almost never receives a state visit in their first term, not to mention in their first week. Americans sure do love their saying *""Two wrongs don't make a right.""* Or, that is until they feel the need to spite someone themselves. Can confirm. The Israelis won't stamp your passport to avoid issues with surrounding Muslim countries. I've been around the middle east but have no stamp from Israel. Well, if I visit Crimea I can get in trouble in Ukraine too. That's not the issue though; no one cares if you're born in, say Asia Minor or some other geographical area.  These bans have to do with travelling under the auspices of certain states.  If you are travelling with documents from country A, and country B doesn't recognize country A, you won't get in to B, no matter where you were born. It did. Just named Persia.  I'd say the Netanyahu goverment wants to destroy it as much, he's been under a non stop lobby to do so since 92 Holy fuck what a mess, thanks CIA. Holy shit I really need to get caught up on my history. Thanks for this No, the US did not. You're criticizing the US for doing something that Iran has done for decades, and acting like the US is the worst country on Earth for doing this. And pretending that the Iranians are better for not doing this, even though *they already do this to Israelis*.  Get your head out of your ass dude. Not really. Just pointing out that they are both shit.  How is banning entrance from nations with very high levels of extremism and violence morally wrong? We are talking about countries where being a member of the LGBT community will land you in prison or jail. Where being a rape victim means you're a whore and should be rejected by society (and often imprisoned). Where women are property of their male family.   I'll come out and say it. The ban is overdo. And more countries should be added to it. If you're a liberal who values the rights of all people you can't reconcile that with the belief systems that permeate these countries and teach the complete opposite of egalitarianism and equality.    We aren't talking about countries like Jordan, which have very moderate Muslims who just want to live life and get along. We aren't talking about Muslims like you may meet on the London Tube or the DC Metro, who are kind and down to earth. We are talking about countries where the mainstream religious teachings are that of the stone age. And those teachings shape the cultures of these countries and the behaviors of their citizens.   I care enough about women's rights, LGBT rights, and freedom of thought and speech that I am willing to do what needs to be done to safeguard them. And sometimes that means banning certain people from entering until a better vetting process can be created.  They've spent the last two decades smuggling rocket and explosives to Hamas, which they use to fire rockets into Israeli neighborhoods and suicide bomb restaurants full of non-combatants, including children. And they've spent it developing nuclear weapons for use in threatening western countries, namely Israel.   Yes, such a noble people. It was merely behind the force which assassinated a Lebanese PM, and their Ayatollah Khomeini was the first Muslim authority to sanction modern martyrdom (aka suicide attacks). [It has.](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/09/30/the-shadow-commander) Unless you count their active material support for terrorism, which, it can be argued, led to and extended the conditions in which the US felt it necessary to bomb and invade Middle Eastern countries in the first place.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_and_state-sponsored_terrorism > bombing god knows how many others.  No, they've just had their proxy's do it. Fuck both these shit hole countries. [They must be tired from being the #1 State sponsor of terrorism.](http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/02/politics/state-department-report-terrorism/index.html)  I don't even know for a fact that they did it, but assuming they were the ones behind the 2011-2012 assassinations (as most believe), it seems likely that they had abandoned this path. He said vice versa referring to Israel banning Iranian passport holders. >At first they didnt get accapted. The white house had to fix it after they realized the fucked over thousends of people in the US and in other countrys at the same time.   Actually... no. That is referring to green card holders. Visa holders are still screwed. The UN is a joke compared to its intended purposes. >So? Western civilization was a constant threat to those countries why shouldnt they defend themselves against an anti them country just being created to fuck them over.  They could have accepted the partition plan by the UN  > Or should they have waited to be screwed over like how BP and Britain fucked Iran?  Oil spills != safe haven for the jews after WW2  >And even today Israel is still stealing land. Id be sympathetic but their government is shit. Mossad going into countries illegally and shooting a father working as a waiter because they feel hey can do whatever they want.  Ok? While this is shitty, I don't understand how it's relevant to the creation of Israel.  >Netushyna(spelling) dissing the united states president acting like he can do whatever he wants. Jews being persecuted in various parts of the world because of Israels aggression. Not to mention their presencr constantly destabalizing an entire region. Fuck em.  Actually Israel is only destabilizing Gaza strip and West Bank, not the entire region.  And that's mostly because of hamas and friends. > while Mossad enters other countries illegally and shoots working fathers  lol, is this what the Arabs have in their curricula now? Israel was created because Jews were persecuted, not the other way around. What the fuck is your point?   Jewish population was negligible prior to them being kicked out from Islamic countries and still is negligible.  And in the 1948 war about 700k+ Palestinians fled or were expelled from Israel.  edit: Or to be more precise, from what became Israel, since Israel didn't have any land before that war. My brother was born in HK in the 90's, he's British, he just cant pass it on unless he marries a British born citizen or the children are born in the uk. You mean the ruling queen always had a king as opposed to a prince like we, in the Netherlands, do? Margrethe II of Denmark is an exception here , and most of the major surviving European monarchies have abandoned male primogeniture in favor of the eldest child of the monarch being heir regardless of gender. There are a few exceptions such as the State of Vatican City where the Pope is an elected king, and some of the other smaller kingdoms and principalities.     Israeli citizenship, yes, but I was referring to Jewish ancestry. I don't know what it's like now, but in the 90s I remember immigrants having a hard time if their father was Jewish but their mother wasn't.  Well yes, but being an Israeli citizen is not the same as being a Jew.  Same way a kid born to a US citizen having a child in France is a citizen.   The Law of Return (1950) grants every Jew, wherever he may be, the right to come to Israel as an oleh (a Jew immigrating to Israel) and become an Israeli citizen.  For the purposes of this Law, ""Jew"" means a person who was born of a Jewish mother, or has converted to Judaism and is not a member of another religion.  Israeli citizenship becomes effective on the day of arrival in the country or of receipt of an oleh's certificate, whichever is later. A person may declare, within three months, that he/she does not wish to become a citizen.  An oleh's certificate may be denied to persons who:  1.engage in activity directed against the Jewish people;   2.may endanger public health or the security of the state;   3.have a criminal past, likely to endanger public welfare.  ""Since 1970, the right to immigrate under this law has been extended to include the child and the grandchild of a Jew, the spouse of a child of a Jew and the spouse of the grandchild of a Jew. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure the unity of families, where intermarriage had occurred; it does not apply to persons who had been Jews and had voluntarily changed their religion.""  It was a measure designed, in part, to ensure if a Holocaust were to happen again, Jews would have some place where they could go/would be welcome.  Vs WWII where many people were refused/turned around at ports worldwide and sent back to die. there are many many thousands of Iranian Jews it does, and mine has been expired since 2005. That still does not mean you have lost citizenship or anything like that. That's what i was told.. so in the system you are still a dual citizen, regardless of the passport being expired or not. i also wondered how they could check if i have another passport or not. But i am pretty certain if they ran any sort of check it would pop up in the system. plus, i am a brown man. whenever i show my german passport they kind of look at me like, yea right, come lets have a random checkup on your ass... ""Born in"" is apparently enough for being banned. Thank you so much. On top of all that, i have filed for my GC about two months back and paid lots of money already. I just hope things will settle soon. Bc at this point today, a GC doesn't even seem to mean much anymore. And i can't help but believe that this order was blatantly vague just to test the waters and see how far they can go with things and to shake up the administration to see who stands loyal to trump and his team and who would fight back. And those that fight back are already being replaced... It all looks so fuckin scary! But that only makes sense.  If you have sole citizenship and renounce it, you've effectively made yourself stateless.  To demand you have the protections of some nation before renouncing your French citizenship protects the individual renouncing their citizenship.  the ""lack of family ties"" is due to the fact that in France parents are ordered by the law to take care of their children until they are financially independent, moreover children are ALSO mandated to take care of their parents.    We wouldn't want a selfish prick to ditch his french nationality and move to another country just because he can't be bothered to take care of his mom About the mandatory voting, the fine is super cheap and unless you need the actual passport, don't even bother with it. I'm a Brazilian myself and I haven't voted for more than 10 years. Also, if your voting domicile is an embassy, you're only required to vote every 4 years, and you can justify with a common letter saying that you live far away. I know it shouldn't be like this but anyways, having multiple passports is a good thing. I wouldn't renounce any citizenship unless it brought much bigger issues than that. TIL, thanks for sharing ! Btw Rio is one of my favorite cities in the world, but I agree the country has some serious problems. Also there is hardly any advantage in having a Brazilian passport... Not voting is super easy tbh.  Yeah, it's interesting how tied in they are. I have friends who will go to temple with family but have no belief in what's in there. It's just part of heritage, go in, get food, hang out, go home.  Depending on the sect/practice some religions can be very 'participation not mandatory for benefits.' It's the same govt that's in charge now. You can check out any time you want, but you can never leave.  Two separate incidents. The hikers were assumed to be spies.  Those arms deals though.  honest answer: they're our ally   a shitty ally who does shitty things, but you don't ban an ally.   I remember listening to a former advisor at an oxford union talk online, and he was asked about allies such as Saudi Arabia and Israel. Sounds like they're well aware of the shitty things they do and they often violate human's rights, but he made it seem like it was more beneficial and advantageous to keep them as allies  Hell if I know.  Maybe it's because, for better or worse, Saudi Arabia is a U.S. ally.  I'm not saying they should be, but they are. You arent entitled to come to America. There is nothing to degrade. Certain liberal bubbles are being popped. Thats it.  ""Red Herring"" Or hung themselves up on the cranes. >We  You don't speak for everyone in the UK. MUSLIM TERRORISTS ARE KILLING OUR CITIZENS  MUSLIM IRAQI CITIZENS ARE COLLATERAL DAMAGE If punching someone in the face stops them from punching you in the face, then by all means. Yes, because a disputed area recently annexed, is the same as visiting a sovereign nation. Is this the first time you heard of all of this? I am not trying to be condescending but I am genuinely curious. I might have literally witnessed someone come full circle and realize what our government does around the world. If this shocks you, you gotta see what we did elsewhere. It will change your narrative forever......  I feel like, if someone had a time machine, going back in time and basically preventing the CIA from being formed would be one of the more helpful things you could do.  They only ever stir shit up. And leave messes for other people to clean up. If they can ban Jews we can ban them. After all are we not ready to battle hand in hand with our Jewish brothers? Shalom mahalem malik alli ba   For he who is not ready to cast stone shall not have stone cast upon him but the first stone cast is the last one for all  No, the argument is that the US is a shitty country for doing this. Nobody is saying the listed countries are somehow nice for doing it.   >How is banning entrance from nations with very high levels of extremism and violence morally wrong?  Can you name any incidents of extremism committed by Iranian immigrants in the US? then why is Saudi not on the ban list? Lol, and now you want to fight intolerance in a country with intolerance to people who want to get away from that country? That's a bullshit argument on a whole new level.   If culture would shape behaviors of citizens you would be tolerant and remember to judge every individual not of his place of birth or religion. Er. The Russian side in Syria seems to be the most moral one to me. Their opponents are either too weak to have a chance of winning the civil war, or terrorist fundamentalists. > Executions of men, women and children in Iran are carried out by the state  Is that really a problem? You make it seem like being diplomatically isolated and weakening the defense of your country are policies countries should pursue. Russia and Syria are allies because it protects the Iranian regime and people from invasion, and it allows Iran to project its interests.  While utterly barbaric, the last executions of homosexual men happened in 2011. Women and Children haven't been executed for this. Yeah, Iran is fucked up. But the US is responsible for the deaths of literally hundreds of thousands. Even more if you go back to the 90s and count the 500,000+ Iraqi children our sanctions killed. The amount of death and destruction we have sown in the region is orders of magnitude more than Iran has done.   Everybody can whip out Wiki articles.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_state-sponsored_terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_state-sponsored_terrorism), this state sponsored terror is what prompted Iran to activate its own proxies.  Why only triffling terror outfits, why not support genocidal dictators wholesale?  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_state-sponsored_terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_state-sponsored_terrorism) That's funny because Iran used to be a ""good"" country until...  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d'%C3%A9tat  Edit: And how did Iran create conditions ""requiring"" us to invade? Pakistan is responsible for the Taliban in Afghanistan. And who knows why the fuck we invaded Iraq. Iraq was acting as a counter-weight to Iran until we removed that part of the equation. Oil spills? Wtf are you on about. I was talking about the [1953 coup Britain instigated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat).  And no they didn't have to accept anything from the UN. Just look at the UN condemning Israel, did Israel listen? Hell nah they just threatened the UN.  http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/house-condemns-resolution-israeli-settlements-170106080417292.html  And me bringing up what Israel is doing illegally nowadays is just showing that those surrounding countries that were threatened by Israel's creation decades ago were right, just look at the Israel of today and how lawless they act, building illegal settlements, entering countries illegally and murdering their citizens.  Also Israel pissing off Muslim countries and being heavily allied with the west destabilizes the region by virtue of them being antagonists due to a long history of the west fucking with them. You don't think that doesn't destabilize is? Just look at how USA reacted to communism in South America, it made them go to war with many South American countries, same thing with Israel in a major Muslim area. Its threatening and considering Israel's actions which I stated above Iran has the right to want to protect themselves from Israel. Just like how during WW2 USA correctly questioned Japanese and German citizens. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossad#Norway  gonna ignore the truth? wow. But hey lets let Mossad just break through borders and make illegal passports because apparently speaking out against injustice isn't allowed. > When by plenty you mean more than 0, then yes.  What's your point? anyways it wasn't zero. You're wrong.  > Six hundred thousand Jews from Arab and Muslim countries had reached Israel by 1972.  Fourth paragraph in the wiki link. I meant like how female Egyptian Pharaohs were depicted as male, and there was at least one female Chinese Emperor that deliberately took ""Emperor"" as opposed to ""Empress"". That is because they were not Jewish (without formal conversion) and therefore did not have a ""birth right"" to return to Israel. Had their father been Jewish *and* an Israeli citizen, there likely would not have been a problem. > it does, and mine has been expired since 2005. That still does not mean you have lost citizenship or anything like that. That's what i was told  You are absolutely right: expired passport =/= loss of citizenship, but don't you have to pay a hefty fine if you want to travel to Iran? It would surprise me if they found out about the other passport.if they are German passport holders, they are German passport holders. Technically many of the listed countries do not have birthright citizenship so you could hypothetically have been born there but not banned. Yeah we are in for some truly tumultuous days I fear. If you ever want to vent or if you can think of something a stranger on the internet could do to help out just hit me up. That part makes sense. The problem I see is the lack of family ties in France. If the US did this, then I couldn't renounce my citizenship for as long as my brother lived unless he also renounced his citizenship. Wait, what? Who's being selfish?   Absolutely! I find Brazil to be a gorgeous place and the people are fiery and awesome! Some places in Brazil can't be beat anywhere in the world, it's a shame the government is what it is really It's an alternative country to go to if the U.S. decides it wants to go to some stupid war or something, and maybe some offshore banking but I don't know much about that.   Well by that logic it's the same US government that had a revolution that's in charge now, but the Brits don't hold that against us.   > a shitty ally who does shitty things, but you don't ban an ally.  Why not? If it's really about ""national security"" and not a transparent appeal to racism, why are Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Afghanistan not on the list?  I'm sure you're aware the majority of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi, and the last three domestic attacks (Orlando shooting, New York/New Jersey bombing and San Bernardino) were perpetrated by 1st and 2nd generation Afghan and Pakistani immigrants. Additionally, Afghanistan produces the second highest number of refugees in the world.  This whole ban seems like cutting off the nose to spite the face. We're not addressing the problem, and our president now appears bigoted.  maybe dont go destroying entire fucking cities with bombs if you want to play the "" you arent entitled"" card? Its uniquely American to not be able to draw the direct line between actions their military takes and the resulting refugee crisis, its like they are not related to you! ""Fallacy fallacy"" You are being a pedant. To Iran Israel is a disputed area too. ...go on > Shalom mahalem malik alli ba   Is that supposed to be Hebrew? There's only one legitimate word there (two if you allow for Arabic mixed with Hebrew). >If they can ban Jews we can ban them. After all are we not ready to battle hand in hand with our Jewish brothers?   Uh No?  We battle in defense of American citizens and American security.  And what kind of logic is that? We can't do stuff just because other people are doing it, have some goddamned dignity.    And since when did they ban Jews?  The Jewish minority in Iran is protected by law.  They run the biggest non-muslim charity hospital in the country and are even guaranteed a seat in parliament. - The AHA Foundation, an international women's rights and gender equality group found that there 25-28 honor killings in the United States every year. These happen when a woman or girl ""dishonors"" the family by loving who they want, disobeying male family, or being too western. This falls in line with the [DOJ's own statistics on the matter](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/06/09/honor-killings-united-nations-pakistan/85642786/). It is not specified in either report what countries the Muslims or their families originated from, but the practice of honor violence and honor killing is a part of Sharia law, a system that is overwhelmingly approved of by Iranians (I'll come back to this),  - Their government, which is viewed favorably by most Iranians (the biggest exception being millennials, but even then it isn't all of them) openly calls for the destruction of the Unites States. When they host events [like this](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/iran-marks-revolution-death-america-chants-n516406) marching by the thousands calling for Obama to be killed and the US destroyed, it's certainly cause for concern.   - According to Gallup [research](http://www.gallup.com/poll/108724/iranians-egyptians-turks-contrasting-views-sharia.aspx) 77% of Iranians believe that Sharia should be implemented as law. Remember that bit from earlier? This is concerning because Sharia is the system by which gays and lesbians are executed in Iran on a pretty regular basis, and the system that makes women nothing more than property and calls for their execution if they bring dishonor to the family. Though there are modern interpretations of Sharia these interpretations are very ""westernized"" and are rejected by conservative mainstream Islam. Which is what the vast majority of Muslims in Iran are.   I don't know about you, but I for one don't want to bring people that have a statistical likelihood of committing gender and orientation based violence. If we were talking about say, you're apartment, I don't think you'd be super down to let someone in who thinks that female gentile mutilation and domestic abuse is okay, or that gays have to executed to appease god. I especially don't think you'd be down if you had a young girl in the house or a gay roommate. And if you were okay with that I'd certainly have to question how much you really care about the girl or your roommate that you'd be willing to put them in danger to feel good about yourself.   The ban was extended to the 7 nations on the ""nations of concern"" list that President Obama put together back in 2014 (or 2015, don't quote me on year).  They aren't, the Kurds are. What do executions have to do with that? Maybe you should read yours, and then read mine, and then decide if they're at all comparable.  Iran materially assisted Al-Qaeda, to the point of evacuating hundreds of Al-Qaeda operatives immediately after the US invasion and creating an Al-Qaeda management council on Iranian soil. Al-Qaeda is a child of the ISI but Al-Qaeda got help from multiple sources.   More to the point, it was Iran's sponsorship, training, and support for terrorists that legitimized mass terrorism as a tactic for their long war against the West. While terrorism has existed for a long, long time, and much credit has to go to leftist terrorist groups of the 60s and 70s as well, Iran helped export Islamist inspired terrorism to the Western world, and were true innovators and popularizers of the concept.   I fact, I would argue that it's not too far to say that Iran is a big part of why we have a War on Terror now, as they helped spread and inspire a lot of that terror in the first place.  > gonna ignore the truth?  No, it's just the way you present it makes it sound as if Mossad has a hobby of entering countries and shooting random innocent people for no apparent reason.  > because apparently speaking out against injustice isn't allowed  You would amazed how many intelligence agencies around the globe violate international law on daily basis. Citizenship/Right of return in Israel extends to those with one Jewish Grandparent. You got that mixed up. that might be the case, i am not sure. It's been a pretty stressful few weeks, i can tell you that much. At this point i guess someone like me would have to prioritize. I would rather see my parents in germany or have them come see me. Thinking about possibly going to Iran (last time i went was 13 years ago) is so far fetched at this point, that i haven't even thought about the consequences of going there. BUt believe me when i say, its tough! My grandma is turning older and older and god knows if i ever get to see her again before its too late.. they will ask you on the borders if you hold different passports. Not sure what happens if someone was to lie and say no... i browse reddit a lot but havent discovered all features of it yet. just clicked on some ""friend"" button. I hope somehow you will remain in sight. Always appreciate good conversations and support. Cheers  and the next 10 years will not be fun for anyone, much like what Argentina went through. It's a shame That is true but honestly with an American passport you can pretty much stay indefinitely in Brazil, I love the country but the government and bureaucracy are very lame I'm well aware Saudi Arabia is a top exporter of terrorists and Salafism, I was just giving the other guy the explanation that politicians have used in the past.   I honestly have no clue why the 7 countries are banned for 90 days. But I do know the Obama administration had a list with those 7 countries deemed ""unsafe and unstable"" The former is a real thing. The latter is a troll's inability to come up with a witty response. Yeah the only bright spot in the whole conflict is Rohava. I hope those guys end up with their own state or at least autonomy. Please tell me, what arbitrary rule do you apply here? ""Freedom meter"" or something perhaps? It was the US' sponsorship of vile dictators like the Shah and Saddam who later unleashed 8 years of warfare on Iran that prompted Iran to undertake assymetrical warfare.  Also, Islamic terrorism REALLY took off after Op Cyclone winded down, thanks to Americans funding (via the ISI and GID) Islamic Nutjobs like Gulbudin Hekmatiyar. And those agencies should also be condemned for it along with Mossad. I actually also have a grandmother from my father's side all alone in Russia. It pains me to know that her last moments will be very lonely. We try to visit her from time to time and call her regularly through Skype, but even that can't fight the loneliness.  I would really recommend to you to renew your passport. Having expired documents can hurt you in the long run.  It might sound materialistic, but you also have to think of the inheritance of your grandmother. Someone will have to probably retrieve it.  In any case I wish you and your family the best. Well it's temporary, right? Can't you just wait 3 months? I mean you haven't been to Iran in 13 years or seen your parents for the last 3 and now it's a pressing issue that you can't go today? Maybe I'm just missing something...   Edit: I know I'll be down voted for asking this, but I genuinely want to know. Interesting. You can't do that with the Russian passport. You'll definitely get fined if you try to travel with that to Russia. I used to hold 2 passports, ive never been asked if I hold more than one on entering any country and have travelled fairly extensively. > with an American passport you can pretty much stay indefinitely in Brazil  Really? I thought American citizens needed a visa to enter Brazil.  SOURCE: https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/brazil.html I get what you're saying, but here's what I'm saying:  If the omission of these countries is political,  the ban itself has strained these political relations anyway,  because now the president appears bigoted.  Nah, I'm pretty sure that both replies are shitty. If you have to rely on fallacies to try to make your point you really have nothing to offer.    Also, here's proof it's a real thing.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_fallacy    You realize if you didn't know what it was you could've just google it, right? Hang on, you think the ISI funded Hekmatiyar *on the US's orders?* I hadn't heard that one before. Got anything I can read further?  > where they straight up just made a habit of entering countries and assassinating people  Who were these people? Again, are these just random people? Heard about the Munich massacre?  > they should respect those countries governments  There's a tremendous respect for these countries. That's why Israel did the job of assassinating criminals. After all, these countries did almost nothing to bring the criminals of Munich to justice. appreciate your kind words! A lot of people do not seem convinced that it will actually be temporary... Quite easy to renew every three months if people are getting used to it. True but when you spend months of planning filed your vacations and made travel arrangments it's pretty awful. And I'm just giving an example of how I specifically was affected. There's people currently that I know who are much worse off. Persons that traveled to Iran to visit family well before the order was signed and now are stuck for 3 months? Who will pay their rent? Lost wages? Other expenses.. yea me personally I'll be fine. But some others not so much i have definitely been asked before. And every time i enter the US (ONLY the US, no problems anywhere else) i do end up in the deep lower level end of the airport where i get to spend at least a couple hours for them to run me through their system. This is especially fun when you have connecting flights... Oh let me amend that. You definitely need a Visa, but it's very easy to get one and keep it renewed if you have money Not directly, which is why I added the *via ISI and GID* - analysts in State and the CIA constantly argued against giving Pakistan and Saudi Arabia a free hand, non audited, no questions asked carte blanche, but the US politicial leadership didn't care.  The result was that almost 80% of the funding and arms (iirc Hekmatiyar and the nutjobs got 300 stingers while Massoud got 3) went to the Islamic nutjobs.   http://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-pushing-israel-to-stop-assassinating-iranian-nuclear-scientists/\  Scientists are now criminals.

"17",16,"5r6ier","2017-01-31","It would be nice if people would stop being distracted by the shiney shiney.  Trumps policies are madness but it's not our country.  UK population should be more worried by the multiple  laws slipped under the radar while they've been distracted by Trump.  May just took away our entire right to privacy, any government agency (all the way down to Food Standards Agency) is allowed to go through every one of your emails/texts/phone records etc. without a warrant and the new law is basically an open ended warrant on all of us.  No one is saying shit.  Theresa May is trying to bin the human rights act, no one is talking about it.  Trump is a very convenient distraction for the international community.  While all these people are holding protests against Trump (which is slightly ironic they want to ban him from the country in protest of him banning people from America) the Tories are running rampant. Can she really say no?   Just trying to look at things realistically here. She's having a dialogue with him, she's not agreeing with all or even ANY of his decisions by default.   She might very well strongly believe that he's a complete asshat, but part of her job is to talk to the biggest asshats in the world when those asshats are the leaders of an allied insanely strong military complex and an economic powerhouse.   [Here's a perfect example - sometimes ya gotta talk to distasteful people.](http://ww2today.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/churchill-roosevelt-stalin-at-Yalta.jpg) Yet these people have no issues with the Chinese premier visiting or Saudi officials... We can't snub the people we're desperate to get good trading relations with, and certainly not because they have a temporary ban on travel from some pretty dodgey parts of the world. End of the day it's their border and they can let in or keep out whoever the fuck they like.  People like Trump dig in when you try to tell them how it is, the opinionated can be manipulated by gentle influence or further entrenched by backlash. And like it or not, he's the president right now. Its very easy for us to say we hate trump (and trust me i do) and we don't want we don't want him here (i really don't) but the job of the PM is to do whats best for the country not make decisions based on personal bias. Whether your a brexiter or not you have to agree the UK is on a tipping point and while I think we can be successful with brexit we could easily fuck it up and pissing of a powerful potential alley is a good way to start.  It may seem like a simple moral choice but we could be feeling the repercussions of this for years to come.     I don't know what I would do in her position. On one hand we need to be his friend but on the other....fuck that guy. If only they had done this sort protests on shit like snoopers charter. UK politics is as rotten and as much of a joke, yet they are all obsessed over the president of another country, sometimes just want to give up on this place, put on a Tory hat, and laugh at people getting what they deserve for their utter apathy.  You don't close doors on world leaders. You leave them open for elected leaders to personally visit each other for sit down  in depth discussion when the media is out of sight.  That is how treaties, or other agendas are met. Do you not think what it would have been like if Jimmy Carter closed the door to Anwar Sadat? There would be no peace treaty between Israel and Eygpt.  Now how is Prince Charles supposed to have one on one with Trump over climate change policies? shame on may for what?  american domestic policies are fuck all to do with us. Are these the same people who want us to have a second referendum? Their the only type of people who lack common sense who act like toddlers having a tantrum because they can't get their own way. Brexit requires us to make new trade agreements and by showing the EU that we can get a better deal with the US they will offer us a better deal because everyone, EVERYONE does business through the UK and the EU needs the UK to do business with the US, they don't like the rest of the EU. This is nothing new, as it's been the same before obama and bush. It's only the stupid ones screaming loudest being manipulated by the politicians with hidden agendas. ""The people chanting shame are never the good guys""-Ben Shapiro There are some interesting things to note from this in my opinion.  The left is now so obsessed with doing 'the right thing' morally that it's ignoring completely the outcomes of the act they demand. this is a complete contradiction of the intellect people at the left seem to think they have.  The next and possibly worse thing is that people in the UK seem to care so much about trump - this suggests our important topics are being guided globally - a good thing in itself, if it wasn't the outcome of some random facebook algorithm trying to make us log in more. we're being pushed into a nice little bubble of ignorance and it seems people are already too detached to get out. I'll welcome Mr. President into our country, such a great bloke. He can pop round for some tea & a natter.  Why are they not shaming the Muslim countries who has banned Israel from traveling there. The Left has completely lost their minds with this ""LITERALLY HITLER"" narrative they've created.  This is going to get Trump re-elected. Guaranteed. Had Cameron had 1/2 of the cojones May has, we wouldn't been in this mess right now.  But it's only January why do they already hate may?  This whole Trump hating trend is so retarded. I live in a central European country, that's doing well for itself, and I've seen graffiti saying ""Trump = Hitler"". Activism is becoming such a joke. Opening trade talks by letting the other person know you think they are twat isn't a smart move either. May can let him know she doesn't agree but preferably do her job and look after the people she's actually responsible for. People can pretend it's about morals but no one is actually suggesting not meeting and doing business with the guy. Queen should have earn her keep anyway, I'm sure Philip will be able to say something to put Trump in a good mood.  I've said this before, but they wont withdraw the invitation. To do so would be considered an insult, and would likely cause a diplomatic incident. Maintaining a good relationship with the US is more important than appeasing a bunch of petition signers. Sorry, but thats just the way it is. I think May needs to sort out her stance on populism. because it seems to me the masses opinion only matters when they agree with her policies And millions support her.  They're working. They do this but not the snoopers chart? The fuck is wrong with this country? He is literally not your president. Go home. Theresa the appeaser.  Did these people in the UK protest when their government passed a law allowing themselves to view all of their citizen's [internet history](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/investigatory-powers-act-liberty-legal-challenge-high-court-opposition-a7518136.html)? I would guess not. These people don't know why they are protesting. I guess the DNC should not have nominated Hillary... This is the compassionate left? Why not talk to your enemy? What does even the nutty ass suggestion of banning the person in charge of the country that subsides Europe's defense, actually do?   Everyone has lost their fucking minds. How can things get better if we don't at least try to work together these people will have something to really protest about if the UK abandons both europe and america simultaneously and has no leverage and becomes isolated and enters a great recession  then you will have non-liberal protesters, and they wont be peaceful with cute signs  liberals are conforming to an idealized philosophy versus reality, and thats why they are losing in europe and america with real issues What's the point? If we are going to Brexit then we must suck up to Trump. End of story. Period.  I don't want to Brexit, but it's going to happen now and we are going to need all the help we can get. Telling Trump to fuck off is just shooting ourselves in the foot. As tempting as it is, we will regret it. Who is the owner of the guardian? The editor?   well thats a big fucking surprise They would probably be cool with her talking to the trurkish president though... Dumbasses     >What has Trump done yet that you people feel the need to protest?  Well at least people can stop asking that stupid question. For disclosure sake, I was born in the UK 40ish years ago, voted to Remain in EU   We have voted to leave the EU, and it seems the conservatives are still afraid of UKIP so we're also leaving the single market which kind of ties her hands and means she'll want to make as many friends outside the EU as soon as possible (such as future dictatorship Turkey) ready for trade deals. I don't like it but it's the right thing in the circumstance, even though in a couple of years it means we'll be eating chlorinated chicken, growth hormones cows, and GM food which won't be labelled as such....     Shutting up as the whole future of things feels so depressing, but maybe in the future people will think about what repercussions voting has, maybe even not just believe what the Media (I find it hard to call it News now) and Facebook says These people are crazy. You're about to leave the EU and a trade deal with the US is about the most important thing you need right now. And you want to protest trump meeting the queen? You fucking kidding me?  We saw how much good that did when they started chanting ""shame"" at electors. Personally I don't think 'thousands' is a large enough number to be taken seriously. I don't really care about most of this (doesn't mean I don't agree with Trumps stance btw) but at the end of the day, this proves once and for all that May is not a leader.  She does what she wants and will beat her opposition into submission so she can, there is no compromise.  The Queen mingles with the Saudis, so she has set herself extremely low standards.   Protesting against the government is counter-productive; peaceful disobedience and non-compliance is the only way to defeat the system.  By the way, the International Common Law Court of Justice issued an arrest warrant for the queen four years ago. Anyone got the minerals to carry it out...?  So.. Do they just want England to be isolated from America as long as Trump is president?  Lets be honest, I dont think any protest will stop Trump from coming to the UK, May will gladly welcome him... Protest or no protest... many people will be there to welcome Trump and He will tweet as usual How many protesters voted for Brexit? only white ppl are held to this high standard by the left. Do they not understand the word Tyrant.  Hillary Clinton is the very definition of a tyrant where laws do not apply to her. Show me a law Trump has broken that he has not been charged with.  Anyone that thinks it's a better idea to just not talk to Trump as opposed to actually accepting that he is the president of the United States and doing everything to deal with the situation at hand is an idiot. I'm guessing these are not the people who voted for Brexit.  The biggest form of being a crybaby/sore loser has crossed the ocean.  The liberal left has truly shown what a sore loser looks like. It's funny - You'd think all of the xenophobic fucks who voted for the Brexit would welcome him with open arms.   Oh, wait, they're all old bastards who fucked over your country, and are too feeble to go greet him.   The Brexit, and The Donald - Two absolute embarrassments.  It's almost like the left has had decades of time to perfect the art of whining about inconsequential issues and expecting to be taken seriously on issues they have no business in.  Fuck em, May's doing exactly what she should be doing - disregarding a spoiled, whiny vocal minority. Wonder where all those people were when Mugabe visited .. or when Thatcher visited Pinochet and thanked him for overthrowing a democratic government and installing a reign of terror.  It's a TEMPORARY restriction while they arrange for a more suitable vetting process. You don't fix a leaking tap without turning off the water. People need to calm the fuck down. So the last six presidents in office have limited immigration in some form, even Obama. So now that Trump is in office this suddenly becomes a huge deal? Nothing illegal has been done and it has been done before.   Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 states: Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. [Love the way The Scotts say stuff. ](http://i.imgur.com/sDssoP4.jpg) Why would she listen to these protesters? They do not speak for the majority of the British people.  [Word cloud out of all the comments.](http://i.imgur.com/O3ObYJq.png)  I hope you like it If only people did this about the EU ref.  Not surprising really. She is conservative. As Home Secretary, she was keen to enforce her own potentially damaging immigration reforms: https://www.google.com/amp/www.independent.co.uk/voices/theresa-mays-rules-on-immigration-are-a-disturbing-sign-of-the-country-wed-become-under-her-a7119436.html%3famp That's just one example of her hard-line stance.  Also as we begin the painful divorce proceedings from our European cousins, she will not jeapordise her relationship with the UK's new benefactor by condemning Trump's destructive immigration ban.   She is happy to become his subservient for the benefit of the UK economy. Although this stance, coupled with the unknown fallout from severing ties with EU, may back fire and prematurely derail her tenure as Prime Minister.   The US secret service must be shitting themselves at the thought of ferrying this clown around the World....safely! lol. Tbh, it's kinda for the best that Trump visits, because you don't wanna offend him or he might build a wall around the UK and get us to pay for it!! What's happening now with Trump is a travesty, but holy shit do I get excited by the overwhelming defiance of his positions!  So many people are pushing back, it's really inspiring!  I hope it's enough to defeat his ideology. May is doing what's best for her country even if the citizens are being overly emotional at the moment. If you're going to leave the EU you have to start setting up trade deals. Trump will not be president forever, so it's important this gets done.   Takes balls as a leader to do what's best even if people are pissed about it.  Fuck, man, at least she's addressing the protests instead of pretending like they're not happening/happening for the reason that they are. Yeah. Thousands. I heard there was 40 in Swindon last night.  Nobody cares. That petition is nothing but bots. Nobody has even bothered to ask the queen if she gives a shit. This'll all be forgotten by February 20th. I don't understand. People expect her to just never meet with Trump? The UK'S leader and the US' just won't meet for the next 4 years? Seems like an unreasonable thing to expect. Plenty of bad things in our own country they could and probably should be protesting about before protesting a visit from a foreign leader.  God damn the left is hateful lately. Well only hateful against white people. Other races can do whatever the please without recourse from the left.  I want to knoooooww why you're such a cunt!  Thank you to our UK brothers and sisters for standing up for humanity. External pressure is going to be critical to not only check Trump, but to make it clear to leadership around the world that this conduct is unacceptable. Trump is the president of the most powerful country in the world.  What are these retarded mongrels whining about? You do *not* want to get on the United States' bad side, or else the UK will continue the toxic relationship with the US that Obama started. It's not in their best interests to sever political ties because some whiny cunts disagree on Trump's immigration policy. Can you imagine being so retarded that you want to ban the leader of one of the greatest world-powers?  I wonder how these people don't drown in their own drool. Proud of Theresa May standing strong on what is better for her people, whether it is liked or not. We're seeing a global movement to attack extreme hypocrisy and prejudice now? May has possibly been the worst PM yet. She's thrown away our digital privacy, our human rights act and now is buddying up with Trump. Absolutely shame on her. Yes leave the EU then try to shame your PM for trying to set up trade deals for your country. Your people voted to exit. Absolute fucking idiots.  (UK here) By voting Brexit it means that we need to strengthen our relationships. Without existing trade deals in place with the EU and if we broke ties with the USA, we'd be / gonna be fucked. I know they were out protesting on Obama when he banned Cubans from coming to our shores.  I'll wait while you find that source.   PS protest your own country, we left you, you didn't leave us. So, if you disagree with someone, ban them from your country?  Sounds a bit hypocritical, eh? When we (America) end up either starting WW3 or goto war with a non Arab country, will the other country know that most of the citizens of America had nothing to do with going to war? Or just go all out and destroy us? Let's be honest, Trump has proven that he can do what he wants as a nation's leader despite what his people want, and other nation's leaders are likely to follow suit very soon. > Earlier, Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, warned MPs not to demonise Trump or compare him to Adolf Hitler in a statement on the escalating row.  You know, if you have to actually *tell* MPs not to compare a guy to Hitler, maybe the MPs aren't the problem. They just Brexited and need a trade deal to cover their asses from the fallout. They're not going to do anything. Let's be honest. He will come over regardless, there will be protests and Trump will tweet  ""Biggest crowds to welcome the US President ever""  The quality of leadership in several first world countries has completely turned to shit.  Here are two prime examples... there are more on the way and in the making. There are competing petitions going in England: 1.6 million DON'T want President Pussygrabber in their country, only 90,000 do. Of course, 3 million of those who signed the anti-Trump petition are illegal aliens...  Meanwhile I'm sitting here in Northern Ireland, with absolutely no say in any of these matters - even though all of them will affect me as part of the UK.  We voted overwhelmingly to stay in the EU, but now we are pretty much living in Orwell's 1984 - and now May is threatening to scrap the human rights act that the EU enforces.  This is a bloody joke, Shame on May is right. The left has become the party of hate. This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/30/theresa-may-donald-trump-state-visit-protests-uk-parliament) reduced by 90%. (I'm a bot) ***** > Theresa May defended the decision to invite Donald Trump on a state visit as thousands of protesters took to the streets across the UK and more than 1.5 million people signed a petition to try to stop the trip from going ahead. The prime minister made the briefest of responses to the domestic uproar over the US president&#039;s attempt to ban travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries, insisting that the &quot;UK takes a different approach&quot;.  > &quot;I have issued that invitation for a state visit for President Trump to the United Kingdom and that invitation stands.""  > The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, wrote to the prime minister to urge her to listen to more than a million Britons who had called on her to cancel the state visit, in which Trump could address both houses of parliament.   ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/5r6ses/theresa_may_stands_firm_on_trumps_state_visit_as/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~55978 tl;drs so far."") | [Theory](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31bfht/theory_autotldr_concept/) | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **Trump**^#1 **ban**^#2 **Johnson**^#3 **order**^#4 **country**^#5 I think the way its currently going will work out. After leaving the EU the uk will need to secure a good trade deal with a country like america, and thats what she can do. However the mass protesting and opposition from the public should show the rest of the world that the UK is as opposed to trump as anywhere else.   Hes an idiot but hes an idiot that they need something from. So May takes the blame and the UK is better of for it. The UK just voted itself out of its closest relationship. We need friends. This is the government. You elected us. We serve you.  Well, she might give him a damn good whapping with her purse. Stricter security laws, no one bats an eye. Donald Trump comes to visit, all hell breaks loose?  Edit: if you hate trump so much just give him the Saudi king treatment! Play the imperial March as he exits his plane! 'Let them eat cake' I doubt any British politician from any party in power would be ddumb enough to antagonize the POTUS. Those thousands of protestors are ultimately a minority. If the UK had fresh elections tomorrow Theresa May would be back with an overwhelming lead. We marched in the millions against war and the crooks didn't listen.  A few hundred thousand was never going to do anything. she reminds me alot of Blair, only more useless. I wish saying, ""shame on _______ "" actually made them have shame. Seems impossible.  I love the foreign office comment ""...Zimbabwes Robert Mugabe and Romanias Nicolae Ceauescu...""    That's a non-to-subtle on their opinion of Trump as a leader.     Shaaaaame on Maaaaayyyy wash your worries awaaaaaaayyy Just to be clear this is about him coming over on a state visit, staying with the queen etc. I assume he could come over and meet May without all that? The protest isn't to prevent Teresa May meeting with Trump to discuss trade and minutiae of politics.  It's to prevent the occasion from being an official state visit, which involves the visiting party meeting the spiritual and moral leader of the realm Her Majesty The Queen. In British culture this is a great honour with a resplendent display of pomp and ceremony. Iran should give Trump honorary citizenship.  Trump tries to return to the US and then ""Sorry, Mr. President. You have dual citizenship with Iran. We're going to have to deport you."" There will be protests come what may When 'we' voted for Brexit he tweeted ""Scotland are partying in the streets!""  When, in reality, Scotland were all ""YA WHA MATE GET TAY FUCK YA BREXITIN BASTARDS!""  He's full of shit. Hahaha yeah pretty much.  Above average comment.  Indeed.  The long and short of it is, they couldn't care less about what the people think. Yup. He'll come. And then she'll go, in the next election.  Whether it makes a difference or not, it's important to stand up and be counted. To be silent is to say 'This is OK' to what is happening. I'm sorry for this idiot. I assure you I took no part in his election. Sorry he will eventually sully your streets with his presence. Didn't May say that they're scrapping the new UK Bill o' Rights?  Spot on point. Thousands out protesting over a foreign leader while at home in the UK these laws are being passed without so much as a whimper from anybody, apart from some rights groups but nobody cares enough to do anything. It's like hivemind mentallity over Trumps every move. They're also quietly reducing funding to the nhs and social services more and more so they can claim that it needs privatisation. Conveniently many of the Tories including ~~Cunt~~ Hunt have direct links to private healthcare services Oh my god this! I'm as enraged about Trump's behaviour as the next man but meanwhile, back at the ranch; dear old T and her cronies continue to just drive a steamroller over disabled people and vulnerable people, purposely under-fund the NHS to destabilise it so they can start to sell an insurance based system as the way forward, have an information gathering program the Nazi SS would be envious of... Prostituting herself to the new US President for a desperate trade deal but forgetting that he's shown to be very anti-free trade so would screw us and all to save face over a hard Brexit. The list could go on and on and on...  Where the fuck is everyone with their anger and their placards at our own Government screwing us over on a daily basis?  I love that people were out in the masses to defend against the wholesale hate that Trump is pushing towards Muslim people. But once that's done can be not forget that our own government are fucking us over too? Jesus. Exactly right. It feels like the news in UK the has become the Donald Trump show and none of these horrible Tory policies have received significant coverage.  Yeah too many people care about Trump's every move. Bear in mind the US runs it's largest (external) NSA listening station from RAF Menwith Hill (Yorkshire), which has been capturing all the information May has just made it legal to for years.   If you give a shit about human rights, privacy, and the rule of law, you need to keep an eye on both our government and our imperial masters from across the pond. May could retract the snoopers charter tomorrow, Trump would still have access to all the information you want kept private. Not to mention that you need a utility bill and passport now to register with a GP in the name of public security. Some very ugly things happening in the UK right now, and our government has always been very sly and subtle, very much different from the USA. I could almost believe it's a tandem act. Especially when Farage left the UK to hang out with Trump, I had a very weird feeling. I want to leave as soon as possible. Many people where I live are in support of Trump and the upsurge of fascism... I am an alien here. well, there haven't been any protests about that. Or even any politicians trying to stop it, it seems Welcome to politics in the internet age.  The same thing is happening here in Canada.  We have some serious issues, including outrageous electricity costs in Ontario and a housing crisis yet we can't even get people to show up to a protest for our own issues unless it involves a perceived slight against human rights.  But Trump becomes President and suddenly everyone loses their minds. Thousands of Canadian women poured into Washington to protest. Then they protested the US Consulate in Toronto again this week.  He's not President of the world. Fucking wake up and look at your own country people. I know Churchill was a drunk but he wasn't that bad. The petition is to not make it a state visit. That's not the same as not taking.  I mean, how ""morally upright"" do you have to be for a state visit to be out of the question? Trump may be an orange moron but that doesn't make him Kim Jong-Un. May has already met with Erdogan and he does worse stuff than Trump all the time.  Which one in that picture is supposed to be the tasteful one? Would be like shooting ourselves in the foot to cancel at this point. We're not in a particularly strong position as it is. This is the problem, if these protesters were smart enough to think about what they're asking (not dealing with people with offensive or oppressive views) then we'd be in a frigging oil crisis in the UK since holding the oil gulf states by the standards trump is held to would have us need to cut off ties and slash off our nose to spite our face. I understand there desire to put pressure on him but like you said, having a meeting with trump and relying on standard diplomacy to try and ease him off over time is a better option than isolating and annoying trump so he gets pushed further towards aggressing issues further.  > She might very well strongly believe that he's a complete asshat  She might, but she probably doesn't. [They likely have a lot in common, in terms of policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5r0066/one_million_sign_petition_to_stop_trump_uk_visit/dd3sfmj/).   In terms of personality, as the the daughter of a vicar, churchgoing and married since 1980, and to all appearances living a modest and reserved lifestyle,  she might well find him objectionable. While obviously the current states of China and Saudi Arabia are worse than the current state of the US, there's something to be said for administrations that are improving their country year by year (China) and at least not actively making things worse than they were before (Saudi Arabia). It's a shame we have to whore ourselves out to such despots like Trump and Erdogan for trade scraps now though. If all evidence is to be believed it'll come at a heavy cost such as further NHS privatisation. >On one hand we need to be his friend but on the other....fuck that guy.  Business as usual... I guess.  This.   As distasteful as Trump is, he's the president of the most powerful country in the world. And that means the rest of the world has to deal with him like it or not.    If we weren't leaving the EU we could take a much tougher line with him.  This whole debate shows that how vulnerable Brexit has made the UK. There were. Got a lot less press coverage though.  I hate these statements, ""oh why didn't they protest x,y,z"" when the answer is usually that they have and had done for years but the person asking the question didn't care enough at the time to take notice and doesn't care enough now to do a simple bloody Google search.  US politics ruined this website... There is not even a discussion going on, it's just two equally retarded sides hurling insults at each other.  I naively thought that the shitposting and propaganda would stop when the election was over, I was very wrong...   I now see the genius of a two party system, the people will always be divided, the politicians don't even have to lift a finger. They do what they want while the people fight each other.  It isn't as simple as ""a president of another country""  There's a reason thousands of people are protesting against him. People want to show that despite the harsh conditions he's putting on international relations and equal rights, we still stand together for something.  The president of the USA affects a lot more people.  Because this is pure virtue signalling. It's trendy on social media and many mainstream outlets to simply...hate Trump.  It's people in the first world screaming ""I'M A REALLY GOOD PERSON!!!""  > If only they had done this sort protests on shit like snoopers charter  We did. However never in history has a US president been invited to a state visit in their first year in office, let alone their first week! The Royal family doesn't have discussion on policy or treaties or law at all. That's done with the Government which stopping a state visit doesn't effect in any way shape or form. It is merely ceremonial and more of a promotional opportunity for both sides and general good will between heads of state. Hence it being a state visit.    The Royals have very strict guidelines on the shit they can say in public and to others to avoid conflict of interest with the Government.   Where are you getting your information? Afaik Trump requires/demands that Charles is not present when he visits As much as I disagree with Trumps climate change policies I'd rather not have the future monarch weighing in publicly (conversation might be private but the intended content is being reported publicly) on a political debate  The President of Mexico is going to realize this soon.  Seems many people don't get that.  Sometimes people care about things that affect other people. Shocker, I know. For sure the msm and other advertisement driven companies love what trump is doing. He''s bringing lots of pageviews and clicks. Hating Donald trump doesn't mean you're on the left. It means you read the news. hear hear! Because it's politically incorrect.  Unfortunately, that's how the world works right now.... That's not how we do things here.  We only have so much energy to utilize before outrage fatigue sets in, and our desire to have our outrage validated by others puts us in the position of seeking echo chambers.  Therefore, we choose to be outraged at a western nation, particularly when it appears that the majority of people are unhappy about the POTUS.  It's conservation of Anger-energy.  Angergy?  Pretty sure it's a law. This is what got him in the White House in the first place. It's the loud minority at work again. What exactly could Cameron have done?   He resigned before Trump was even president 1/2 of 0 is 0 you wont get anywhere flinging insults around That's the exact opposite of what happened. None of the republicans had the spine to take him on directly, so he just kept getting more aggressive and popular.   Forget about controlling or appeasing him.  Time to decide what values you're willing to stand for.  Bored youth regurgitate whatever bullshit media presents.  You should live in the US. If anything, this election has pushed me farther right. I was registered as a nonpartisan, but now I'm thinking of becoming a Republican because I'm fed up with the idiocy of the left.  Yeah, how dare she distinguish between populism and a referendum. Sounds like a sorceress name or something. There is a difference between appeasement and normal diplomacy though, clearly meeting with someone we are actively looking to get a trade deal with so in talks with to progress and improve relations is normal diplomacy. Appeasing Hitler when he was trying to attack or take over countries and gas jews is a bit of a poor comparison to speaking with people we don't like otherwise Obama had been appeasing the Saudi's for years and is just as bad. You can't break the cycle of normal diplomatic protocol everytime someone does soemthing you don't want or we'd not be diplomatically speaking to anyone to be honest. No more Turkey after the purge, no more china after the south china sea / oppression of it's smaller regions like tibet, no more France or UK for our libya / iraq disasters, no more America for trying to push terrorists in Syria (regardless of whether they felt it would overthrow Assad, it prolonged battles with jihadi's hurting innocents) blah blah blah and it goes on. Diplomatic relations are best served without getting too far on the high horse if you're not willing to stretch the same standards equally to all countries and we've never done that with the gulf states.  That wasnt cool enough.  And I am not joking. It's actually such bullshit, most people I've mentioned it to have said ""so what? I have nothing to hide"". Not to mention most of the labour party, the MAIN OPPOSITION, abstained from the vote for the bill.  It was her turn  I guess Americans shouldn't be uneducated easily fooled fucking morons You are implying that the left had minds to lose. They are so open minded their minds fell out long ago.  Not inviting him for a state visit and banning him aren't the same. The original partition even called for a heads of government visit instead of a state visit which really can't be compared to a ban. Pretty much identical except the Queen wouldn't have to meet him. UK and US has always had a special relationship though. Why should they throw that away now? Even without Brexit, Thersea should strive for a good relationship with Trump. It's owned by the Scott Trust.  Why are people more outraged about Trump not allowing people from seven countries, then about Obama bombing them? Oh no, evil GM food...   now tell me what exactly is wrong with it? Are there any countries without outrage culture left in Europe, except Poland, Hungary, Czech and (maybe) Slovakia? It's genuinely making me depressed. This mindless antagonism to pretty reasonable policy. I remember being disgusted at conservatives back in the early Obama days. Now that the left has proven to be even more insane I just feel hopeless for the world.  I hope you realise the left was in government as recently as 7 years ago. I know the Conservatives have been in power for a while but not for decades like you said. **Silent Majority Quietly Approves of Prime Minister's Stance**   To be fair, this makes a piss poor headline. I'm not surprised they went with the protesters.  I mean, a lot of people weren't around when thatcher did that... It's sad to see people with your view. We all know a country like Zimbabwe is a lost cause. Yet you need someone like Mugabe to justify the current direction of the UK. People care because there is real reason to worry for the UK. Suddenly it's not a dysfunctional foreign country that moves towards the extreme. This time it's the UK. Yeah, exactly. If you close the doors, how do we discuss anything? How do we move forward?  We let these leaders in so we can talk and share our views and try come to resolutions over time. Rome wasnt built in a day or whatever They won't. People are so determined for Trump to be the devil that they won't give anything he does a chance. It will all be the end of the world. Likewise his supporters are so determined for him to be Jesus they will never vocalize disagreement with him. And nobody will have an open dialogue about their beliefs because all anybody on either side wants to do is throw insults at each other because OH MY GOD HOW CAM SOMEONE POSSIBLY HAVE A DIFFERENT FUCKING VIEWPOINT THAN ME!?!?!? > So the last six presidents in office have limited immigration in some form, even Obama.  There is a diffirence, Obama was only bombing them, while Trump has not allowed them in US, and only one of those things deserve outrage. Or Americans signing it... Well, a lot of people over there just don't want a racist, sexist, fascist cuntwaffle like Trump soiling their country.  However, what *most* people are opposing is a *state visit,* which is a formal one where he meets with the Queen. No US president in history has made a state visit to the UK so soon in their term. The Queen kinda stays out of politics, and for her to meet with such a politically-charged head of state so soon after assuming office would be bad form.  And of course, PM May has already been over here.  It has nothing to do with meeting Trump. Meeting trump **is not** the problem. The fact is, it's a State Visit which is the highest honor the UK government bestows on foriegn leaders. It took Obama 3 years to get one, most presidents don't get any.    There'a  **vast** difference between a visit relating to state matters, and a ""state visit"" that is essentially just used to show the world how much you love and respect the other leader.   Well... It is the only thing left to her people after they pulled a Trump on her. If the US is not going to have some sort of arrangement with GB, the land will die an economic death. Oh like the Muslim ban! (Yeah I am pointing out the obvious.) Did you read the story?   Nobody is talking about banning him, we shouldn't be rolling out the red carpet for him.  You know the vast majority of Americans support the immigration policy changes, right? We must be tolerant of everyone. Unless they disagree.... Because all the media is against him.  Obama bombed those countries, and noone says anything.  Yet an 6 month immigration ban is what makes everyone lose their minds.   It's crazy. That's why they held it in the evening.   Plus there's the thought that if you moved by an issue to the point where you were willing to protest, being a bit tired for work the next day doesn't seem like a strong enough reason to not bother. If the Queen snubs him, it'll likely be one of the most controversial moves in politics for a very long time. I've got no idea what the impacts would be.  ""Your Majesty, the peasants are revolting!""  Yes. They are, aren't they? Pull!"" Well, if he's already refusing to meet Charles, who knows what could happen. If someone told my mam they wanted to meet her but I could go fuck myself, she wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet and the royals tend to take personal slights more seriously than us plebs. It's Theresa May. [This is Teresa May]( https://twitter.com/RealTeresaMay) Also, one of the issues is that this is a fast-track appointment. World leaders don't meet the Queen this soon after getting in power. Traditionally they wait around a year so that the Queen can see what kind of a leader they are and how to communicate with them. She has met dictators before and all kinds of shady characters. But she did it on her own terms. I'm struggling to see how this would change anything. Her Maj has spent her entire reign meeting despots at the behest of our governments. If anything, her experience might be what is needed: Trump is an Anglophile and this would be a huge deal for him personally.  In those circumstances she might be a positive influence, however small that is. The thing is, the majority of the Left don't even support the monarchy and believe the Royal family to be ""a waste of taxpayer money"". These protests are all a show because they don't agree with President Trump's policies.   We found the answer reddit!  ... that's not how it works. I appreciate the colloquial twang there Did I miss a vote?  From what I see you have a desperate vocal minority protesting Trump's visit.  Hardly the voice of the people. Yes, due to Brexit.  It was being put on hold because of the referendum, officially anyway.  My suspicion is, now that Brexit is through, the EU has far less clout to stop the Tories turning the country fully into the book 1984.  So yes she said she was scrapping the Bill of Rights but with my cynical hat on, means to me scrapping the Bill of Rights the EU had input into, not scrapping the idea.  They'll probably just do a new draught removing even more rights. And people think our governments don't know what the fuck they're doing... Those English buggers better stop voting for them. Like seriously.  > he's shown to be very anti-free trade     While I agree with most of your points, this trope really needs to end. Let's look at this objectively: Trump has made himself out to be the best dealmaker in the world, while TM has said repeatedly that if we can't get a good deal from the EU, we'll walk away with no deal - and I genuinely believe her based on her past.    So with the above in mind, both parties are pretty eager to conclude a deal, especially Trump who needs to get a quick ""win"" to shore up his legitimacy as ""dealmaker-in-chief"", and May to shore up her negotiating hand with the EU. However, the big stumbling block to the trope that Britain is ""going to get fucked over by a Trump admin with a trade deal"" is antithetical to everything I've said above, because:     1) It would be a huge embarrassment for the Trump admin if they couldn't conclude a quick, mutually favorable deal with Britain (a white, middle class, christian country that literally spawned the American legal system, and won't compete for American manufacturing jobs, has similar regulatory policies, and is America's greatest geopolitical partner) and would make a lot of his supporters scratch their heads in disbelief - thereby delegitimising him.    2) Theresa May needs to get a deal, but won't compromise Britain's standing by getting a bad deal - even with America. Why? Because she has said getting a ""good deal"" with the EU isn't even a priority.    All in all, it behooves both parties to strike up a deal that is favorable to both sides, and really is a ""win-win"". Trump has more to lose here than May arguably since if he can't even get a mutually beneficial deal with our (historical) greatest political, military, and economic partner, his supporters will start openly asking ""if he can't get a deal with Britain, then how good is he at deals??""     Great statement. It is so true, I hope thousands see this and channel their energy towards our own problems instead of worrying about ever thing Trump does.  People need to start being more critical of what they see and hear on media and think for themselves and look at the real problems in our own country that are going un-noticed and are stripping all our rights and privacy away. It's that way everywhere.  Congress could pass a ""Gingers will be executed on sight"" bill is Trump came out against it and tweeted something outrageous the day before.   https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding  >  Parkinson observed that a committee whose job is to approve plans for a nuclear power plant may spend the majority of its time on relatively unimportant but easy-to-grasp issues, such as what materials to use for the staff bikeshed, while neglecting the design of the power plant itself, which is far more important but also far more difficult to criticize constructively And I America they should. But more people are protesting that prick that. The fact the Tories are shitting all over us. It's so stupid. Then why didn't they protest against Obama?  > Not to mention that you need a utility bill and passport now to register with a GP in the name of public security.  No, you don't.  Some GP surgeries misinterpreted the requirements and tried to require it but it is most definitely not a requirement.  From http://www.nhs.uk/nhsengland/aboutnhsservices/doctors/pages/nhsgps.aspx  ""You should not be refused registration or appointments because you dont have a proof of address or personal identification at hand. It is not considered a reasonable ground to refuse registration. This also applies if you are an asylum seeker, refugee, a homeless patient or an overseas visitor, whether lawfully in the UK or not."" Stop spreading lies, as /u/tilman2015 points out in his (or her) link. I have the same weird feeling, I'm stuck in the UK until I finish my degree but my gut instinct is to get out as soon as possible. ""Fascism""... Look up what he said about Islam, makes Trump look like Angela Lansbury. That's kind of irrelevant to the situation though.  The invitation has already been offered, and it would be a yuge slap in Trump's face if she were to renege on it.   Given her role and the relationship between the two countries, she has to *manage* the guy. Insulting his ego by cancelling the event would be highly counterproductive to that responsibility.  It's so petty though. The visit is happening, so why risk hindering relations and casuing tension with one of our most important relationships, and one of the most powerful countries in the world?  There's literally nothing to gain from ""denying"" a state visit. Donald Trump isnt getting an invitation to make a state visit. The President of the United States is getting an invitation to make a state visit. The *office* of president must be accorded the proper respect and invited as it has been in the past. That Donald is in office is irrelevant, the Americans elected him and thats not our business.  How do we regard America? How importantly do we regard our relationship? Is denying their leader the respect and fanfare and hospitality of a state visit how we treat our closest friend and ally? > The petition is to not make it a state visit.  That would mean - Trump not meeting the Queen. Not sure what that would do (or not do). It's not like Trump cares. Despotism is a form of government in which a single entity rules with absolute power. That entity may be an individual, as in an autocracy, or it may be a group, as in an oligarchy. The English dictionary defines despotism as ""the rule of a despot; the exercise of absolute authority."" How is Trump a depot? Not everyone you disagree with is automatically Hitler. I agree but honestly it's made me more convinced that Brexit is the right choice. This US election has proven to me that a single government with control over a population and area as large as the US doesn't work. Its clear to me from the reactions I've seen online that the only thing people in places like California and the Rust belt states have in common are a nationality, they clearly have far to different needs and wants and its seems unfair that they should have to share a government.   Now I know the EU isn't a single government but it shares the problem i described above. >Got a lot less press coverage though.  Oh I wonder why... The modern world seems to be going a tad insane with each passing year, super polarised narratives and lots of hate coupled with an ""us vs them"" mentality.   Its worrisome to some degree.  Seriously, why is the **United Kingdom** subreddit full of shit about Trump!?  Perhaps they need to consider the Queens age and longevity, as well as the succession! Get it in now. Just about the only thing you can probably rely on from this trip is that the Queen won't screw up. Would you be so confident about a King Charles? Well excuse me for using a poor example. Let us then say that May can no longer sit down, and persuade Trump on NATO issues or other matters of state that are in GB's best interest.  Apparently you missed the point. It doesn't matter about the wrong example.You guys would go ballistic if we said no more communication, and all British government employees, and head of states are persona non grata. Right? Because I bet we could round up a petition asking Trump to do so. Then both of us, who are allies, would now be at a state of Cold War. You want that shit? Then use some common sense, and knock off the childish petition rheoric of banning Trump.  Thank god you got a PM who has some common sense, and ignores such nonsense from the British people petitioning. Charles isn't allowed to talk about Climate change with him as it may 'anger' him I'd imagine those protesting either voted remain, or if they voted leave it could have easily have been for another reason. The immigration ""issue"" isn't 100% of the story I don't think the people who voted Brexit are the ones out protesting tbf  Even though I'm a remain voter, the difference is staggering. Being in the EU allowed near unregulated immigration from all EU countries via freedom of movement laws. There's a difference between wanting some control over immigration vs already having strong immigration controls and blocking people using poorly veiled attempts to specifically block Muslims Likewise, disagreeing with the left doesn't make you a Trump supporter, it means you can critically analyse what you read.  demanding a government to hurt political ties with another because the representative of the other government is an asshole is what I was referring to > It means you read the news.  Would that be HuffPo, WaPo, or BuzzFeed? President Trump* Anyone believes the leftits propaganda is on the left. But he wouldn't have resigned had Brexit not happened and he was the instigator of Brexit. Also, had Brexit not happened, the UK wouldn't need to establish this outsider position with the USA Right, so I think he isn't fit to be president because he doesn't believe in climate change. I dont think that anyone who ignores scientific process isn't fit to be president. Does that mean Im in a bubble then? Can I not be outraged because you find it off putting? Im ever so sorry I disagree. In both the area I live whilst at home (middle of england) and at university (south-east of England) the vast majority of not almost everyone I meet usually of my age are strongly against a lot of Trump's ideals and actions.   Of course this is just for mostly my friend range and slight age bubble so the information could be skewed, but even a fair few of the older generation are against him as well! Umm what? Trump steamrolled the Republican party,  with every single one of them trying to take him down.  You werent paying attention to the primaries were you? Virtually all the top hitters tried to take him down. You're really discounting how garbage the GOP is in its current state, which is the real reason Trump won the nomination.  Almost nobody in the GOP wanted him as the candidate, but he was ultimately much more popular than sniveling rat Ted Cruz, the looney toons brain surgeon, and the rest of the unlikable clown car that made up the republican party last year.  As much as people hate Trump, he was the best candidate with the best chance to win the republican party had.  They tried to take him on directly, indirectly, and using slimeball dirty politics--and none of it helped. Um what? Ever heard of nevertrump? There were alot of republicans that tried to stop him. He just swept them away. On both sides. Get on mate! Even that is just so ridiculously counter-productive.  *Why* would you go out of your way to slight a head of state, when your goal is to have a discussion and possibly find common ground?      That type of thinking is just so childishly short-sighted which is why these 'protests' are generally insufferable. You're making me feel gaslighted. How   is the hate for Trump in any way comparable to Obama's? I think people are justified in their low opinions of the POTUS. Very justified.  you might be mis interpreting, not sure. The point I was making is you guys have casually hosted people so far off the scale they make Trump look like the Dalai Lama - and yet he's the one you think is worth getting worked up over.  Makes sense. Thank you for the response. Well the Queen wouldn't really be snubbing him.  An official state visit is done as an invitation from the head of state.  The Queen could just wait say she isn't ready to schedule in a State Visit from the US at the moment and just not invite him until all the protests blow over.  Obama was president for 3 years before his state visit.   This won't happen though, she has met with worse people than Trump and since we are begging cap in hand for a trade deal with the US and Trump is really keen for his first official visit to be the UK its going to go ahead regardless of how many protesters turn out.  Well, she did drive the Saudi King around in a car, so she may really do that! The Queen will express no preference, and will welcome Trump with grace and cordiality. Like she does with everyone. It's not her place to be divisive or outspoken, and it would be an astonishing breach of decades of protocol.   That said, May's burrowing up Trump's anus is quite humiliating to Britain and I've no doubt her Maj will have extra hand sanitiser at the ready for his visit.  Theresa May **does not have the ability to invite another leader on a State Visit.**  To do so now is a total lack of courtesy. War with America, obviously.  I mean the Queen meets with Saudi royals who own sex slaves, smuggle drugs into the middle east, have gays executed, and think that rape victims are adulteresses.   So if she won't meet with Trump that's just fucking stupid.  Let's find out.  She's already expressed concern over May inviting him to meet her so early, it's not usual for a president to have a state visit this early.  Apparently I'm not the only one to think trump isn't desrving of special treatment as compared to every other president, I'm not against him meeting her (depending on how the next year goes) but I'm against him getting specail treatment. No doubt we would find out in 140 characters or less If the British people physically block a lot of stuff from happening with protests, that would be a good step in the right direction.  If Trump literally has to be helicoptered from place to place the message would be effectively sent. The impacts would be further damage to your own credibility on American shores and probable annoyance and faint amusement from the Brits on whose doorstep you've decided to continue your domestic dispute Trump would be pissed and Britain doesn't want that. She most likely will, even if she's not the agressor, do you really expect trump to go an entire visit without him provoking some reaction? Mostly positive. Trump has the lowest approval ratings and got them quicker than any other president in history. People need to stop catering to this small loud and toxic demographic.   I hope the queen snubs him. He's a fucking ass. ""Mrs Tweedy, the chickens are revolting!""  ""Finally, something we agree upon"" She'd do a better job. Can she be Prime Minister instead? Please? Like literally make anyone else PM. It's a protest against the government's stance. It might say ""don't embarrass the queen"" on the petition, but no one really cares about the queen. It's a protest against the government's appeasement of Trump despite his actions, and their refusal to stand up for what is right.  >the majority of the Left don't even support the monarchy and believe the Royal family to be ""a waste of taxpayer money""  You know this how? Why not? I live only down the road from them - it's an affectionate impression.   The biggest problem is that, with Brexit currently happening, we are going to be more reliant than ever on our friendship with America. May is a leather-faced bitch, but she's also entirely right to be cosying up to Trump at the moment.   Of course, personally, I'd rather that we stopped pratting about with Brexit and just fucking accept that we're better off in the EU, but that's a separate issue. Even if, by some miracle, we don't leave, we still depend quite heavily on our political connection to America, and pissing off the incredibly volatile man who has just been handed control of it is precisely the last thing we want to do right now.  As much as I hate trump, I've got better things to do after working 8 hours and going home to then not stop til at least 11pm. I'm pretty sure I'm in the majority here aswell, don't be mistaken though he's a cunt and doesn't deserve to meet the queen. That's how democracy works bro.  Once you get a crowd of 5000 people in one place, that means you're the whole country. Yeah, whenever there is a protest with more than 10 people, it's automatically the voice of the people. For every single issue you will always find thousands of people willing to go to the streets to protest it, it does not mean that it's what the whole country thinks. A million or so ""signatures"" on an online petition that requires minimal effort, followed by a few thousand people marching in person. It just isn't gonna cut it.  Majority of Tories did not want Brexit just going to mention that because i've seen a lot of left wing views blaming the current PM for how things are going post referendum. Like this was their secret plot to take over Britain. I don't think they're doing anything of the sort I think they're very stuck on how to sell the idea of Brexit to the country because not many months ago they were campaigning against it saying it was an awful idea. They have to draft some kind of Bill of Rights because we are leaving the EU and their regulations. This is simply a fact.  I just want to say that brexit isn't 100% assured right now, there is a slight chance that parliament won't give the go ahead.  In other words, please don't take my hopes and smash them on harsh reality, like so many political promises. It is far less depressing to think our government is incompetent, rather than doing all this shady shit on purpose for some sinister reason That's really good insight actually, thank you :)  If that could be the case then great. What we need in that is effective opposition from the Labour Party to steer any deal away from open season on the NHS and agreements to any changes to British employment rights that would mimic US employment rights... which hardly exist. Oh and for food manufacturing to not take on the same level of safety as the FDA let's happen in the US either.  Other than that, rock on! This isn't bikeshedding; bikeshedding applies very specifically to committees and teams trying to solve problems, not protestors. I see bike shedding every day at work and that is not what this is. Some of us did. Some of us have been getting angry and protesting for years about the way the government(s) of the west have been spying and tightening their grip. Just seems that now there's a few more people awake. Because Obama was much better at lying about his actions and intentions.  We did, and Bush, Clinton, Bush...some of us have been asking them to get out of our country and our affairs for years. Pack it in boys.  Obama did the same thing, so we might as well give trump a pass. I mean, he's clearly as sensible and restrained as Obama so he won't do anything stupid.  Thanks man, I was so very afraid until you posted this glorious post.   Look up what Islam does to gay people and women every day in every nation where it holds hegemony It's misguided to think she can manage him. If that's the basis for any decision, it's completely wrong.  Mexico canceled on him :-) it was great! Exactly. Trump needs a good slapping. That's why people are annoyed, because she offered it despite him being in power for a couple of weeks.  It's pretty rare to get that invite within the first year, never mind the first week.  Now it's put pressure on the Queen. Does she accept and piss off the country? Does she decline and piss off the US government?  Wouldn't be a problem if May wasn't being so rash. Yeah but with his tiny hands a rebuttal slap isn't even going to sting. #sad its a huge slap in the electorates face and the crowns face to have offered it. Consider it tit for tat, with may receiving slaps from both sides. Or at least hopefully Maybe not before, but I'd bet he would care - a whole lot - if the offer were reneged on now though.   People with big egos don't like to lose face, and being de-invited from this sort of party is a pretty clear slap. > Trump not meeting the Queen. Not sure what that would do (or not do). It's not like Trump cares.  From what we're led to believe, that's something Trump does care about, more so than meeting any politician. Trump has let it be known he wants a bigger state event than that accorded to Obama, he's also let it be known that his mother was a massive admirer of the Queen and that he wants to make her memory proud etc. I expect Trump to be on best behaviour actually, and for this part of the gig to pass off relatively easily. It's the noise surrounding it that has the capacity to go wrong, and anything seems possible there. Remember George W Bush was driven along empty streets as tumbleweed blew through London > the rule of a despot; the exercise of absolute authority.  So the best way to start doing this in America would be to pass everything by executive order, fire any person who you do not agree with and promote unelected cronies into key positions.   http://i.imgur.com/HNcxB.gif Not every despot is automatically Hitler either... I didn't make that comparison but thanks that you did.  They did have plenty of press coverage, until the British government said, if you stop covering this issue, we will extend the immunity to the media too.  Well, the one thing I noticed was as soon as he knew he wasn't going to be monarch he suddenly started talking a lot of sense and speaking out on good causes. It leads me to think he was told to act dumb in preparation for the throne. Ah yes they also have the exact same ""states rights"" argument that the South brings up. It wasn't really about immigration, it was about sovereignty, sovereignty to control immigration. Shhhh. That's not possible.  I mean let's face it, if it wasn't for the left then Trump wouldn't be President. No it isn't. You said, clearly, ""the left"". It's in writing. Want me quote you?  You were very specific.  He did not want Brexit. He also wanted a fair democratic vote on Brexit. So he made a hard choice to give the people what they wanted. He actually listened to the country as a whole and not just his voters which I think took mass amounts of balls.   Brexit did happen and it was out of the then PM's hands. He gave the vote to the people and the people voted out.  When all republicans AND Hillary spend all their campaigns talking about Trump, it's easy to see why he won. Democrats putting the most corrupt candidate they could who was under FBI investigation didn't help either. Lots of heads of state don't get the treatment American heads of state have traditionally got. Trump doesn't have to get that and isn't entitled to it, so not getting it isn't a major snub and given his Muslim ban, even in it's current form, and his campaigning on bringing back torture surely there is a limit to what we should tolerate enough to give the very best red carpet treatment to. Mugabe isn't going to lead us down the road to global instability. It is often harder to stand up to your friends than it is to your enemies but it is often just as important. For centuries the UK and the US could assume they were on the same page and agreed on some fundamental values a lot of people feel as though that is becoming less assured.   You know there were huge protests over both those, right?  >An official state visit is done as an invitation from the head of state.   Yesterday Theresa May started saying that she had ""informally"" invited Trump. Not sure if this means that the actual invitation from HMQ hasn't been sent yet or whether May is building in some wriggle room to postpone the state visit element. May said she was all about listening. Ha! No no, she needs to invite him, and once he's at the gate, she needs to walk out on balcony and deliver an insult that would leave even the best of SNL or Monty python to shame. Then she should just go back inside while DT stands there confused as to what just happened. Then Obama pulls up to the gate, rolls down his window, and informs trump he just got burned. Obama then proceeds to enter for his meeting with the queen over tea.   There you go. He will have that ammo to use if he gets a state visit. Took Obama 3 years I did it in less than one Yes, but Theresa May needs Trump for the negotiations with the EU. How else is she gonna pretend that she has someone else to turn to than the EU? We all know that the US, especially under Trump and with the UKs plans to be a tax haven, won't save their economy, but it seems our friends from the island are already running out of ideas on how to make this Brexit shit work out.  Maybe Ol' Lizzy isn't so good after all ""Queen 'Accidentally' Drives into Thames River with U.S President in Car"" [Just imagine the Queen of England looking at you like this. You can't not accept a lift from her](http://www.motherjones.com/files/queenoverdrive.jpg) In my head, Queenie is going to give Trump a smack with her handbag and tell him to get his act together.  May trying to burrow up Modi's anus (her first state visit), coming to India with a hat in hand asking for trade gave so many Indians a great sense of Schadenfreude >The Queen will express no preference, and will welcome Trump with grace and cordiality  Undoubtedly. However, it seems a given that some people are shown more grace and cordiality than others. Apparently, she took steps to avoid meeting Ceausescu for any longer than she had to, for example.   If he comes over to meet with The Queen, I have no doubt everything will be done according to protocol. But that doesn't mean the atmosphere won't be a bit frosty.  With Brexit we're in a very tricky position. We need to do all we can to prepare for trade deals fir after it happens. Unexpected Chicken Run! Damn my faulty memory. Thanks for the refresher. My favourite protest sign so far has to be the 'Appeasement never got Chamberlain anywhere', and I'm seeing some definite parallels here. If you're a citizen of the US you won't be detained. The dual citizenships referred to buy the executive order refer to two countries that are not the US and one of the banned ones.  Also, because Iran would not do that. 1) because USA residents with valid visas are not blocked from entering the country or deported. They are put through a secondary interview process  and then allowed to leave.   2) because its a stupid idea.  It could damage relations, but how would it be economic suicide? Do you think Trump would pull a Mexican wall on us? > I'd rather that we stopped pratting about with Brexit and just fucking accept that we're better off in the EU  That _would_ probably be for the best of everyone involved, but I've given up all hope on that happening anytime soon. Still, you'll need good Brexit conditions. Falling into the open arms of Trump will make it much harder to keep access to the market and other perks.   Basically, the UK will need to chose which ally to favor: Trump or the EU.  May problem is that she let every situation rots.   She let the Leave side and Boris making wild claim on the EU upset all its leaders for 6 months before clarifying her position. She seemingly ignored 48% of the population, made no comment, made no concession that they even exist and could have a point, nope, 6 months after the fact she just present her plan and bury them all into a ""the nation is united statement"". The Leave campaign has been fraught with lies, and at no point she has tried to at least debunk some of them. She just let the liars get away with them.   Of course she has no fucking choice but take whatever scrap Trump throws at her. But she could talk to the people in a more open manner. At least she could do it in a way that the does not look like she thinks it is a good idea. There is a difference between being painted in a corner and being the US lapdog barking on request.   Betting the house on Trump alone is a risky deal. That will upset everyone from the EU to Australia and Canada.   I can't wait to eat US made produce undercutting UK farmers! Ready to chow down on chlorinated chicken? Do you like tumours? Yuuuu-mmmy! Genuine question as I'm from the US so I don't know much about the Queen: when you say ""doesn't deserve to meet the queen"" are you implying she is someone great enough that it is a privilege to be in her presence/meet her? I'm sorry if that came off weird or offensive I'm just curious as to how you guys view her :) So you're saying the opinion of those million people is worthless or doesn't count because it requires ""minimal effort""? Yes they need a Bill of Rights, but the idea from the Tories of scrapping our current one isn't a post Brexit idea.  May has been all for it for quite a while now, in 2015 the new Bill of Rights was ear marked to be pushed through in the summer 2016.  One reason it wasn't was push back from the EU court of human rights over fears the new act would set the Ireland peace talks back decades, which it likely could given how delicate a situation the Good Friday agreement is.  Yes many Tories campaigned against Brexit but some of the top Brexit campaigners were top Tories (Boris for example).  However, I also find it hard to trust what the parties are actually campaigning for, given that same Tory party, during the Scottish referendum, had 2 conflicting party lines depending on which side of the border you were. If you were in Scotland, all we heard from the Tories was ""We're better together, don't leave, we love being a Union with you, you guys are important to us"" when south of the border the main reports were ""Fuck those thieving Jocks and their Barnett Formula, bunch of scrounging leeches!  We don't need them!"".  So you can perhaps forgive me for being distrusting of what the Tories party line actually is.  Thing is, why don't we just adopt the same bill of right currently in place by the EU?  We could just tipex out the title and write ""UK Human Rights"" on the top but they don't want to.  They're not going to give us any more basic human rights so that leaves me with the question, what ones do they want to take away?.... There's absolutely no way parliament will vote against, it will be a big majority, even if every labour and lib dem voted against (which ofc won't happen anyway) it would still pass. The House of Lords will be the interesting one, as they are unelected and have no one to answer to regarding their vote. I still think it'll pass but it might be tight. It's happening, that's the unfortunate side of a Democracy in that some votes don't go our way.  I voted remain but the leavers won so we have to deal with it.  For parliament to even entertain the idea that they'll just scrap the vote result and stay in the EU anyway is totally undemocratic.  How is that any different to the Gambian president refusing to leave office after being voted out?  If we start undermining the basic principles of Democracy we are just going to shift even further towards dictatorships where those in power decide what votes count and what votes don't.  We're out and the other EU countries want us out now after the cluster fuck job May has done at ""negotiating"".  The longer we fuck around with the idea it's not happening, the less time we have to prepare for the situation that we face.   Problem is that expecting effective opposition from the Labour party has been a recipe for disappointment for quite a while now... True this is more like the Availability Heuristic, Bandwagon Effect, Confirmation Bias, Outcome Bias, Salience, Selective Perception and Stereotyping at play.  I don't think it's ridiculous to question inconsistent reactions that seem to only depend on the person doing it. Yeah but Churchill said mean things. You have to feel sorry for the left, they have lost their minds. I'm using a different interpretation of the word ""manage"".   In this case it's not so much ""telling him precisely what to do and having the empowerment to make it stick"" as it is ""dealing with a negative situation to get as much of a positive outcome as possible"".   Making Trump feel like he's been insulted would not help with the latter process at all.  Yep great for the peso especially.  The UK isn't currently having any issues with their currency right? Yeah, Mexico lost the chance to negotiate the wall, the peso fell, and now their imports will most likely be taxed. It was great. That's because he's flatslap TARGETTING Mexico with that stupid wall of his.   Aside from being a generally distasteful politician that has passed a lot of controversial legislation already, he hasn't done anything specifically against the UK as a very precise target... at least not yet.  Not only that, but the EU needs a proper affirmation that despite Brexit, you still share some common values to give UK good Brexit conditions.   Abiding to Trump's ego is not going in this direction. > People with big egos don't like to lose face, and being de-invited from this sort of party is a pretty clear slap.  It's not going to be a ""clear slap"" on Donald Trump, it'd be a ""clear slap"" on the President of the United States of America.  Trump will want an audience. He won't accept empty streets. But I guarantee if that audience is full of protesters he will say the were there to support him. ""Look at all those people! They just love me!"" you seem confused.   maybe you've forgotten that the president is supposed to be in complete control of the executive branch?  the thing that makes it a democratic system with checks and balances is the fact that he was elected and the existence of the legislature and court system.  there's also this glaring oversight on your part of state governments.    the person fired was just there for another day or two waiting for the new pick by Trump to be confirmed. she just threw a tantrum on her way out.    literally every president promotes whoever they want into their cabinet.   an example of actual autocratic rule would be if Trump decided that California shouldn't be a state any more and dissolved it to be reallocated, and then made it illegal to criticize him and set started convicting people and throwing them in jail.  A despot rules without intervention. If you think Trump can do what he likes, you don't understand how a republic works. He believes in homeopathy, he might be an environmentalist but to say he talks a lot of sense is pushing it.  That's partly true. The left drove so many centre-right voters over to Trump. But, also, if it wasn't for the GOP, and the lack of better centre-right candidates, Trump also wouldn't be president. And, if it wasn't for Hillary, the DNC and their lack of better centre-left candidates, Trump wouldn't president.  >He also wanted a fair democratic vote on Brexit.  There's no way he would have called for the vote had he thought it had even a chance of not going his way. He wanted to create the illusion that he cared about the people who wanted brexit, but thought it would be a firm ""remain"" vote. He was wrong. He leveraged a vote to stay / leave Europe right before the UK election because polls were showing Labour in the lead.  He panicked and appealed to the alt right and misguided nationalism in a desperate attempt to get votes.  He did so because he wanted to stay in power not because he cared about a ""fair diplomatic vote"" on brexit lol!   Fast forward a year later and neither side ran fair or even remotely accurate campaigns. None of what happened was really about the vote. Cameron also didn't foresee the mayor of London at the time, boris Johnson, stabbing him in the back and running the leave campaign in a thinly veiled attempt at usurping the leadership of the party. Johnson didn't give a fuck about brexit it was all about weakening Cameron and getting the leadership, Cameron didn't give a fuck about having a democratic brexit vote he just wanted to hold on to the leadership weeks before the national election for which the polls were saying he was going to lose. Brexit was his trump card (yes I said it) a ticket for at least one more year in power at the expense of a divided nation. He didn't give a fuck about me you the people or anyone else. Please don't be so naive.  The only good thing post brexit vote was Johnson getting a taste of his own medicine and having his own people turn on him literally 30 mins before his announcement that he would run for leadership. That was some fantastic game of thrones level shit.  The whole thing was never about Brexit, just two selfish politicians desperately clinging to power. Yeah, he gave the vote to the people which was a power play to regain popularity and he absolutely never thought, like most people, that Britain was going to vote to leave. That too, Hillary's nomination was just Martha Coakley all over again--they pushed a horrendous, unlikable candidate forward because they thought it to be an unlosable race to begin with, and the voters rewarded them by dropping a big, fat fuck you in the ballot box.  Completely regardless of what Trump's presidency brings, I do believe that the collective hubris it brought upon American politics will really prevent future election cycles from turning out like this one, on both sides. Doing it now *would* be a major snub.  Not making the offer at all in the first place, wouldn't have been.   Everyone keeps calling it a Muslim ban. Aren't there like 37 other majority Muslim countries that aren't on the list? Asking for a friend.  'It's not a major snub to deny Trump the same treatment as other US heads of state.' It isn't a Muslim ban for fucks sake...  The palace has said they are dissapointed in May inviting him so soon, since it goes against custom.  Basically may is the metophorical drunk inviting stragers round at 4 in the morning when her metophorical flat mate has work in the morning. May can invite him over to talk *government* all she wants, the Queen is the Head of *State*. Pulling a Ted Kennedy, let's see how this plays out. *""Slow down you crazy broad! Theres a river ahead!""*  *""I am awaited in Valhalla!""* Too risky, she would never let Charles have the throne. River Thames. 'River' always goes first in British English.  Serious: what would happen if the Queen were to accidentally kill a head of state? Good thing the car was being remote controlled by Queen, drinking tea in the Palace. She's Diana to meet him The royals have more of a motoring history with chauffeur-driven Mercedes Benz in Paris in recent years,. NO MICHAEL THIS IS NOT THE ROAD Sacrificing herself for the good of us all, what a hero. The sacrifice play. Not the hero we deserve, but the one we need right now. Yeah, that's why they said that. It wasn't a state visit.  It was a trade mission.  It isn't possible for Theresa May to make a state visit as she isn't a head of state. Umm...I've got some bad news for you: http://www.wilx.com/content/news/5-year-old-boy-detained-at-airport-412143253.html They DID detain American citizens. Try again bub  Well I'm up for trying it just to see what happens... I literally have no fucking clue what the man is capable. The only thing I am pretty sure about is that he doesn't give a shit about us at all. Well we need all the trading partners we can get. But personally I want to be part of antagonising him as much as possible, as he won't kill anyone from england. The economic danger we are in is far below the mortal danger arab countries are in The *interest of the people* is just something they used to say.  The odds of us relying on the US rather than on European farmers are quite low. Even with tariffs, shipping chicken from the US is going to be more expensive than getting it from Europe. The main problems will be in our exports, rather than our imports, I'd imagine. The petitions platform for the UK Government is so underpublicised and overlooked issues can be put before Parliament and they can get their due consideration. It's not so that one side of the argument over a highly contentious and divisive issue can get their own way. People make petitions for these issues then get offended and call lack of democracy when they're predictably rejected.    For example the petition on cannabis legalisation, which is obviously a contentious issue that's not going to have unilateral support, isn't going to get Parliament to change their stance on drugs and nor should it.   I like to think Parliament will be taking notes about the fact there are a small percentage of people that feel strongly about these issue, but the idea that they should have acted on this petition is nothing short of ludicrous. It's about as valuable as anyone else's opinion. There's simply no reason to heed it though if it is only an opinion being expressed.   Imagine a hypothetical situation where every, say, Ron Paul supporter had turned out onto the streets when Obama was elected. That would be an extremely noteworthy, visible show of a group of unhappy individuals expressing their opinions. That said, I wouldn't have expected Obama to say ""You know, these people seem upset. Alright, I guess I'll adopt the libertarian platform instead of what I was going to do.""  It doesn't matter because they're only one of 60 million and if it's anything like the brexit petition, most probably aren't even UK citizens.      Oh cold reality.  I know that parliament won't veto article fifty. The only hope I have now is that we won't end up with the worst of a bad situation.   Although it'd be great to see a thoroughly pissed off Farage on the news, I know it won't happen, we'll be stuck with the insufferably smug twat.  The best we can hope for is that May is forced to do a soft brexit, keeping us in the open market. I have a lot of respect for you.  You're literally the most open-minded person I've seen in a brexit-related debate. I did vote leave, aware that there are many short term negative effects, in the hope that we have a better long term future.  Unfortunately, a large number of remain voters are unable to accept the idea that democracy is what it is; trying to force petitions for a re-count and such.  Whichever way anyone voted, the best thing we can do is just accept it's happening, and work together, instead of delaying it, and bitching about it. That will only make the likelihood of it failing bigger. Those topics seem pretty hard to grasp.  Lets get back to the shed materials. No, none at all! It's not like our pound to dollar ratio went almost 1:1! /s There is a difference between the position and the person occupying it at the moment. Next week on ""The Trump Whisperer""... If you haven't been watching the news the last 8 days maybe you should. He's well on his way.  He already had popularity he was voted in with something like 38% of the vote in 2015. He didn't need to pander to anyone he was already going to finish his term anyway he wasn't trying to get another one.  They played chicken with the voters and lost.  ""If you think I'm bad, vote for Trump, I DARE you"". We have to assume that May - who is very guarded about her real opinions - has some alignment with Trump's policies. Her every instinct is regressive, controlling and anti-freedom. She is a prig - her obsession with porn and female ejaculation is telling - and she has made numerous efforts to increase surveillance and snooping, both as Home Secretary and PM. Offering the State Visit instead of dangling it as a reward down the line was a major miscalculation. Now this hangs over her, and the UK, while Trump dismantles democracy and the US constitution - he will be coming here as a Dictator, leader of a bigoted administration : anti-immigrant, anti-minority, anti-LGBT, anti-women, and be feted with all the honours we have to bestow.  It's more like when you finally realise your drunk friend has been a cunt all this time and never cared about you at all. Yeah, nobody seems to be saying he shouldn't be invited. It's the state visit element that people are objecting to. What did ted Kennedy do ""Look at me! I'm James Bond now!"" I feel like it'll go swimmingly. [removed] LBJ would literally do this to freak people out.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphicar#In_popular_culture ""Ted Kennedy, take the wheel!"" ""The GPS says turn right""  ""..Michael, it can't mean that! There's a lake there!""  ""The machine knows!"" > ""Queen 'Accidentally' Drives into Thames River with U.S President & Prince Charles in Car""   The driver will be a decoy queen. Don't worry, she'd duck and roll out of the car before it hit the water This is what I was looking for. River she's going to drive him into the?? I wouldn't say ""always"", I'd say ""tends to""  there's a lot of them on this wikipedia list of rivers in england that put river after: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rivers_of_England National holiday in Ireland.  probably three points on her driving licence (negligent driving), insurance premium would go up by about 50%, and whoever lost their head of state would need to get a new one. This was caused by the confusion of the order being passed so suddenly and no one knowing all it entailed yet, the article says the senator called authorities and told them not to detain the boy, but I guess they missed the memo.  So no, this isn't a normal thing thanks to the immigration ban. That did happen, but it wasn't supposed to. I'm not happy about the entire thing, but those people were detained because the people acting out what they were told to do didn't understand exactly what they were supposed to be doing, making a bad situation even worse. Well by that logic the leave votes in the  EU referendum were also worthless considering there was only 17 million out of 60. Or at least the relative dignity of both. Wasn't the referendum promised (during his 2015 election campaign) as a way of appeasing/pandering to the old right backbenchers in the Conservatives?   So if he backtracked, he may well have ended up facing a vote of no confidence?  She's got visions of herself being Maggie Thatcher, and Trump being the new Reagan.    Not even close. In the states we don't even get to discuss the pros and cons of female ejaculate in the house OR the senate. If there's an overriding political ideology that May embodies it's what the media calls ""pragmatism"", but is in fact unprincipled ambition. I don't know whether she actually believes in any of these causes - frankly she seems to robotic to believe in anything at all - but regardless she'll fulfill the will of the party because that's what keeps her in a job. >We have to assume that May - who is very guarded about her real opinions - has some alignment with Trump's policies.   Or she's desperate for a trade deal to buoy post-Brexit Britain and sees Trump as someone she can flatter into favorable terms.  also wtf Some people are definitely saying he shouldn't be invited, but that's not going to happen. [Chappaquiddick incident](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chappaquiddick_incident)  In 1969 he drove a car into a tidal channel, fled, and didn't report it for ten hours.  The woman with him died in the car.  The diver claimed she looked like she died from suffocation, so there's been an ongoing claim that he was either drunk or he killed her and made it look like an accident.  Charged with fleeing the scene of an accident and got probation. Drove his car into a body of water with a girl in it. Left her to die and didn't call the police until 2 days later I think.      Heavily speculated that drinking was involved.      Edit: foggy on some of the details. You'd do best to research the story for yourselves, but that's the gist of it. Drove into a river with his lover. He got out of the sinking car leaving her trapped in an air pocket where she gradually suffocated over the course of hours while he pretended nothing had happened and didn't report the accident. The local rescue guy said he could've had her out of the car in minutes but Teddy let her die.  Ed: stray 'n' that might cause cofusion. Drove drunk [off a bridge. Killed a woman.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chappaquiddick_incident)    Edit: changed pier to bridge. To add to what /u/FallsZero said, the girl was also pregnant. Back in those days being a Kennedy was on par with being a royal, and having a kid out of wedlock and with a *commoner* would have been damaged their political dynasty.   So that also fuels the speculations that it was premeditated. Ted was a pretty dirty politician so though I can't say that he did it deliberately I wouldn't be surprised if he did.  Drove the Saudi King around in a car. Good show, ole bean.  ""Prince Harry said to be Personally Flying VP Mike Pence to Funeral."" Well there *is* a certain similarity between England and Dagobah... SHe doesn't have a licence iirc. Even if it was caused by confusion, its still an effect of the immigration ban... What about next time it's not supposed to happen but it does? How many times do they get a pass before incompetency is just policy? > That did happen, but it wasn't supposed to.  Republican strategy in a nutshell. I think the original referendum idea was brought up way back in 2013. There was a minority of conservatives still calling for it but there was nowhere near enough to unseat him as PM.  > Thatcher ... Reagan.  That was unpalatable enough. Trump/May is downright vomit-inducing. No, but we do get to discuss the ramifications of doping in major league baseball, lol. Theresa May invented and implemented one of the most controversial laws in immigration history for any country.

Yup, because in the U.K. licenses are granted by (the power of) the Queen, so she just says ""I AM the queen"". She may or may not have a licence. But she doesn't need one - since she is the one granting the licences, she could grant one to herself whenever she pleases. Indeed it was, but it isn't a normal, intentional part of the ban, and won't happen again now that things are calming down. I'm not trying to argue policy or morality. I was just answering a stupid question about a stupid joke with a genuine answer. I assume it'll happen a whole shitload more times until the whole world is a perfect place to live in. wow.  never heard about that before, it's akin to serfdom.

How come he got out of the car after it was in the lake and the girl didn't ? Was she unconscious, or stuck with the seat belt or something?  That was the point of not calling them I think.  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Yup! The Kennedy's tried to keep it quiet because that sort of thing was ""indecent"" for the public to know about in those days. But they did have a sexual relationship.    This is a weird episode of Black Mirror Same reason she doesn't have a passport. Passports are issued by her so she could just write on a scrap of paper and it would most likely be legal.

"19",18,"5r5x0u","2017-01-31","The Philippines maybe poor but it had accepted so many refugees over its history.  This maybe a PR move by Duterte  but the Philippines has a big history of accepting refugees. It accepted many Israelis on ww2 , Vietnamese boat people and just 2 years ago it accepted rohingya Muslims which got turned by many Asian countries.   ....then killing them. When Duterte is looking more idealistic than American values I feel sorry for the state of the world. Out of the frying pan... Rastafarian's stay away. Its a Trap dont do it I am not sure his country is the place they would want to go to right now. Not that Duterte actually expects many people to try to follow up on his ""offer"" anyway. Remember when we thought he was the craziest world leader? Duterte isnt anti-muslim. I think some of his family members are muslim. Its not a ""shock"" per se. The ones down south are islamic terrorists, he's never grouped them together with muslims as a whole.  *Bob Newhart in the role of refugee:* Oh... great... I guess... I doubt people want to go there considering he's on a mass murdering spree. Philippines already has conflicts with Muslims and has been target of terrorists attacks by Muslim separatists. It is very strange that they are considering to accept Muslim refugees.   Edit: I am not telling that Muslims are troublemakers or bad people. But it really happened there.  - [Philippine Muslim extremists from Maute group stage mass jailbreak](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-28/philippine-muslim-extremists-stage-mass-jailbreak/7792756)  - [Several hurt in Christmas church attack in the Philippines](http://www.dw.com/en/several-hurt-in-christmas-church-attack-in-the-philippines/a-36905157)  The majority of Philippines are Catholics, but there is a Muslim minority. Receiving them or extra-judicially exterminating them? You know things are off when Duterte seems like the logical one in a given situation.  Duterte hospitality: bring in a bunch of refugees and shoot them. *2 weeks later*  ""Refugees taken in after US ban all found dead after they were accused of drug use"" Except who in their right mind would go to Philippines? Refugees look for safe and wealthy countries, not Philippines. Talk about stuck between a rock and a hard place ...unless they're drug addicts. In which case, they can go f themselves  How odd... Yeah but who would like to go to there? Does he want to use them for experiments or something? So suspicious of this guy's motivations. Now, I'm no fan of Trump, but until he *actually* becomes a fascist dictator and/or condones/legalizes vigilante murders, I'm less inclined to trust Duterte going from one warzone to another. WOW much deal! And then he will kill them. This is sad. Come to our wonderful country where we accept all wirh open arms! Well except if you bring drugs, then we execute you. as long as they don't do drugs if refugees don't want to stay in france, why would they go to the philippines? Top Kek I'd like my chances better in Syria, I think.  That shit hole? I hope he knows Syrian passports can be bought on the black market for a few hundred dollars, now they gone up since he declared he'll take them in.  He better take the ones from registered UN camps only. Yes invite them so they can be kidnapped or extorted by your police. I think the refugees are safer in Syria.  he just dumped his bogus war on drugs because well over 7,000 were being killed here were not drug dealers.  He gave the ok to vigilantes to carry out his plans.  oops.  one day he hates Americans, the next he loves and is jealous of them.  wants American weapons, (actually anyone's as long as its free) but doesn't want American presence to train them.  ( although he secretly does).  I live here in the Philippines and have for 17 years.  grow up.  I know he was a lawyer who came up the ranks pretty fast but if you know this place, that just inst saying much.  kick backs, favors, family political influence...that is how stuff gets done in the philippines. This guy is in the news every week and I don't know who the fuck he is.  I'm interested in how it affects Duterte-Trump relations.  A muslim country accepting muslim refugees...someone page the rich oil countries in the middle east Hey man, it's not Duterte's fault they sprinkled crack on themselves. It's virtue signalling. Trump is now the bad guy and being against him makes you one of the good ones on the right side of history. People who hate Trump will now start tweeting about how open-minded Duterte is while ignoring all the shitty things he's done. Same thing with those who defended Fidel Castro after his death like Trudeau. PR was created to dupe certain people like yourself. Think Duterte cares about refugees? Unlikely. He wants to poke the US in the eye, gain some notoriety and brownie points from detractors. Works too, as you can see. lmao he's not don't worry The stats of the world is in good shape.. america is fucked.  Cause 14 bands are gonna play. No, when was that? The day we all forgot about North Korea? It's strange to call it strange > It is very strange that they are considering to accept Muslim refugees.  They aren't really/ This is the maniac governing regime thumbing its nose at the US.

Also I hope you realize that Muslim countries ALREADY take the vast majority of muslim refugees.... This is very easy to find information bud. One can applaud good actions of an otherwise bad person, and still recognize that person as bad. Stop drawing such stark lines in the sand. Castro was better than the American imperialists.  Edit: buttmad ameritards angry that somebody stood up to their asshole behaviour instead of letting themselves be exploited. Filipino here. The Philippines has always had [a culture of accepting refugees](http://www.rappler.com/thought-leaders/94664-rohingya-boat-people-philippines). I suppose that's just what happens when you're an island nation with 7000 islands -- you think every foreigner is stranded. Hah!  Since gaining sovereignty, the country has extended help to Jews, Iranians, Russians, Vietnamese, Koreans and recently the Rohingyas. Duterte will be rebuked if he even begins to take a hardline stance in immigration, much more if takes on refugee assistance. Well said, sir. And just for the record, I'm not duped, nor do I believe these articles. Just baffles me that this is showing up as a legitimate concern of his. Name the top five crazy leaders, GO!

So a Catholic country has done more for muslim refugees than most muslim countries... go seize the means back to the shire  *What universe am I in Morty?* \> Defending a man who [jailed gays for being gay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Cuba), [imprisoned political dissidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Cuba), and [restricts internet access to a degree only rivaled by North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_Cuba)  Yep, I'm on Reddit all right. Just a little confused on the last statement you made: so you think he will be rebuked for taking a hardline stance on immigration, or that he will be rebuked for being accepting? Ah right, well apologies then. Assumed you thought he was doing it out of the kindness of his apathetic heart. Kim, Duterte, Mugabe, Berdimuhamedow, Maduro. Yes but the aspergers population don't get jokes.  Life is literal. Lol just stop man you can't come back from looking that stupid. Lol we get it you're an idiot. At least stop. It's done more than the rich Arab gulf states, but Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon have taken in millions of refugees. Doesn't matter. You can breathe the air here, and the world is largely compatible with living, outside of a bad doner kebab.   Just do what the rest of us do & make the most of this universe you find yourself in. Enjoy the good times, get drunk at the bad times, and make the most of the cards your dealt.  Also, ignore that 2nd moon. It shouldn't be there. And liberated his country from the robber barons, and liberated from rampant imperialism, and gave his citizens free health care that is one of the best in the world, and mended the abhorrent levels of racism in Cuba by giving PoC equal opportunity, and housed all his people, and clothed all his people, and so on and so on. He's since apologized for the imprisoning of gay people, not that it really makes up for it.   Also it's not like America doesn't jail political dissidents either. Actually most of the time they shoot them or infiltrate their organizations and destroy them. Eugene Debs, Black Panthers (killing Fred Hampton). Slavery is also very much a fact of life for the prison population as well.  Just like a self-righteous westerner to only care about the most insignificant things.   Seriously.  I don't know enough about Castro or Cuba to comment about whether he's good or not, but there are a plethora of much more important criteria to focus on.  to poor people in 3rd world countries, do you really think they care about political dissidents or internet access? They need food and shelter. If their living conditions are better off now than before, then it was a success.   to point out things that don't fit your personal code of ethics and political views as a reason for why someone is 'bad"" is absolutely ridiculous. Haha absolutely not. Upvotes for you nonetheless. Is Mugabe crazy or just a dictator? What about Trump I would have put him after Duterte. How can Lebanon take in refugees when half of Lebanon are living in Australia as refugees? > and housed all his people, and clothed all his people, and so on and so on.   That's why the Cubans were risking their lifes escaping Cuba on rafts. Totally makes sense now. /s And there is also that thing about CIA operative Luis Posada Carriles, and the bombing of a Cuban passenger plane:   http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB202/  L. Posada Carriles lives happily in the U.S.    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Posada_Carriles   Are you getting paid for this? He liberated his country, jailed/tortured/killed all of his opponents, and suffocated freedom of speech.  What Trump is doing right now would be another day at the office for Fidel.  Don't know enough?  OK, no prob.  Here you go:  https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/11/26/cuba-fidel-castros-record-repression  https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/11/fidel-castro-s-human-rights-legacy-a-tale-of-two-worlds/ Before Castro destroyed the country, Cuba had a 1st world standard of living. Nowadays the Castro fanboys praise it for not being the worst 3rd world country in the region. Yes, the Cubans care about internet access and about political freedoms. They're not the primitive cavemen you believe them to be. He didn't jail gays for being gay, said political dissidents were often known for terrorist attacks, and he isn't restricting internet access, america does with the embargo. There's literally a very limited amount of bandwidth. We care I wonder if you feel the same way about Duterte. :\^) I'm pretty sure he expelled white people from the country and turned a blind eye when they were getting beaten and killed. He hasn't started slaughtering people...yet I hate that petty orange twat but he's not as bad as those five. Maduro is probably more corrupt and incompetant than crazy though. They can't. That's why there's been calls for other countries to hellp out. I think the narrative about them is that they were evil racist classist white kulak slaveowners or something like that. Totally. Soros is wiring me money as we speak. It's a great fucking job.   Of course there's no way that this could be a legitimate opinion of mine.  That lie is just insane. Castro overthrew a brutal dictator that killed more people in 5 years than Castro did in 50, under whom a tiny upper class brutally exploited the Cuban people. Regardless of how you rate Castro, absolutely no honest person will deny that he was a massive improvement over Batista.  >absolutely no honest person will deny that he was a massive improvement over Batista.  If this were the case, then you didn't have to spout nonsense like this.  Castro overthrew a dictator, yes. And took his place. There was no improvement. Castro's Cuba is the aids-free $5-brothel of the whole world. Except the US. Because embargo.

Indian villages have real shitty primary schools . There are no libraries , no qualified teachers . Thanks to the availability of cheap smartphones, free internet will encourage people(specially kids/youngsters) to explore the vast information available online. And that gives me hope .   P.S. - I am happy government got rid  of the Facebook Free Basic bullshit.    Access to the internet is a right equal to food and water. It's important because it gives people access to information immediately.   God damn, India has been kicking ass lately. Really hoping the US makes them a really close ally and starts learning from them. (Only the good stuff...it's wishful thinking) I know india has a long way to go, but I think they're going to take over as the leader of the free world.  Largest democracy in the planet and the us is going to hell in a handbasket while india seems to be making real progrssive progress. Every country should do this everywhere.  Can you imagine how incredibly beneficial that would be to the world economy? India's got way bigger fish to fry than village wifi.  Let's see how long it stays free with Ambani. r/indianpeoplefacebook is ready And soon will be linked to their Universal ID (Aadhaar). give internet for free, track every single move of the citizens.

I despise misuse of the word ""free"" like this. Obviously someone is paying, and that someone should probably invest in teaching them not to shit in the street before they graduate to WiFi.  India is weird.  You will see old men wearing lungis in straw-roofed huts watching soap operas on cable TV The comments on pornhub are about to get really interesting. But Toilets : thats the standard westerners quip... They should start giving them free toilets Yes that's what was needed in the villages, hmm..who needs water or other necessities. ShareBlue will be able to hire twice as many internet trolls. Probably have the same English skills, however. Na they won't. These are just election promises. We have upcoming elections in the largest and most influential state in the country.

One thousand villages.   > The 2001 census 72.2% of the population lived in about 638,000 villages and the remaining 27.8% lived in more than 5,100 towns and over 380 urban agglomerations. More Indians getting access to Youtube. RIP comments section. they are gonna open up some McDonalds and Starbucks? too bad the people who cant afford internet most likely also dont have computers. Seriously anyone saying India is some sort of superpower or future utopia of acceptance please go to India before you start spouting off about it they have a humanitarian crisis on their hands of epic proportions with the level of poverty in the country. most of these villages probably still have people pissing on the sidewalks, toddlers begging in the streets for change, air quality that is so poor you get asthma walking outside and cows eating trash everywhere BUT now they'll have free wifi-problem solved everybody!   Its not all beyond thunderdome there, the majority of Indians I talked with were intelligent, kind and made some fucking awesome food but the most basic infrastructures arent in place and most of these laws they pass never get to the implementation stage from what people have told me.  ....too bad none of those villages have any electricity.  damn..i knew we forgot something.. Maybe if you were paying out of your bank account, or perhaps your pocket, you'd have better luck.   Those villages will also have shitty internet. Remember that documentary where places would ignore the toilets they were given for free and just kept shitting in the fields and ditches? production of porn is banned in india given the relatively young population it might change  Don't worry we have Nukes. ;} This.

You should have bought stocks in /r/indianpeopleyoutube because that's where the actions is nowadays.  /r/indianpeoplefacebook has done growing. Low RoI.  and Porn too....  Steady there now. India has a centre-right government at the centre. They have mostly shown a laissez-faire attitude towards social issues but they are by no means ""progressives"". And they very much reflect the view of the majority in the country, do whatever you feel like but don't mess with our social fabric. > take over as the leader of the free world  good luck, India has a corruption index the same as China in 2016, and worse than China in 2015 and 2014 As an Indian... I doubt. They still can't figure out lines down a fucking road. You don't even need to come up with the idea, other countries have already done it, just copycat them!  The same country with Bollywood, WiPro, IIT can't figure out roads. They're still on their persecuting witchcraft timeline so they're at least 200 years behind.

[removed] Everyone knows Indians don't need water or necessities to live. The villages and everyone in them run on solar power and magic I honestly dont understand why you have so much hate for Indians  Is Pakistan really that much better than us on this issue or any issues concerning health? 95% of villages in India have been electrified.  The wifi is for alternate (and free) connectivity using cell phones which now have a really high penetration in the rural area. While only 70% of rural households are electrified (but 95% of villages are), cell phones typically can be charged elsewhere, and the phones used are mostly low powered devices that retain their charge for days together. No, this is the advanced wi-fi that doesn't need electricity.  That's a 15 year old census, since then they've added 300 million more people to their population and their GDP has grown from $500 billion USD to $2100 billion USD.  I would imagine a lot of villages would have been assimilated into larger cities amidst all that growth.  Since then the rural to urban ratio has changed to 70:30.  1000 is still a drop in the bucket, but it's a good pilot program that makes for nice headlines. The state run telecom provider (BSNL) while being utterly shit has already covered 200,000 villages with broadband, albeit shitty - 1 MBPS connections but with decent uptime in my own experience.  This is aside from 3g coverage which is saturated, yes you have pockets (idk, 10k villages?) that are remote and have next to no 3 or even 2g connectivity, but the rest have reliable 2 and 3g connectivity. Agreed but India is growing at about 7% and expected to reach 8% so   the rate of urbanization is extereme in India RIP your comment, downvotes coming Them fools again  What we tend to forget is that China was in the same state 10-15 years ago.   The growth rate is fuckin 7-8% and is expected to increase further to about 8.5%. The poor things you see today may be skyscrapers tomorrow. India has brought 125 million people out of poverty in the last 7 years alone. That's fuckin 3 times the size of UK being brought out of poverty in 7 goddam years. India's GDP today is exactly where China was in 2006(~2tn $). And India today is growing faster than China  250 million people almost 80% the population of US has gained improved sanitation since last 20 years.   Times change fast, and people who don't realize this get left behind > internet most likely also dont have computers.   Most of the users use smartphones to browse intenet and even more so in India. None=95+%  New math right here folks If we deny progress in the name of poverty, we would still be stuck in the 18th century.   Internet gives information and infomation is a basic requirement in 21st century. Using this info people move up economic and social classes therefore overcoming poverty and these issues. Get it? :) Like most countries, power is concentrated in the hands of rich and backward old farts.  No i don't think so. There was a parliamentary committee set up in 2013 to discuss the implementation of compulsory sex education. The members of the committee felt too embarrassed to discuss it on the very first day and subsequently it was scraped. With a conservative government in charge it's nearly impossible now.  We have just enough too. It was pretty strange. He tried to blitz the media with pro facebook-internet propaganda in an attempt to make the public put pressure on the regulators to go his way. In their report, the people who finally decided against it specifically noted that they really didn't appreciate the blitz and strong arm  tactic that facebook employed.   and that is a good thing The government is hardly centre right, if it is left of centre on economic policies while its parent org is definitely right of centre politically, the ruling govt has not made any moves on this front.  Granted though, no party in India (that wins elections) is progressive in that they will allow LGBT equality or stop with the utterly retarded moral policing.  However, we are seeing a progressive decline in socially regressive BS, the Elephant is turning, but it is slow and will take decades. You mean centre-right by Indian standards. BJP is centre-left by American standards.   Even then, I am calling them left only because of their socialist tendencies and not considering their conservative  religious/cultural leanings.   Most major parties in India are conservative on religious/cultural issues. Yes even the AAP.   They're more progressive than our left tho. The Govt may be Right or Left - the underlying Laws are all Left and anti-biz as fuck. And no Govt has the guts to touch these Laws. So the Govt may say anything India is generally a Left leaning country because that is what gets votes You can keep telling that to yourself, but this govt, is best we have got in years, yes they are supposed to be hindu centric party, but you cant lable them anti progressive, you can label them may be intolerant ( towards corruption and pseudo secularism )  Free wifi is very progressive! > no means ""progressives"".  Huh. Indian right wing means hindu that itself makes it progressive.   >And they very much reflect the view of the majority in the country, do whatever you feel like but don't mess with our social fabric.  Because for past 60 year only minorities were represented.  That means it's improving right?  As an Indian... I don't! Over Logging - South Park   >We invented the zero  B H A R A T  H  A  R  A  T The number of villages or small towns as you said where their is still no proper source of water is higher compared to those who got water but that to on days intervals and necessities like electricity is still not given properly. and you live in one of this villages, Right? get out of your imaginary bubble and see villages in other parts of India. Referring to that World Health Organization report that mentioned India had a disastrous issue with sanitary toilets.  India with 626 million people who practice open defecation, has more than twice the number of the next 18 countries combined; accounts for 90 per cent of the 692 million people in South Asia who practice open defecation; accounts for 59 per cent of the 1.1 billion people in the world who practice open defecation; has 97 million people without access to improved sources of drinking water, second only to China.  http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/monitoring/jmp2012/fast_facts/en/  You're right abou the villages but not the number of households, which is around 70% rural households. Here is the live data:  http://garv.gov.in/garv2/dashboard Really? 95%? Source? Retain their charge for days? I can't make it through a workday without being tethered to my charger.  All true, most notable the drop in the bucket. Given that copper and Strowger were the best you could hope for a generation ago, that's pretty profound progress.  Production of porn is banned but viewing porn is legal. Look at the entire country. Starving and famine in parts, yet they still won't eat cows. They're all over the place,  shitting all over the place. All that meat could cure malnutrition and feed so many, they have so many to farm it would never be an issue. They could focus on other problems associated with poverty without worrying about hunger and malnutrition. Yet where are the gods they pray to when their children are suffering, born with cleft lips, stunted growth, dirty water, no toilets, etc.? Their religion has significantly held them back.  Chill out dude, I'm pro-BJP. No party in India is ""progressive"", nor should they be. Its a specific ideology that pushes ever more egalitarian ideals down people's throat, even if they don't want it.  It has an economic motive behind it. Unlike the western nations, almost all rural economic activity is off the books. I think I don't need to tell you how bad it is for the masses: lots of cheating, no social security, no insurance and so on.   Wifi access will enable biometric based transaction, the government already has a database of almost all citizens under Aadhaar scheme. It'll then be easy for even the less educated citizens to carry out secure transactions with just a push of a thumb or an iris scan. most people who live in cities come from villages or small towns. So they have a pretty good idea.  The percentage is far worse in Pakistan though 593 million in China and 251 million in India gained access to improved sanitation since 1990.  China and India account for just under half the global progress on sanitation.  Those are 8 years old stats and I cant find any recent stats on the issue but I hope both India and Pakistan are progressing on this issue.  Once the village has a connection, it is a matter of last-mile connectivity, which takes a little more time.  https://scroll.in/article/759215/india-has-electrified-96-villages-but-is-still-far-from-taking-power-to-all-homes   after about thirty seconds of glancing over it, it seems just under 70% of homes have electrical connections, but 95% of villages overall are electrified.    If you're interested you're gonna have to look further yourself.   That's a caricature you are describing not a country.   Well first of all, there's no famine in India. Where did you get that? People are not starving due to a lack of food, but due to lack of access to them.   Second of all, Hindus don't look at cows as food. Would you eat your dog or your cat or your horse? What's so hard to understand. If you were served dog meat, you would find it outrageous and disgusting. If a Hindu was served cow, he would find it outrageous and disgusting. Cultural dissonance if I ever saw one.   Great comparison! India will go far. Sanitation + Wifi > Sanitation > Wifi.

"21",20,"5r4jc5","2017-01-30","This is worldnews?   As much as this sucks....this isnt worldnews.  This is a fake story and I will prove it.  Certain family courts like this in the U.K. are behind closed doors and are shrouded in secrecy (bad side to this, but not relevant here). It is a criminal offence to publish or even talk about the rulings (supposed to protect the children, privacy, etc.).  Ones that aren't shrouded in secrecy is when social services deem an adult unfit to be around children. Social services would never, and have never, put religion as a defence as it holds no weight in UK law and contravenes Human Rights laws.  Also if you bother to read the article, the judge says no direct contact, meaning only supervised supervised. This implies that the father can't be trusted by social services to be alone with the children in his care. The russian-owned newspaper Indepenent polarizing western society in whatever way it can manage. Yeah...the kids might just be a little bit confused. Totally wrong decision. It is more important for children to be in contact with their parent than to play good members of their community.  If their community gives them trouble for seeing their sex-changing dad, then it is not a good community for those children.  The judge simply made a political decision, totally ignoring what is good for the children.  Here is a better idea.. if a religion exists to persecute and humiliate others based on their race/sex then perhaps the judge can strike them down..  This is a huge travesty of justice. Unless the father poses a risk to the children he should have a right to spend time with them. Why didn't the judge order the woman to remove the children from such a oppressive and backwards evil cult? This is fucking disgusting. I would not have been at all surprised if this had happened in a theocratic shithole like Israel, but in England? No! You don't impose your religious laws in a modern secular country. If you cannot stomach British laws, GTFO. I don't care if you want Islamic or Jewish law, there is no place for religious law enforcement in a secular democracy. Britain should be deporting the people responsible for this, not pandering to them. Religion can demonise whatever they like. If it isn't compatible it isn't compatible. Their perogative. But in no way does their opinions or wants constitute law. The stupidity of religion strikes yet again! [removed] Would they do the same thing if she stopped keeping kosher?? People who voluntarily cut their dicks off is not exactly on the same level as the Civil Rights movement. Sorry, millennials. Well, if their faith says men will always be men, looks like it is wrong. Evidence vs old book...hmmm. It will be much bigger shock to the kids in an isolated religious community. Those people are not exposed to those aspects of the world or even to much milder things that we take for granted. So I think it is a good decision. When they are older they can make the decision themselves if they want to see him. [removed] Involves Jews being ""bad"". You know it's going to get bumped to the sub's front page, regardless of worldnews or not. Half of this sub isn't world news. Most of the top stories are ""Trump sucks! - says someone non-American"" If it happened outside America, it is world news, because America is the center of the world. /s   perhaps naming in which country this happened would help making it worldnews worthy Does it fit the narrative and agenda of the extreme liberal movement? Then yes, it is worldnews...  Anything saying Trump sucks is worldnews.   Anything pro-lgbt is worldnews.  Anything anti-israel is worldnews. Jews = news. The independent needs to be banned site-wide  It isn't even real news, it's fake news, the father was denied access due to sexual abuse on one of the boys.  Lousy tabloid paper known in the U.K. for fake news To me its only worldnews as an example of a liberal western country raping its own ideals in order to appease a radical religious group. Most such examples relate to muslims but here we see that it can also apply to extremist jewish groups (although they are much smaller in numbers).  The only question should be, ""are transexuals equal under the law in the UK?"" Had you asked most British people before reading this news story they would have thought that they were. But clearly, when push comes to shove and when religious fanatics cry about not having their backwards beliefs respected, the ""British"" ideals of egalitarianism and non-discrimination go out the window. Pretend it says ""transgendered woman denied seeing children at Catholic Church"" and you can start reeeeing.  https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/j-v-b-and-the-children.pdf  >These parents decided to bring up their children according to the narrow ways of the community, and they continue to agree about this. That being the case, the priority must be to sustain the children in the chosen way of life, preserving their existing family and social networks and their education. It is not to be forgotten that children have the right to preserve their identity (UNCRC Art.8), something that is a matter of particular pride to these children. Contact carries the clear risk that the children and their mother will become the next casualties in a collision between two unconnecting worlds. The father has already experienced the consequences of that collision, and no one knows better than she does how very painful they can be  -  >So, weighing up the profound consequences for the childrens welfare of ordering or not ordering direct contact with their father, I have reached the unwelcome conclusion that the likelihood of the children and their mother being marginalised or excluded by the ultraOrthodox community is so real and the consequences so great, that this one factor, despite its many disadvantages, must prevail over the many advantages of contact.  -  >I therefore conclude with real regret, knowing the pain that it must cause, that the fathers application for direct contact must be refused. I will instead make an order for indirect contact. **I see no reason why this should not take place four times a year for each child**  So much for your proof.  Not surprising that you received so many upvotes for saying something without any evidence.  edit:  >Also if you bother to read the article, the judge says no direct contact, meaning only supervised (contact).  I don't think that's what it means at all - otherwise it would be no unsupervised contact.  Other cases of indirect contact I can find mean writing letters to the children. This is a seriously misleading headline in any case. It's made to sound like some Jewish group made the decision against the transgender parent. According to the article this was decided by justice Jackson of the British Family Court. It said the only contact will be via letters four times a year. I don't trust your implications all too much, if the judge already went so far as to use the religious community as a reason to exclude the parent. Why wouldn't they make a ruling based on the real reason (hypothetical child abuse)? Correct. The Judiciary article says he was investigated for Child Abuse. ""D, then aged 4, had said at school in November 2015 that my daddy always takes his hand and puts it in my pants. This was reported at the time by the school to workers at the Federation of Jewish Services""   ....read the article. A court did order it.  About as confused as having two mom's or two dad's. Which is to say, not much unless they're *told* to treat it like a sideshow. By other people.   Kids adjust pretty easily since they don't have a lifetime of biases and prejudices built up. Unlike adults. Don't you think they might also be confused what ever happened to their dad?  Being transgender isn't as big a leap to understand for kids as it is for adults.  ""I reject the bald proposition that seeing the father would be too much for the children. Children are goodhearted and adaptable and, given sensitive support, I am sure that these children could adapt considerably to the changes in their father. The truth is that for the children to see their father would be too much for the adults.""  -Commentary by the judge. It's so very sad. So you agree with this? It's not that confusing.    How my brother and his wife explained our sister's transformation to their children:  ""Uncle Jeremy is a woman now, from now on you call her Auntie Jessica.""  ""You can do that?  ""Yup.""  ""Oh okay"" *proceed to go back to playing*  Grow the fuck up  Ideologically I totally agree with you. Do we sacrifice the child's welfare for the good of the ideology? I don't think so. It's a lesser of two evils but it is unmistakably evil. Even on an article that has nothing to do with Israel you waste no time in jumping to demonize them. Your shittiness once again shines through. > theocratic shithole like Israel,   ?  Israel has gay rights, is decriminalizing weed, has freedom of speech, petition, assembly, etc. It elects its representatives, and there are left wing, centrist, right wing, religious, and Arab members of parliament.  best theocracy ever. Who upvoted this garbage lol You said the opposite of what happened. The religious leader present (rabbi) argued against this. The judge made this call, not a religious institution. That *is* what is demonstrated here, seeing as the judge ordered this and the rabbi fought it.  Oh wait, that's totally the opposite. what? can someone explain  The 'they' in this story is the British judge in Family Court (not some Jewish group) who made the decision. So no, I don't think *they* would do the same thing if she stopped keeping kosher. Men ARE always men; no amount of surgery or hormone replacement makes a man not a man anymore. Do people not even read the headlines anymore nowadays? The article is about Orthodox Jewish people. Except that it doesn't. The transgender parent had orthodox jewish rabbis' testimony on her side during the trial. If anything, it involves the British legal system having a ""unique"" understanding of the hierarchy of human rights. Stop trying to victimize Jews all the time. Because... maybe Reddit is an American company with its headquarters in the USA???   I'm a flat earth believer person. And [this](http://norris.org.au/sail/maps/wm_amr_s1.png) map proves that the US is, in fact, the center of the world!!1!  /s This is why the world dislikes your country so much. I have always wondered how a country so big could have so little self awareness, then I run into people like you...  ""With Jews it's News"" Agreed, horribly misleading titles and clickbait and it still gets voted to frontpage  The Independent wouldn't publish the story. This is a trumped up fake headline anyway, read my other post in the thread that explains why.  The article also says he had allegations of CA waged against him (D, then aged 4, had said at school in November 2015 that my daddy always takes his hand and puts it in my pants). Which cannot have help matters when deciding the judgement. It really isn't misleading at all. Agreed if it's abuse to abuse. If it's religion it's religion. It's religion  >The mother, without much conviction, seeks a finding that the father touched D on his private parts in a sexual manner. The father seeks a finding that she has not touched D inappropriately. The Guardian does not support the making of a finding against the father.  -  >I will deal with the issue now. This allegation would not have been pursued by anyone if this hearing had not been taking place. It has not played any significant part in the hearing or in the professional assessments. Such statements as D has made are weak and contradictory and the process of investigation has been unsatisfactory from start to finish. **Having reviewed all the evidence, I conclude that there is no credible evidence that the father has behaved in a sexual manner towards D or any of the other children. So far as this court is concerned, that is an end of it**  The least you could do is read the judgment. The judge dismissed those allegations, and that was not the basis for the ruling. Also shows how anti-Semitic and bad the independent paper is. I don't think you know what Merlin Olsen looks like... Yeah true, you can teach kids a whole bunch of wacky shit and they'll believe it. Santa, the tooth fairy, a man magically being able to become a woman, etc. HA! Well my dad looks like Merlin Olsen....complete with his body type. So yeah, at age 7, and after I stopped laughing, I probably woulda experienced some serious PTSD. Just imagining that scenario scarred me a bit as of 5 minutes ago. I do. The judge is clearly passing this judgement with a heavy heart. It's the lesser of two evils to according to this judge.  When faced with any choice I choose the welfare of the child over the welfare of the parent. It seems the most humane. Yup, brainwashing kids is easy.  Well...I didn't drink Kool Aid that blindly when I was a kid. But hey, it worked for you. They both had 1, per order of the judge.  >It was her exwife that didn't want to allow it and the court sided with her.  Because of their faith / community would be disrupted by the father.  It's that simple.  >These parents decided to bring up their children according to the narrow ways of the community, and they continue to agree about this. That being the case, the priority must be to sustain the children in the chosen way of life, preserving their existing family and social networks and their education. It is not to be forgotten that children have the right to preserve their identity (UNCRC Art.8), something that is a matter of particular pride to these children. Contact carries the clear risk that the children and their mother will become the next casualties in a collision between two unconnecting worlds. The father has already experienced the consequences of that collision, and no one knows better than she does how very painful they can be  -  >So, weighing up the profound consequences for the childrens welfare of ordering or not ordering direct contact with their father, **I have reached the unwelcome conclusion that the likelihood of the children and their mother being marginalised or excluded by the ultraOrthodox community is so real and the consequences so great, that this one factor, despite its many disadvantages, must prevail over the many advantages of contact.**  [removed] They both had religious leaders there, per order of the judge.  >The judge made this call, not a religious institution.  Who said otherwise?  The judge's ruling was based on the reaction of the ultraOrthodox community.  >These parents decided to bring up their children according to the narrow ways of the community, and they continue to agree about this.

It's the filling that counts, not the candy shell. And it's about the judge who made the decision, despite the rabbi arguing that they should be allowed to see each other. You think people read the article or the title?  Ah, sorry - I was being mildly facetious; it probably would've been clearer if I'd said ""Headline seems to involve Jews being 'bad'.""  Imagine, for instance, if the headline said something like ""Court disregards testimony of religious authority, bars child from seeing transgender parent on grounds of 'incompatible' faith."" I doubt it would've garnered nearly as much attention. Ugh, orthodoxes.  I'm jewish myself, and I absolutely hate orthodoxes, they give use all a bad name -_- https://www.grammarly.com/handbook/punctuation/quotation-marks/8/quotation-marks-setting-off-specific-words-or-term/  https://i.imgflip.com/i84eq.jpg I was being sarcastic. I don't understand why the rule for /r/worldnews is ""anything outside America"" either. That's why you shouldn't run whilst looking/typing on your phone!! The size of the country is the reason for a lack of self awareness. I have to travel 341 miles to get outside of the US and the only neighboring countries I can drive to are mexico and Canada. The only reason I've even managed to travel to European countries is because I have family their to stay with and reduce my travel costs. You simply don't encounter much in terms of truly foreign cultures here in the US. Ha which is why we need a subreddit to provide us with more perspectives. The blind nationalism in the US is sickening, and the media here is divisive and filled with speculation and not enough verified information and outside perspectives. We're dumbing down our schools more and more, creating a bunch of people who lack critical thinking and world history. We're still good at sports though. Pretty sure America will win the world championship of Football again this Sunday. That'll make an unprecedented 51yr years in a row!!    For future reference, /s means sarcasm. Sarcasm is the use of irony to mock or convey contempt.  This is why the world dislikes your country so much.  I have always wondered how country like yours could have such poor reading comprehension, then I run into people like you... We are VERY socially aware. We are the awarest in the world. And soon, with TrumpCare we will be great again! I suppose, who needs freedom of the press when we can have self-imposed ignorance and censorship!  Banning is not the answer, ever. I saw this on another article too. Why are so many sources omitting the child abuse evidence?  >The mother, without much conviction, seeks a finding that the father touched D on his private parts in a sexual manner. The father seeks a finding that she has not touched D inappropriately. The Guardian does not support the making of a finding against the father.  -  >I will deal with the issue now. This allegation would not have been pursued by anyone if this hearing had not been taking place. It has not played any significant part in the hearing or in the professional assessments. Such statements as D has made are weak and contradictory and the process of investigation has been unsatisfactory from start to finish. **Having reviewed all the evidence, I conclude that there is no credible evidence that the father has behaved in a sexual manner towards D or any of the other children. So far as this court is concerned, that is an end of it**  Those allegations were dismissed by the judge, and were not a factor in the ruling. It is because child abuse was an issue. Read the other comments in the rest of the thread. Read the other comments in this thread, explains and how damning evidence can be inadmissible.  As you are not a lawyer I will explain.  A judge has to rule on weight of evidence and sometimes there is just not enough evidence or some is inadmissible (like a street camera filming you doing a crime in your driveway is inadmissible). Everybody in the court would know he is guilty, however some point of law has stopped the damning evidence from being considered.  The judge would find any way to still protect the children with center ground, supervised visits being one of them and find a reason to allow it.  I would never be a family court judge, too heavy on the conscience.  Kids are just more open minded about the world. Sadly, the same can't be said for you.  it all goes right along with the invisible man in sky Fuck off. You're seriously insulting anyone with PTSD here. Congratulations, you've reached a new level of mental gymnastics.   Most children would be devastated by not being able to see one of their parents, trying to spin this as 'the welfare of the child' is ridiculous.   A child have the right to both parents   The only thing that allows you to oppose it is when it's harmful for the child.   In this case I feel it's. More about the surrounding that needs to be educated.  Aka the Orthodox Jews in that community. As the transgender dad had a rabbi supporting him it's hard to see how that rabbi couldn't talk to that community to build acceptance.    I have a hard time understanding this verdict.   Tell me about it, just look at our society full of people convinced they need to police peoples genitals.   I think you're confusing drinking Kool Aid with not giving a shit.   To them it doesn't matter at all.  And that's a perfectly appropriate reaction because in reality it doesn't matter at all. The only people it seems to affect are those who have decided to have a problem with it.  If everyone just accepted it and moved on, nobody's life who isn't transgender would change in any meaningful way. Sure, gobble up the bullshit news outlets like Al Jazeera spout about Israel (like the time they reported Israel opened a dam to flood Gaza, when there is no dam there at all).    The best part is that you probably believe Israel is an apartheid state. Ever been there? Muslims, Jews, Christians, riding the bus togetherno, Muslims don't have to sit in the backsitting in parks together, at the beach together... you have no clue what things are like on the ground, obviously have a very selective media intake on the situation, and choose to believe what you read there. Foolish.  ....uh what?   Arab citizens in Israel have those same rights. Arabs serve on the supreme court, make up one of the largest parties on parliament, serve in the army, have the right to vote, etc.   And jews dont think of themselves as a master race. The concept of chosen people is chosen to do a duty of helping repair the world. There is no superiority aspect to it.  Oh, honey.. Both are pretty important. It's all good, I kind of saw that you were beng ironic. I just wanted to add something substantial to clarify for people who will get cut by Poe's razor everytime, irony tags or not. But the orthodox rabi said that the father being transgender is not something to punished in this way. The British courts are who made this choice without the support of the orthodox church.  Thats a pretty ignorant viewpoint given the many various sects of orthodoxy in Judaism....you should go to a chabad one day and see how it is. Most friendly and accepting orthodox bunch out there.  Cut the self-hatred BS, Orthodox Judaism is diverse as fuck and ranges from very progressive to very conservative groups People are people, no need to hate a particular group. But we also shouldn't accept the government giving anyone special privileges because of their religion.  Stop judging an entire group of people.  The rule is such because you can find American news all over Reddit without even trying.  The majority of Reddit users are American, as well, so there is a clear and understandable bias towards American events.  This sub is a place to find out news going on in or affecting the rest of the world, which often isn't as easy as it could be. Because reddit is based in the US and s large majority of users are as well? >That's why you shouldn't run whilst typing on your phone!!   unless you're running for president, because then it might actually work out surprisingly well  As an Australia I don't even have the option of driving to other countries.  There's a lot more than geographic size and border connections  going into the USA's perception that they are the center of the world.   Pretty sure Infowars is banned, should they be unbanned?  I agree with you, The Independent should not be banned, but the mods should remove misleading titles instead of clarifying the title with a tag. Because they were dismissed by the judge?  >The mother, without much conviction, seeks a finding that the father touched D on his private parts in a sexual manner. The father seeks a finding that she has not touched D inappropriately. The Guardian does not support the making of a finding against the father.  -  >I will deal with the issue now.

That pervert... > ""Having reviewed all the evidence, I conclude that there is no credible evidence that the father has behaved in a sexual manner towards D or any of the other children. So far as this court is concerned, that is an end of it""  The alleged child abuse was dealt with earlier in the court case and was ruled out of being a factor.   No it wasn't.  Read the other comments in the thread. >As you are not a lawyer I will explain.  You're not a lawyer either, so you can save it.  >A judge has to rule on weight of evidence and sometimes there is just not enough evidence or some is inadmissible (like a street camera filming you doing a crime in your driveway is inadmissible). Everybody in the court would know he is guilty, however some point of law has stopped the damning evidence from being considered. The judge would find any way to still protect the children with center ground, supervised visits being one of them and find a reason to allow it.  This is a crock of shit.  You have a blatant agenda here, and it's disgusting.  You might fool other people with this weak bullshit, but don't bother trying that with me. What point are you even trying to make here? tThat was completely irrelevant to mine. I understand it's ""simple shit"" for kids to understand transgender-ism, my point is that it's ""simple shit"" for kids to believe any mad shit at all you tell them, it's not because they oh-so-open and accepting unlike adults it's because kids are naive and ignorant, which is why they also believe in magic of other kinds like fairies and wizards. It's not difficult for adults to understand transgender-ism, and it's extremely condescending to say so (although you must be used to that.) adults don't go along with the mental illness you're pushing like kids do because they aren't naive and ignorant like kids are, not because they don't understand.  But it has to be this specific invisible sky man, there are invisible sky men that other people believe in but those are just made up.  No need to be rude. I'm sure you can appreciate the circumstances. If we assume the child would literally be ostracised by their entire family for access to their father then what choice do we have?  It's an awful spot to be in. Do we deny the father access to the child or deny the child access to their entire family?  It's not an easy question with no real right answers. Well...I don't know...yes? This is an extremely difficult question and being flippant about it is going to mean a less informed outcome. Surely you don't think you're able to adequately make a judgement on this case by reading a brief article?  In this instance I have to defer to the judgement the courts gave out. It's a very very difficult question to answer. There are no happy endings possible. Extreme individualists that don't care about the society and the behaviors happening in it are the roots of country collapsing.  Feel free to cut your dick, but don't push your fantasy on others, don't expect women to tolerate a man in their toilets, don't expect the society to let you adopt a kid (As you need to be sane for that).  The right of people stops when other's right begins. Kids are incomplete beings, they become complete by growing up. Therefore you can't use them as a judge to decide something.  Parents and education are here for a reason, if kids knew what is right from what is wrong at birth, we wouldn't need those. Gender theory BS is a danger for the social tissue, like not recognizing sick people from healthy one. If you think you're a female as a male, you have a serious problem.  Medias are tryharding at trying to change reality, the more the time goes, the less you'll find people that see still reality as it is. The majority will move on while the society goes retarded. No....I am equating drinking Kool Aid to accepting something as truth without questioning the rationale behind it. My definition is the correct one. I also don't really care about what you think ""normal"" is. Little me woulda thought my pops woke up thinking it was Halloween.  > like the time they reported Israel opened a dam to flood Gaza, when there is no dam there at all  Ah, you forget that they also printed a retraction of that story.  http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/02/gazans-flee-floods-caused-israel-dams-opening-150222115950849.html  > Ever been there?  I'm about as interested in visiting Israel as I am in visiting Syria and Afghanistan...not at all. Maybe when society will let feminine men just be feminine, they won't feel like they need to present as women to be accepted for who they are inside, then nobody will get surgery anymore. >But the orthodox rabi said that the father being transgender is not something to punished in this way.   And the other one said it is.  There were 2 rabbis, one on the mother's side, the other on the father's because the judge ordered it.  The mother's one is a member of their sect, the father's wasn't.  >The British courts are who made this choice without the support of the orthodox church.  Nope. It was done with support.  Multiple witnesses including a community support officer, 4-5 teachers, counselor, as well as random people in their community all testified.  example:  >""[The] children are regular visitors to my house. They enjoy a positive social relationship with my children and I assist with School rotas and general neighbourly duties.   >I can confirm that were the children in contact with their Father, I would not be able to continue this relationship as I would have serious concerns about the influences and information the children may pass on to my own children  Don't know why you're getting downvoted for this.  There were plenty of Orthodox Jews closely allied with MLK during the Civil Rights era, and plenty more who have adopted liberal/progressive causes today.  Very diverse range of political beliefs.  There are even Orthodox who are very openly critical of Israeli policy and pro-Palestinian.  Maybe people getting Haredi and Orthodox mixed up? ..you do realize orthodox judaism is synonymous with conservative to reactionary values right? Progressive judaism is called liberal judaism. And misogynistic as fuck Yeah, but this article seems rather hoax-y, unless the Independent is willing to face some pretty gigantic fines. They're not even allowed by british law to publish about proceedings like this. Idk about that guy, but I personally don't know how to do italics on my phone and I only look at Reddit on my phone. Both are acceptable; you just wanted an excuse to be flippant and obtuse.  Well, the other reason is we are the worlds most dominant superpower so things tend to revolve around what america does. Not saying its going to be that way forever (especially with such a ridiculous president tarnishing the office) but as it stands Trump can sway entire markets with 140 characters or less. Why are you asking me? I am not a mod or admin of this site. Also, just because Infowars dresses itself as ""news"" doesn't mean it is so. It's hardly conventional news, its more shock and fear spreading. Also, please inform me of a ""news"" corp that sells and advertises its own brand of ""Male Vitality"" pills?   Great reply. Thanks If you read the article, you'd see the reason the rabbi wouldn't let the kids see their dad, was because he was worried it would scar them or that the community ridicule would scar them. The point is that, likely the kids wouldn't have been scared (as you pointed out they're too ignorant to question it) and if it were community ridicule - that falls on the ""community"" not the father and not the children. A parent had her children taken away. There is no way that will be less difficult than the leap to understand that dad is now also mom - I'm sure any kid given the chance to keep their parent or never be allowed to see them again, would choose to keep their parent without condition. If you personally wouldn't - that's a personal issue with your ma and pa, and not something you need to foist onto strangers disguised as a religious belief. Man? I prefer the monster. >Do we deny the father access to the child or deny the child access to their entire family?  You don't deny anyone anything. The family should work it our for themselves, but at the end of the day the child should be able to see both their parents no matter what.  >what choice do we have?  Easy, you don't do anything. You don't separate a parent and child because some members of the family might ostracise the child. If the family members do that they're pieces of shit. It's their choice and you can't stop them.  >It's not an easy question with no real right answers.  Spare me your crocodile tears, clearly you either don't understand or don't care about the injustice, purely because ""oh well, the child's family might be dicks about it, better not risk it!"" > Extreme individualists that don't care about the society and the behaviors happening in it are the roots of country collapsing  This is total nonsense.  No historical precedent, no logical reasoning, just a bunch of words with no meaning.  >Feel free to cut your dick, but don't push your fantasy on others, don't expect women to tolerate a man in their toilets, don't expect the society to let you adopt a kid (As you need to be sane for that)  This is just hateful.  History will look back at opinions like this with shame.  Congrats on being associated with regressive, reactionary bullshit. > The right of people stops when other's right begins.  I agree, which is why your rights stop where transgender people's rights begins.  The right to use a toilet where they won't be harassed, the right to have a family, and the right to work/shop without discrimination.  Your ""rights"" to stop that don't fit anywhere in there.   If I were using my nephews as a judge to decide something, I would be out protesting early bedtime as a gross injustice.    Acknowledging they have an appropriate reaction to something is not the same as having blind faith in their moral sensibilities.     Dude, they're kids.  'Questioning the rationale' behind something isn't exactly the top of their agenda, except when it comes to why they have to eat vegetables and or why they have to do homework.    If something doesn't get in the way of playing with lego or kicking the soccer ball around, they couldn't give two shits about why or why not something is the way it is. Hooray, I'll bet the original made-up article got 10 times the number of reads as the retraction, if not more. In either case, just shows that a normally good news source abandons all sense of journalistic integrity to attack the Jewish state.    Well, no one is forcing you to go to Israel, but I will say that Jews and Christians, atheists, Buddhists, Hindus, not to mention gays and transgenders, have nothing to fear in visiting Israel, which might not be the case in Syria or Afghanistan.    Israel happens to be an amazing place to visit. You might find a trip extremely eye-opening.  > Ah, you forget that they also printed a retraction of that story.  I mean, that's better than *not* issuing a retraction, but *still...* No, no no not at all.   Conservative in the *religious* sense of preserving certain Jewish traditions, sure, but not in the political sense.  The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations, Yeshiva University, and the Rabbinical Council of America are all more politically progressive Orthodox groups.  And then there are the ultra-Orthodox. But even among them there's a huge range of views. Haredi tend to be more liberal for example. Stop judging an entire group of people. That could be that something damning was inadmissible. A judge also takes other routes when he knows someone is guilty but can't rule on the guilt.  He said the investigation has been bad, 99% of the time meaning mistakes in procedure by the investigators resulting in inadmissible evidence. An example could be a video of the abuse, but the way the investigators obtained it made it inadmissible, for example they took it from his computer without a warrant, bypassed his password without appropriate permission, etc.  Also notice the words ""as far as this court is concerned"", meaning according to the evidence the court were allowed to make judgement on. Haha wow you're really mad about this. It's a truly awful situation but the judge felt that the ostracisation of the child by the family was a reality, not a risk.  I agree, fuck them and fuck their bigotry but...saying fuck you to injustice isn't always the right move. We don't live in a perfect world where the right thing to do is always the right thing to do.  It's completely immoral to deny her father access and I still think it's the best thing for the child. It's a disgusting decision but one that may just be the right one. Yeah dude I hate the decision, I hate the entire situation. I just don't know what the answer is. It's evil either way. We have this horrible fucked up family and this poor dad put in an impossible situation. What's a greater crime? I'm inclined to let the child stay in what is very likely to be a much more stable than with the father.  I dunno man it's really sad and I hate to see these situations. Either way you're fucked. And you're just arrogant, you have no right to talk for history.  You seemed to be mad at me when I defend the right of women to have their own bathroom not invaded by men, and the future of kids to have a decent family.  You are right, how regressive and reactionary of me.  Medias and lobbies seem to have managed to brainwash you into thinking that thinking of being something grants you the right of being this something, above every logic and legality. How sad. And vice versa.  Sorry, I'm not in the mood for lame argumentation. Bottom line, I think that the West has started to recognize anomality as perfectly normal under the pressure of equality extremists and minority lobbies backed by pseudo researches that have too many unknown points to be reliable. What can I say? The kids you've been exposed to in your daily life might be a little more obtuse when confronted with that situation.  Do you consider Islamic fundamentalists to be misogynistic? Hehe you didn't deny being obtuse. It's all good.   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8tOsQv-rrEE Scientific research supports that gender identity is far more complex than what genitals your born with.  This is not a huge stretch of the imagination.  Google it.    All you have is assumptions and reactions.  So yes, you're regressive and reactionary.  It is also not arrogant to ask for historical precendent when you're talking about things like the roots of a country collapsing.  Burden of truth is on you for that one. Also, doesn't make sense.    I get the sense you don't put a lot of thought into your opinions. Maybe? Point is, I have actual experience with kids being confronted with that situation while you only have assumptions (I say with full acknowledgement of the irony that I am also making an assumption there).   I have no idea what an ""Islamic Fundamentalist"" is. Yeah exactly. The only point he does have is this is not settled (in how we should deal with it and treat it) and some people want others to act as if it is. This has stifled research and alternative ideas from professionals with decades of experience who do not agree with the prescribed narrative. This is clearly a complex issue but those pressing a discussion closed position only harden opposition and worse may harm those who have issues in this area when there might be alternatives if we can look more openly at it. Pseudo scientific researches and theories don't impress me, nor makes me regressive and reactionary.  Nature can fail sometimes, and people are thinking this is perfectly ok, when a fail is a fail. Some people are born handicaped, that's life, it sucks, deal with it.    Fallacy, I'm discussing of transgender, homosexuality doesn't bring the same issues. Not even talking about the young boy thing, seriously, I'm open to discuss with view I don't like but please stop with these.  0 risks doesn't exist, doesn't mean you have to take a chance with the most risky combos. I do answer normally if the argumentation makes sense. I do it on the very same thread. I'm not a native speaker so I'm lazy to prove you how you're using special form of argumentation to defend something that can't be. I'm sure there are some happy. Though I confess I have a hard time imagining someone happily living in the wrong body.   Now you're just deflecting and obfuscating.  My point stands  Pseudo scientific research like this: http://www.psyneuen-journal.com/article/S0306-4530(05)00045-4/abstract  Or [this?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20562024)  And this [crazy article](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/science-in-transition-understanding-the-biology-behind-gender-identity/article25553156/) cites research from the University of Vienna, the University of Washington, and the University of Amsterdam.  Total mills of crap science if you ask me!  You're right, definitely some wacko science going on there. /s  All from the first page of Google results for 'gender identity science'.  The evidence is out there, you'd rather just continue believing your assumptions because its easier.  It took me to have a transgender sister until I understood.  I was like you before.  But then my sister came out to the family - after the initial shock I went out and did the research and realized how horribly wrong I was.  I strongly encourage you to do the same, because right now society is destroying the quality of life of millions of people based on wrong assumptions.

"22",21,"5r47p8","2017-01-30","Wait til someone figures out his reddit username and other history.  Did the meaning of troll change when I wasn't looking? He didn't say edgy offensive shit because he enjoys watching people's reactions. He obviously believes very deeply in what he said What a piece of shit  Fucking terrorist  You aren't a troll if you believe those positions and shoot up a mosque.  The guy is an asshole and a terrorist, but not a troll. Did he post on 4chan right before he did it? Uh, I think he's past the moniker of ""troll"" at this point. I think both sides agree on one thing. FUCK PEOPLE WHO WOULD DO THIS SORT OF BARBARIC ACT. I think that's a pretty unifying message   It makes you wonder what the trigger is to make someone go from being just a random troll, to *actually procuring weapons and shooting people*.  That's a hell of a leap to make. I can see this post go up in flames very soon I went to /r/the_Donald to see what their take was on all of this and they had a thread in which they condemned the attack and talked about setting up a gofundme account for the victims to make sure people don't associate this guy with their cause...made me feel like there was a little hope.  Until of course I read the comments in which everyone just shouted about how it was a false flag operation funded by soros... The amount of T_D member asking not to judge them based on the actions of a single extremist terrorist, makes this all the more ironic. Reading the comments about this on facebook is just cancerous. You get the conspiracy theorists saying that this is all ocastrated by the government and media, the ""This is the will of the canadian people"", and the outright ""6 less would be terrorist dead...This guy should get a medal"". I really want to believe these aren't real people and just online personas. Yeah, don't fucking do this, it's terrorism, and fucking evil. It was disgusting to see the cheering on the Donald subreddit once news reports started coming in that the shooter was, wrongly, of Arab origin. Guess they'll never sticky that post that they were completely WRONG!  Shameful. Those poor, innocent people and their families. How horrid.  And the white house already managed to make a fool out of themselves. Great job!  He's a terrorist. Nothing less nothing more. All these right-wing members and racists, say that they're better in every way than foreigners and especially Middle-Easteners, and then they do this. There's shitty people in every culture and in every country, just because you were born in western world, it doesn't make your shitty actions justified.

He was from Maroc. His family was probably the first muslims to arrive in the neighborhood. At the time, we didn't know he was a muslim. In concrete terms, we told ourselves that it couldn't be easy to arrive at a new school and to know no one. We started to play together and we became friends. We listened to action movies of the 80s with Arnold and Stalone, we built forts, we played king of the hill on the snow hills.   >We didn't know much about what was a mosque or what represented Allah, but we learned that a muslim is someone like us. We didn't care about our religious differences. The important thing was our friendship, our common interests, the tricks to getting through level on the Nintendo, the time he backed me up in the schoolyard, the time I did the same.   >A lot of people on social media really think they know what a muslim is. ""They are like this or that, look at what is happening in Saudi-Arabia or with ISIS""  >When I was in third grade, I didn't know what a muslim was, but I think I already knew more than them.   >It isn't with the media that we learn about each other. It's by doing things together.    Edit: This is by Sol Zanetti, the leader of Option Nationale.  Definitely a slap to the face of those who claimed that the attackers were also Muslim. Let's hear your arguments now.  And where's Trump's commentary on this attack? Definitely would have boasted about how smart he is if they were an extremist. Fuck this guy, he deserves to rot  So: Dylann Roof - radicalized white racist entered a place of worship and killed innocents. Found evidence of him in specific online communities.  Alexandre Bissonnette - radicalized white racist who entered a place of worship and killed innocents. Found evidence of him in specific online communities.  Somebody better be taking a serious fucking look at this. Enough has to be enough. where are the leaders of the alt-right denouncing him?  edit: Amazing the response from the alt-righters here - they're all just excusing the lack of condemnations from their movement.  If you want people to trust you, you need to work harder at preventing terrorist attacks and make it clear to everyone you oppose violence. He's not a ""troubled alt right"" he's a FUCKING TERRORIST.  The alterNazis have already decided this is a cover-up. What the fuck? Ummm..../r/the_donald? Is that you? Perfect description imo.  Edit: to all y'all criticising me or the message: you are right, this is the sort of behavior which we need to avoid in order to grow together again. Instead of pointing the finger at one another, we should take each other's hands and try to make the best out of the worst. I will try to not let my comments be full of agressive rhetoric towards groups of people, generalising them, because it will help nobody and will make the situation worse. I will not delete the message but hope that people read this edit. So t_d has a subscriber base of 300,000+ and spammed the mega threads so adamant about it being violence started by a Muslim extremist, but now the truth comes out and they cry about the simple fact that the guy liked Trump? Can someone remind me who the snowflakes are?  God damn this world is so polarized it's sad. Makes me wanna just completely ignore the internet... you all are freaking out on all fronts. So he was definitely on 4chan and probably on this site too No surprise. Justin, can we turn away right wing nutjobs at the airports now? Terrorism isn't just Islamic. It comes in all creeds and colors.  r/the_donald prematurely claimed it was a Muslim refugee who did this, when it was actually someone from r/the_donald, literally ... How, and why, are we still debating on calling him a terrorist? He **is** a terrorist. Stop with the semantics and face reality.  What was that Chris Rock line from you one of his comedy specials? I ain't scared of Al Qaeda, I'm scared of Al Cracker? Hey now, on behalf of all trolls, I do not wish to be associated with this guy. Most of us are moderate, in order to maximize the number of people we can troll.  Sound like he is a member of the alt-right.  Yet, I'm sure we'll still see people claiming that the terrorist was a Syrian refugee. So, the first act of terror in North America during Trump's presidency was perpetrated by a Trump supporter.  Where does this fit into the immigration ban? Woah woah let's not make sweeping generalizations here, at least he's not a muslim /s Time to put a ban on Canadian immigration till we ""Figure out what the heck is going on."" GEE FANCY THAT As a Trump supporter this is not acceptable and shouldn't be swept under a rug, violence against innocents should never be defended or minimized no matter the affiliation. Fact is there are sick people from every corner of the spectrum, we need to improve our respect for one another. We need to recognize and report our friends, neighbors, classmates, coworkers, and online peers that preach hate and have been radicalized just like any other community should.  Horrible act, that shows Terrorism has no religion or race.  But people, let's not use him as a brand for all far right people or Trump supports regardless of our feelings for them. He was a radical extremist from their group.   If we clump them all together, well be as bad as those who clump all Muslims together for the Islamic terrorists - and hypocrites. Don't bother reading any of these comments. In the wake of this terrorist attack, one thing is clear: Canada desperately needs extreme vetting of Trump supporters.  If Canada had a registry of suspected Trump supporters and ensured they could not buy guns, six innocent lives would not have been lost.

We're never going to stare down those we simply can't see eye to eye with and realize there is no need to belittle. There is no need to rain down upon our enemies with an artelliry of Facebook statuses.  Not because they aren't wrong (they very well might be), but because unless you take a gun to their head and murder them in cold blood, they aren't going anywhere.   You don't love thy neighbor because he is a saint of a man, worthy of every ounce of appreciation you can muster. No, you love him because he is permanently settled into your life.  We've all established we don't agree. We know exactly why we don't agree. If we continue the current trend of trying to take meaningless jabs at each other our lives will only deteriorate.  Our differences won't disappear, we, as a society, obvioisly aren't willing to budge on political issues.   This new found sense of division in America isn't going to alievate over night unless we change how we discuss the single most important aspect of our lives.  I refuse to believe I'm the only one aware that our nation is, almost willingly, stuck in stagnantation while we point fingers at each other. Killing innocent people is the lowest of the low. Political beliefs aside this guy is an asshole. Burn in hell bitch you don't represent us.  Shocker   /s Color me *surprised* /s It goes without saying but I'll say anyways : as a Muslim,  I know not every French canadian is a piece of shit like that dude.   Edit: sorry it's 4 in the morning and I am tired as shit As I can't seem to find the answer anywhere. Did this young man conduct this despicable act in the name of any of the following deities?   1. Buddah 2. The flying spaghetti monster 3. Vishnu 4. Lono 5. Thor 6. Odin 7. Our lord and saviour jebuz christ  Or was he just a grade A right wing nutter? anyone have a link to the article calling him a ""lone wolf""?... NO. HE IS A TERRORIST. I'm so pissed and cynical these days that honestly I see the light in this story. Fuck you you fascist fucks. You guys own this piece of shit. He is the result of your rhetoric and hate.   But then I also realize that this shit is getting scary. World War I started because 1 guy (yes, he was royalty) from friggin AUSTRIA got killed and the world had itchy trigger fingers.  This is getting scary. Conservatives wanted instability and they got it. The world is a bigger place than America. It's hubris to think otherwise. Ooh wait he isn't Muslim so he isn't a terrorist. -_-  Just some random guy who decided to go shoot people. No big deal, right? Probably isn't even CNN worthy. Sarcasm.  [removed] Alright. So this is where we're at. Everything bad that happens has to have some tie to Trump now? I couldn't care less either way about him (even though its quickly turning into a lot of questionable decisions), but its so tiring to know that every time I open Reddit it's just gotta be another story about how he has to be connected in some way to every single bad thing. Guess that means we add Canada to the list?  Has Trump and his followers condemned the terrorist act yet? You know, like ordinary muslims has to do every time ISIS kills people.. /r/The_Donald has already called him a terrorist, but there are the usual ""but muh false flag"" in the comments of that post.  Did Trump acknowledge and condemn the attack publicly? Don't try telling this to the people in r/the_Donald ... Got insta-banned for correcting people who were saying it was a radicalized Muslim man, apparently they want to stick with their alternative facts What, we are not going to spin the story this time, like with the fake homosexual in Orlando? This guy's problem was obviously being secretly muslim. FOX News is going to call this guy a leftist.  I guarantee it. In America here are the key media words for white terrorists: -troubled lone wolf -anti-Muslim activist -pro-life superfan -fanatical death bringer -just a nice boy He was a right-wing Trump supporter? I'm shocked. SHOCKED. Next you're going to tell me he read Breitbart.  Hey Trump supporters. How does the fact that Spicer used this as an example to legitimatize the ban on letting Muslims into your country make you feel? Like, explain to us how exactly this makes sense. Based on his actual words, and not based on what you think he was ""trying"" to say. I'm not trying to be a dick, I just can't see how he could in good taste, or with any sense of real logic use this event as an example as to why they're doing what they're doing.  What we need right now is a ban on Trump supporters. A complete Trump Ban to Make Canada Safe Again. Trump true believers know who these people are in their community.    They have to help law enforcement. Sadly, I expect to see more White Far Right Wing terrorism. Millions of them don't trust facts or science and see Trump's Twitter feed as gospel.  Trump voter here. Fuck this piece of shit terrorist. If there is a hell, I hope he burns in it. I'm pretty sure Canadian law enforcement is on that as well as other things. Can't wait to read his /r/the_donald posts. The instant it happens his account will be locked and hidden from view.  The reddit admins like to keep up their little fantasy that this kind of racist violence doesn't originate here, and they will go to the ends of the Earth before they acknowledge how much damage they've done by letting subs like /r/the_deplorables get away with violating every single rule they claim to have. r/metacanada they are coming for you  He *was* known as a troll by his peers.  Obviously now he's known as a mass murderer.  >Any community that gets its laughs by pretending to be idiots will eventually be flooded by actual idiots who mistakenly believe that they're in good company.  -Rene Descartes  Replace idiots with nazis, same thing He would likely harass people to get an emotional reaction out of them(typical sociopath.) Then bathe in the ""tears"" of their reactions.  Most younger generation bigots will hide behind the farce that they're ""just trolls"" so that they can't be called out for being racist.  While some people are legitimately 'just trolls,' many actual bigots use it as a defense.  Like the youtube 'prank' channels.  No dood, what you're doing isn't a prank, it's assault. ITT, people are seriously saying stuff like  *what, should we put all of 4chan on a watchlist?*  *Not fair to generalize everyone on T_D like this.*  *Media's going to try to portray all online ""trolls"" as terrorists now*   congratulations. Now you understand a hint of how muslims feel in the west You're missing how troll culture and the far-right have mingled on the Internet. Many of these people genuinely do believe what they're saying, and they also enjoy watching people's horrified reactions.  People who very deeply believe in the edgy offensive shit they say often pretend to be trolls when called out. See: /pol/, /r/The_Donald. These last couple of years have brought to light how a lot of what we (people outside of the alt-right) used to perceive as ""trolling"" could have been a lot more sincere than we thought. This is one extreme example of that. Like ""fake news"" (unpopular reporting of facts), apparently ""trolling"" is getting a makeover to suit the narrative.  The news will go pretty far out of their way to not call Nazis by their proper names  When I gave an update on the threat on worldnews in the immediate aftermath of the attack, a number of commenters below me took to a few rumors that both attackers were Muslim refugees and were rejoicing, laughing at liberals, etc.   I understand that this place has a lot of people who despise people of different political leanings, but the lack of humanity and treating everything as a game where you're ""winning"" depresses me. You can say that again. Agreed, no matter his ethnicity this 100% makes him a terrorist  It's weird to see how here in Canada, we'll label something terrorism right after it happens, while in the US, everyone waits to see what ethnicity they are before they use the word. And if they are Muslim, they wait for a motive.   I remember a ton of people saying the Orlando shooting wasn't terrorism because the guy wasn't part of ISIS, or that he was gay and taking out his shame on club goers.  Say it with me: **RADICAL ANTI-ISLAMIC TERRORISM** He was a troll, but last night he became a terrorist.  Why do we need to defend trolls though? Spouting positions held by people that shoot up mosques should not be considered a joke. People spouting hate speech need to be held accountable. The whole concept of trolling is an indefensible one.  I saw a Canadian asking what the best time to ""Demonstrate"" at his local Mosque was. But then again I'm just a humble shitposter so I don't now if its related  ""You hajis are pretty alright.  Don't go to mosque tonight.""  Hah just kidding, like he would ever think Muslims were ok What's his Reddit user name? I want to go l check out his posts on /the_donald. Just a prank bro. Le trolololololo.  Waldo for Prime Minister. I would LOVE if this could be the case. So many current events should result in such a way. Unfortunately though, I'm from Indiana, and I can guarantee people from the small town where I went to high school and even some of my family members would laugh at the death of these ""sand n*ggers.""  You would think that, but you would be wrong, unfortunately. I don't know what planet you've been living on, but there are plenty of people who support stuff like this. The trick is that the people most susceptible to this can jump that threshold a lot easier than you or I. Where we might confront one of those intrusive thoughts - ""Maybe the world would be better without any Muslims in it,"" - and just go ""What the hell, brain?"" people like this go ""Sounds about right, and I've got next week clear, anyway."" Well if a troll is only spouting hate speech 24/7 with a bizarre sense of superiority and detachment from reality then this would actually follow on quite sensibly. A lot of ""trolling"" these days is border line terrorism anyway. We call doxing and harassing people till they commit suicide trolling. When did it become ok to intentionally try and hurt people but then claim you didn't really believe it to make it ok. Doesn't that make it worse? If you look at places like /r/altright, these people are so hateful and radical, I don't think it's that big of a leap. More like a logical conclusion of their ideology. I hear reddit is a fair and open site that will take all the facts into account when making up their minds.  Thank you.  I felt like a total cunt for thinking-  ""Really? Really? One whack job doesn't represent all Trump supporters, but one whack job represents a group of 1.2 billion people?""  Mostly because I am sick and tired of being expected to apologize for, or comfort non-Muslims that I am not *that* kind of Muslim. While the Kansas Crusaders, Tim McVeigh, and all the other white, American, right wing, whack jobs don't represent all white, American, right wingers. This is ridiculous. Those dead were the Canadian people. Communities are given value by the collective members of that community. Those killed were teachers, neighbours, fathers, and friends. The shooter made the country poorer. My MP is a Muslim refugee. She doesn't make our riding weaker or lacking. She makes it stronger and better for all of us.  I just went to the_cheetobenito, and one of the posts rejected the outright facts, called it fake news. Another commenter said it was ""liberal propaganda"" Oh my god I've never wanted to punch my computer more. How can so many people just outright deny basic facts? I just don't get it. It's not just Trump supporters. Just generally all right wing idiots.  In Melbourne, Australia a couple of weeks ago, you may or may not have seen that some guy drive down a pedestrian road and ran over 20 odd people, killing 6 (strangely enough, it didn't make the /r/worldnews front page).  There were people on Twitter and Reddit claiming he was an ISIS operative, Muslim, etc. There was even an eye witness tourist interview claiming he shouted Allahu Akbar.  Turned out to be a Greek drug addict.  After his identity was revealed, there were still idiots claiming he was Muslim, despite there being zero evidence of that being communicated through any official channels.  It just goes to show, right wing flogs will never let the truth get in the way of their agenda.     If people on the_donald are happy/sad after the confirmation of an attacker's ethnicity, then they are not decent and not helping our culture.  This goes for the left as well. What did the White House say? I haven't heard anything. It's going to be difficult to get used to the name ""The White House"" being attached to dumbfuckery like this.  A friend in Turkey once told me she was only Muslim because that's what the rest of the world says she is, but she's never been to a mosque never read the Quran. She knows more about Christianity than she does Islam.   It's amazing how their is an ignorant view of people who originate from countries where Muslim is a majority, they think everyone is Muslim and practice but they are not.  This isnt a battle won. Codemn supremacy from everyone. If some white dude says ""death to muslims"", then condemn them. If sharia law says ""death to nonbelievers"", then condemn them. Why the fuck is this a competition for any rational person? They'll use Trump's tactics  ""We never said that"" Have you noticed the posts about this are curiously empty of alt-right chucklefucks? Most of the time /r/worldnews is full to the brim with them, but even they realise they can't spin this one. Ban people from majority white countries from entering the US! The irony is that they're almost exactly the same as radical Muslims who commit mass killings. They're isolated, lonely male losers, every one of them.  We need better vetting procedures. ^^/s I read some places where alt-right people post, and they are debating whether the Trudeau government just accused a random white person or if this guy is some kind of progressive infiltrator.  As far as I can tell they are not at all happy with this and are going tinfoil hats ahoy to distance themselves from it.  To the ""alt-right"" he's probably more of a freedom fighter. Obviously, only Muslims can be terrorists.  What are you talking about? He did exactly as they commanded! ""You're doing God's work, son"" is more along of the lines of what they'll say to him. It's 50:50 right now. Half of them says it's a cover-up, the other half says it's a false flag. They're a delusional hate group, this is par for the course with them. I love how their front page is devoid of this revelation. The only good discussion you'll find is in old posts that still sarcastically think the shooter is muslim.  I love how people are pointing out their hypocrisy in their subreddit. There are people asking them to sticky a post and denounce the action of a crazy shooter just as they demand the Muslim community denounce crazies in their communites.  There are people asking for a a ""temporary ban"" on Trump supporters just as Trump ""temporarily banned"" people from other nations. Because to Trump supporters, it's okay to paint an entire group of people with a broad brush and hold them all accountable for the actions of a few.  Loving it. It's a plant from Hillary, she did it like she did the pizza pedos  /s  With the amount of spinning and denial from TD we could stop the heat death of the universe from happening.  /r/metacanada is the sub you're looking for. Naturally, they're going to respond with outrage that anyone could have seen this coming from a mile away. They'll be happy to tell you that it's this kind of prejudiced attitude towards White racist shitheads that made Donald Trump so appealing.              https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5r4q7f/we_at_rthe_donald_condemn_the_quebec_terrorist/?st=IYKZU3M4&sh=b06d0a12 It's like poetry, it rhymes. They'll just scream false flag Right wing nutjobs don't tend to fly to other countries too often.  I mean, Islamic terrorists are just as much right wing nut jobs as neo nazis are.  True of course but if you're living in a place like Paris or Brussels or most cities around the world, it is by far the biggest terroristic threat. Let's not be naive about that and underplay its magnitude and pervasiveness. Y'all Qaeda? >Fact is there are sick people from every corner of the spectrum, we need to improve our respect for one another  Exactly.   We should be working together, not trying to kill each other.   I think the people doing that are just doing it to throw the ""logic"" that those folks use for Muslims right back in their faces.  It's clear they can't take it, either. When something like this happens and it's a Muslim it's just normal Muslims being Muslims. But when this happens and it's a white right-wing extremist it's gotta be something more elaborate (conspiracy, cover-up, etc.). It's a fucking joke.  That being said, if we're going to take steps to protect us from radical islamists and other extremists, why are we not simultaneously taking steps to protect us from these crazy assholes? Or, better read, why aren't we taking steps to protect us from ALL extremists, regardless of skin color and religion? People seem to forget that last line a lot. Trump supporters are allowed to all be evil because some are but no other group is, or so some would have you believe.  what are the odds the usernames of two consecutive comments are fuckinghighelf and elvenrulelord But I've already buttered my popcorn... I agree no one should be cheering for a killer to be particular race or religion. Thank you. I'm about to quit reddit entirely, or at least leave for it to cool down. This month has been insanity.  Join me in the middle. There are dozens of us that get shit on by both sides for daring to see the good and the bad in each side. I'm happy you're here, because it's not patriotic for Americans to feel we can't talk to each other.  But this is the hate many felt the Trump phenomenon led to. This is a tragedy - but how many people grew more angry and mean spirited as a result of his campaign?  Fuck terrorists of any color or creed. But it's unamerican to hate their victims. And there are many more victims than radicals. One of the best aspects of this situation is that he's alive and apparently cooperative. That means they'll be able to get a pretty complete picture of his radicalization process.   If this was the US, I'd have to imagine he'd be in a body bag and we would know so much less about the situation.  Probably sprinkled with some /r/altright too  The worst possible result of Poe's Law  Exactly this. Anders Breivik, the Norwegian far-right extremist that killed over 50 people was exactly that. A 'harmless' internet troll. He didn't belong to any far-right groups or constantly meet up with people of the same ideology. Everything that he did developed online.   I read the book about him called, One of Us. Echo chambers are extremely dangerous. When you surround yourself with people who agree with your extreme view points it gives you the impression that you're right especially when there's no one to challenge those views.  > Obviously now he's known as a mass murderer.  I think you spelled *terrorist* wrong. He sounds a lot like many redditors. If he actually believed what he was spouting than he wasn't a troll, he was serious.   ""It doesn't matter what bullshit quote someone puts on the internet, somebody, somewhere, is willing to believe it came from a famous figure.""  -- Jesus of Nazareth And this is exactly what has happened with /pol/, the joke has gone too far because the idiots thought the joke was serious. Do you happen to know the original wording of Descartes passage above? Yeah not sure if it applies here or not, but there has been a huge number of people during this past election cycle that have started to use the term troll to refer to people who genuinely hold offensive positions. That's not what the word means. Well, these days they also say things like ""you're the racist for calling *us* racists, and it's not our fault you don't understand us!"" There is an awful lot of doublethink and doublespeak going on... Exactly - the YouTube pranks involving assaulting women or going into the 'hood' and hassling black guys who are just minding their own business being prime examples. Ugh. Trolltrace is going to happen sooner or later.  RIPERONI BOYS good point.  most people hate being grouped with the extremes but do the same for Muslims.   >*Not fair to generalize everyone on T_D because of this.*  Oh, but it's fair to do it to Muslims? Sack up, you fucking little bitch Trump supporting special snowflake safe space needers. I'm shocked anyone from T_D would even acknowledge this as a non-alternative fact. I'm pretty sure they have declared this to be either fake news or a conspiracy already. Right?  We should keep it up, keep painting them all with the same big brush, then when they complain, point this out. I hope T_D gets taken off this site.  I'm done with them. You can almost always find the word ""deplorable"" somewhere on their twitter handle or profile.  They're the Evil Clown. Be evil, then say ""aw I was just kidding"" when someone calls them out on it. Because bullies are frequently also cowards. As a consequence I have literally no idea how much of /r/The_Donald (and Trump supporters in general) are trolls, vs. genuine believers.  Trolling should have never even been an excuse. If you act like something, you are that something.  There's a fundamental difference between the sides. The right wanted it to be a Muslim so they can continue demonizing *all* Muslims and keep pushing for further collective punishment against innocent Muslims who had nothing to do with it.  The left wanted it to be a white guy so the rabid people above realize other people can be terrorists too, and if they don't want to be punished for something they didn't do, they shouldn't try to do the same to others; and maybe they should learn some empathy.  The motivations between the two sides couldn't possibly be more different and really points out the difference between the right and the left. The right is all about hurting other groups in different ways (whether Muslims, poor people on welfare, immigrants, etc), while the left is about bridging differences and being tolerant. What a piece of shit No matter anything, except his actions, makes him a terrorist  What the fuck does ethnicity have to do with being a terrorist?  Oh that's just because we're broken. It's terrorism if it is politically motivated. So if someone shoots up a school and just says they're angry or just wanted to kill people, then that's not terrorism. That's just a sick fuck killing people. If they shoot up a black church because they're racist or if they blow up something to wage jihad, then it's terrorism. You see how that works?  > we'll label something terrorism right after it happens  Terrorism requires a specific intent. Unless the attacker makes their intent immediately obvious then you should always wait before calling something terrorism. They tried to push the ""self-hating closeted gay homophobe because he was oppressed"" angle SO HARD when it happened.  It was honestly disgusting.  The editing out his ISIS and Allah pledge during his 911 call was sick. Trolling is about baiting people with wild incendiary comments that you don't actually believe in. If ruffling feathers with things you actually believe in, you're just an asshole. Which is separate from a troll. Trolls do it for the attention.   Extremists do it because they believe they have to. That guy came back to the thread to post later, after the suspects were already in custody. It's not him. The shooter probably went completely ignored because he's A FUCKING LEAF Oh man, we'll see I guess. But it really sounds kinda messy if you ask me. [removed] Nah.  He's also a /nofap/ adherent.  /r/blackmirror Fuck, I hate when a single redditor's personal anecdote completely disproves my understanding of the world.   The majority of people in my mid-sized upstate NY community are Republicans, and I've met maybe two or three people in my entire life that would ever use that kind of hateful language. My parents are Republicans and couldn't be more thrilled when my sister's flamingly gay Pakistani hairdresser & friend comes over for drinks...which one of our anecdotes is right?  Ah, that's right. The truth inconveniently lies somewhere in the middle, like always. I'm hoping that it leans closer to my experiences, for our country's sake. I think it does; I still have faith in the average person  Idiots are everywhere.  News at 8. Did you grow up on my hometown? I've seen people celebrate Muslims dying before. They're not us, why care? When I was in college I remember a guy who had almost failed out of high school tell me ""Hell yeah I would kill someone, Ive got nothing else to lose at this point"". To me that was insane to hear, but in reality thats probably a lot more common than any of us would believe. A minority of all people are mental and not helping them does us more harm than them.  That's one of the trickiest aspects of the freedom of expression people like to defend in the US, they often mock Europe for punishing people who get caught for holocaust denial, defamation, insult, racism, call to hatred, call to violence or who openly support terrorism (though, apart from the terrorism thing, it's not really enforced unless you're a public figure or get caught up in some controversy that makes the headlines) but, while there are negative to our hate speech laws, I think a lot of people underestimate how much influence speech can have on people's actions.  99.99% of people who get a kick flaming or trolling people online, who openly call to violence against Muslims might not actually *do* something about it and are harmless, they might act like dicks but they aren't that different from your average racist not exposed to internet propaganda, the problem is it reaches so many people there'll always be someone, somewhere who will get stuck in this echo chamber and get more and more radical as the only opinions he sees are other racist dicks like him and who will end up thinking violence is somehow a-okay.  Same with people who beat their SO or are prejudiced towards women, some communities on reddit are downright scary and there's no way it doesn't have a negative effect on their view of women. What is that subreddit about? They are praising hitler (he did nothing wrong; the axis were the good guys; humanitys best friend) and think that ""oven dodger"" is an awesome insult for jews. Is it supposed to be some kind of satirical thing? Are they serious? I thought that the alt-right is trying to distance themselves from neo-nazis and always claim they aren't. That sub is definitely not doing that. What the shit? And then you got on Reddit.  Surely nobody will equate this guy with all people that fall to the right of the political spectrum. /s > While the Kansas Crusaders, Tim McVeigh, and all the other white, American, right wing, whack jobs don't represent all white, American, right wingers.    Now you get it, welcome to Western logic. None of our ancestors' crimes against humanity are ours, but all of the land they took, is. People are scared of what they do not know.  That is why, in my honest opinion something like the Erasmus Program is so important.  By bringing people together, it is much more harder in the future to feed them bullshit and convince that ""that group over there!"" of different looking people, from far away lands who speak a language you do not understand and who you **never** met before are somehow the evil-masterminds of everything, that is wrong in this world.  The emotion, upon which Donald is capitalizing, is nothing more than a grown up version ""mommy I am afraid of the dark"". The darkness isnt scary, it is what we do not see that fuels our imagination and our fear.  I am willing to bet, that the majority of people who are so concerned about Islam, are people who never mt a single Muslim in their lives and probably never will. Similarly how USA residence think for some reason that Europe became somesort of caliphate, even though they never been to countries like Germany or France, and are only aware of the situation in those countries through their local news station. They learned that when there are enough of them, they can simply create their own reality from scratch. It's the internet and it's just like the real world. You have people that truly believe in something and people that want to watch chaos.   A majority of the people denying are trolls/baiters/etc.  They are extremely fragile and cannot let even one ounce of counter evidence in. Hence the mental gymnastics. They're in a cult. Nothing gets through to them. It's conspiracy on top of conspiracy. Ask them about the crowd sizes at the inauguration (which no one cares about)? Another conspiracy. They're delusional idiots, that's why. That post made it to the front page. I remember seeing it while browsing r/all I actually ended up submitting it to /r/topmindsofreddit and AHS when it happened so I have the link. [Here is the post.](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5p84dv/guys_we_need_to_get_the_truth_out_in_australia_a/) That guy's post history is something else. To be fair, John McCain is right wing and would never do something like that. Let's not create ourselves unnecessary enemies. ""Its a terrible reminder of why we must remain vigilant, and why the president is taking steps to be proactive, rather than reactive, said White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Monday. https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/01/30/the-white-house-just-cited-the-quebec-mosque-attack-to-justify-trumps-policies.html  Meanwhile the shooter was most likely a Canadian born right wing extremist. I did not see any policies of Trump that were proactive regarding stopping these people from doing such things. So what do you think Spicer was referring to? Nothing.  It is just a building, dude, it can't talk.  They cited this attack to support Trump's muslim ban Did you see Spicer's address? He almost, *almost* calls it a terrorist attack. Listen closely at 30 seconds:   https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/01/30/the-white-house-just-cited-the-quebec-mosque-attack-to-justify-trumps-policies.html I am pretty sure they are. Those people might be ignorant or seemingly ignorant about many issues, but when it comes to furthering their self-interest they are experts. That is how they got there in the first place. And Trump himself made extensive statements about how easy it is to play the media with vague statements, etc etc.  They'll say it again and again and again, and enough people who don't read follow up stories will slowly let it absorb into their collective conscious that, oh yeah, there was another muslim attack right around the time of the ban I think, so maybe it's justified after all.   It's like the size of the inauguration argument. It's easy to disprove - you just need to look at two photos. But so many from Trump's side will just keep saying it that in a few years from now a majority of people who want it to be true will have a sort of vague recollection of there being some sort of controversy (by the FAKE NEWS liberal media no doubt) and yeah, of course the inauguration was the biggest one yet.  > Why the fuck is this a competition for any rational person?  Rational people don't make this a competition. Irrationals do.  This.  There were people just waiting to jizz in their pants for the killer to be muslim, and for the killer to be white.   The same thing happened during the shooting of that Orlando nightclub, where people were waiting to jizz in their pants for the killer to be white and others for the killer to be muslim, where the killer was actually a muslim terrorist.  So many people only look at these actions as ammunition to bash their opposites over the head with as opposed to, you know, the suffering of innocent people. I honestly believe most people believe this, but that the vocal minority drowns out the people who want to civilly discuss things, so we just give up because it's exhausting trying to talk to ignorant assholes. This goes for all sides. For us to make any progress in this world we each need to step up and tell the idiots of our groups to shut up and sit down while the adults talk...and stop trying to ""discuss"" things via personal attacks and schoolyard taunts. Until then, the lunatics will continue to run the asylum. Either that, or they'll claim it was a conspiracy of some kind.  Either a false flag, or a coverup.  I've heard some people on FB say that the real shooter was the Muslim guy they arrested but then released as a witness, and they're just trying to cover it all up by arresting this other guy. http://imgur.com/a/F0k55  Fox edited the story after spreading lies lol They deleted all the posts when the shooter was confirmed. Must have been dozens when it first happened.   They were joking how Muslims were doing their work for them.  Don't worry. Putin will release the new script soon.  Yeah they their tails tucked between their legs at the moment. The picture of the dude... might as well be the poster boy for the red pill and t_d... it's exactly what I imagine when I slum in those subs.  No Canadians on US Soil! > tinfoil hats ahoy  Awesome OMFG what is wrong with these people? To them, every crime committed by a white male is one of the two. Just look at the conspiracies that surrounds mass shooters. Sandy Hook? Clearly a conspiracy, the kid was under hypnosis. Aurora? Mind control false flag conspiracy. San Bernardino? Muslims being Muslims. Paris shooting? Muslims being Muslims.  If they don't come up with these bullshit reasons then they won't have any justifiable reason to hate on these groups of people.   I mean, they can't openly admit to being racist. No no, they have to make it look like they're the good guys otherwise they can't play the victim. Sounds sort of like a /pol/tard though. Probably can look for it on /r/metacanada and look for a poster who hasn't commented in the last 24 hours.  /r/The_Donald is one of the most heavily censored forums on reddit. That's why I fear for freedom of speech under Trump, because his supporters are supportive on only the one kind of speech, their speech. Democracy ends when you don't allow alternative voices, even if you don't like them. We call this: Fascism.  Welcome to the New Reich. They're waiting for someone to explain how this is some kind of false-flag set up like the pizzagate gunman, I'm sure.  Don't worry, they'll find some insane conspiracy theory and call it a ""false flag operation"" soon enough. I guarantee it. You say that as a joke, but there are still people obsessed with pizzagate. I recently helped create a subreddit that exposes r/metacanada for the bigotry and racism that it has been spreading to other Canada-related subreddits. A vocal minority of them has been spilling into r/canada and r/canadapolitics with the quality of discussion getting noticeably worse since the 2016 US election.  The link to the subreddit is here: r/OnGuardForThee (named after the second verse of the O Canada)  I encourage fellow Canadians who are against hateful rhetoric to use this subreddit to document and expose the bigots in Canada-related subreddits for their true colours. We need to build a northern ice wall.. and make Mexico pay for it. I actually saw somebody seriously say that on twitter a few minutes ago. They're so pathetic. putin: trump is the key to all this, cause trump a better puppet then we've ever had before That's part of the problem.  They speak like they're experts on a whole bunch of countries that they've never set foot in. Now this is a serious question for /r/worldnews.  What causes a man to go neutral? Lust for money, power? Or is he just born with a heart full of neutrality? This is the only place where sanity lies. Listen to this person.   The fact that so many people buy into this I'm a conservative/liberal and it's us vs. them shit is sad, try critical thought and a nuanced view based on facts and information. I share views with conservatives and liberals alike because I don't subscribe to a political doctrine outlined for me by a politician, on what I should think about every economic and social issue.  These 'liberal hippy snowflake pussies' who cry racist every minute of the day are just regular human beings, who like the Muslim haters, have decided to let someone else do their thinking for them. Dylan Storm Roof and that Dark Knight Rises killer showed it's much easier to stay alive after killing many people when you're... well, white. I should not have clicked on that... [Cool, I hadn't heard of that, but it perfectly defines a feeling I've had for a long time. Thank you.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe's_law) Trolling used to be a lot more acceptable back when there wasn't so much overlap between social media and entertainment. Nobody was playing video games or surfing old meme sites to have political discussions. Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and similar platforms brought the two together and now we see what ""trolling"" looks like when applied to more serious discussions like world politics and terrorism.  More importantly, we see what happens when audiences grow from a few hundred to a few hundred thousand members. The number of confrontational human beings in the audiences we have on Reddit is far more than any individual can manage to dig through. Being targeted by their efforts just once ruins a person's mood for days, so even though there's not many of them compared with the total population of the internet, they have a really horrible effect on the whole.  *spelling [removed] But this guy didn't stick in an echo chamber. He's well known because he was picking arguments with people who disagreed with him. Being convinced you are smart and all the sheeple are dumb is also a major problem many have which allows beliefs to reach irrational extremes.  I read about the same when it comes to dangers of online pedophile communities, even those without CP. It's called the neutralization effect. They lose sight of whats right or wrong and they all validate each other.  So much of our approach to each other and understanding of ourselves could be improved if we put more emphasis on our social nature and how it determines our behavior. It's a good thing we're not in one of those now! I don't think they're mutually exclusive. I'd be hard pressed to call a mass murderer not terrorising.. Unless you're into that sort of shit What wonderous times we live in where we must debate whether mass murderers are worse than terrorists Don't be silly; we all know that people are only terrorists when they have a moderate levels of melanin in their skin. /s  Seriously, I have no idea why people are so dead set against calling acts of terrorism for what they are if it's not someone from out of the country. He sounds like a 4chan /pol/uck. > Any community that gets its laughs by pretending to be idiots will eventually be flooded by actual idiots who mistakenly believe that they're in good company.  -[DarkShikari](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1011498) For those wondering 4chan used to be full of people pretending to be idiots but had now been flooded by actual idiots. The first google result is for a wikiquote link. I got fooled for a few minutes. Except...  A lot of those ""idiots"" were originally in on the joke.  That is how cults work.  That is how people become radicalized.  You start out participating for the fun, for other people who do it with you.  It's a group activity, where you're ""in on it"".  It's something that makes you special, different from all the other people you see.    And then, after a while, something clicks.  You forget that you ever pretended.  You start believing the stupid things you type, because you associate with them, you in fact associate your entire identity with them.  You get angry when people try to remind you that it's bullshit...  Once you're radicalized, it's very difficult to come back. It's like the dude who told Shia LaBouf 'Hitler did nothing wrong.' Dude being a colossal asshole, thinking he was being this funny edgelord? Probably. But you can't fucking tell the different, and people have been murdered over that belief. It's not fucking funny. I know a guy who genuinely believes that stuff, and it totally pisses me off that people like him are actually kinda getting their way now, and that more people can't see how insane they are.  It makes it seem less serious. ""Oh this person with shitty opinions is someone I associate with politically is just being a troll, we don't really think these things"", ""Oh that woman who verbally abused those people for their race was just totally trolling, you're overreacting"", ect. Ect. Its just an excuse to silence other people from saying ""Hey that's really not okay."" ""Shut up, you gonna cry? It was just trolling bro"" I don't know, to purposely agitate people online and spread bad ideas seems like a genuinely offensive position in itself.   I don't think there are trolls who are really good people. Buckle up, buckaroos. 'Member when terrorists were brown?  they also react really poorly to actual humor Just treat them all like genuine believers. It's the only way to be sure. yeah, no one on the left is expressing joy that it happened. That's a major difference. Speaking of bridging differences and being tolerant, can we just fucking stop with these generalizations?  There's no ""the right"" and ""the left"", there's just a whole bunch of people of varying opinions and life experiences and *the overwhelming majority of them are decent people*. Why judge the whole group based on its absolutely worst elements? I'm pretty sure intent is part of the definition. There are a lot of terrorists we've refused to call terrorist. I'm glad we're starting.  [removed] Every time a white man shoots up a ~~theater~~ church, it's a mass shooting. When it's a brown man shooting up a nightclub, it's a terrorist attack. Ask the media why it has to do with ethnicity. It shouldn't, but it does.  This is the first time people have been calling out the attack for what it is.  And probably only because Trudeau called it that.  edit: changed example to be a better example, charleston shooting was politically motivated (he wanted to ""start a race war"") but never called a terror attack.  Yeah we got a lot of shootings. Was it middle east terrorism, anti-Muslim terrorism, anti-gay terrorism, school shooting, ""other"" mass shooting, or just your garden variety gang violence. And if they kill people from an abortion clinic. Shouldn't that be also terrorism? When that happens News outlets wait, if it's Muslim is terrorism. If it is a right-wing guy then he was just crazy.  It should be as you say. But it is not how news are written. Also, a ""terrorist attack"" often comes with the implication of a continuing threat due to the political nature of the attack. I wish you were correct, but the present term no longer stipulates one's actual beliefs.  A troll only needs to be incendiary now.  Look around you -- there is no longer a clear gap between a person pretending to be horrific, and a person actually being horrific.  Words change, I'm sorry. 4chan is anonymous so perhaps stop believing anything from there Day of the rake shall come one day, anon. after spending a couple days reading that sub, it's scary how true this is. I was banned for light disagreements Or maybe an r/incel. That would explain some of the boiling rage.  I'm glad your parents showed kindness to your gay dinner guests.  But the truth is that 1 in 4 Americans self report that [they believe homosexuality  should be a crime.](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1651/gay-lesbian-rights.aspx)  So there's that. The only problem I have with this is the Republican party for a long time has shared political and moral ideals with those who we all would call racists. The party has been unwilling to publicly demonize these ppl and in the past election actively used them to garner support for a republican congress and republican president. I'm more of a moderate myself (wasn't the biggest fan of Obama, and while I disagree with them on matters like abortion and health care I respect Republicans like John McCain) but I place more blame on sane Republicans for letting their party be hijacked by bigots, homophobes, and nazis.    Edit: a word  > My parents are Republicans and couldn't be more thrilled when my sister's flamingly gay Pakistani hairdresser & friend comes over for drinks...which one of our anecdotes is right?  It's the degree of separation.  Those that you live near are okay, but those that you only hear about are scum.  It's what causes the entire ""All of them are awful, but you're the exception"" kind of thing.  My grandmother hates gay people, but I have a gay friend who visits us sometimes and she treats him very well and almost never has a mean word to say about him. But this goes to the individual action vs. separated by several degrees action.    There were white people in the South who treated their slaves well and thought of them as members of the family, paid them an allowance, and would never consider using barbaric methods like whips for discipline.    But these people still supported the confederacy and sent money to the Confederacy which defended slavery and all of its excesses.    Your parents may like your sister's flamingly gay Pakistani hairdresser, but (by your stated report of their party affiliation) they voted for a guy who is making sure that if this Pakistani guy will not be able to see any member of his family.    (This is for sake of argument, I am not trying to besmirch your parents as hypocrites, just saying that people can be ok with the members of a group on an individual level but still enable injustice done to members of a group.)  Come to the Northwest! We have the BEST closeted racists!! Its gonna be HUGE Glad you do. Every time I sort a thread about immigration to new and read about how ""I hope all the Muslims kill each other so we can finish them off"" or ""Armenians are beasts who deserve to be put down"" (I didn't even know a lot of people hated Armenians?) It makes me lose mine. Yea, I apologize for making it sound like I'm suggesting that all republicans would react in such a way because that's simply not true.  It's easy to label them as mental, it's harder to recognise that a lot of them are normal people who have found themselves in a position where they have no hope, nothing going for them and nothing to lose. It could be you in the future and you'd never guess it. I was trail riding a few years ago on a jeep truck trail. The guys in the jeeps tried to run me and my friend over repeatedly, one of the guys screaming ""we're gonna kill ya!""  Where we were at, the could have done it and gotten away with it.  There are people out there, if given the proper opportunity, would kill someone if they weren't going to receive consequences for it.  That's what makes those shitty purge movies frightening. They honestly arent that far off from what would do. Though I think it would be far less people than the movies show.  These are the people antifa want to punch but liberals keep defending ""alt-right"" is just a marketing term invented by neo-nazis. Nothing ""alternative"" about this, it's the same shit ideology Mussolini and Hitler pushed 100 years ago. It's definitely not satire, those people are just terrible human beings. This is why we punish individuals, not groups. Collective punishment as a tactic knows no political ideology: Hitler used it as did Stalin.   So if you are right-leaning and feel uncomfortable with this news, know that you have company among those Muslims whose entry was refused.  There's something to be said about all the premature celebration on social media about how this ""BTFO liberal narrative"" or whatever.  That the Kansas Crusaders planned a terrorist attack on Muslims to ""wake people up"" to the ""fact"" that Muslims are terrorists, just makes me agree even harder with you. I want to upvote you a million times. It's their little safe space after all. [""I reject your reality, and substitute my own!""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8qcccZy03s) And there's no news outlets reliable enough anymore to trust 100%, so anything that doesn't perfectly into anyones agenda can be dismissed as fake news really easily.  I heard someone call the NYT a ""liberal gossip rag"" the other day.  THE NEW YORK TIMES.  If people aren't trusting the NYT, then, who do you trust?  And why does everyone seem to think they alone are getting the right news and it's everyone else who is stupid enough to believe the fake news. On that sub, how can you tell the difference? Sadly not, because if that were the case Trump would have never been elected. As much as we hate to believe it, THERE ARE A FUCKING TON OF SHITTY RACIST AMERICANS. They're extremists. Their ideology is more similar to those of Islamic terrorists than sane rational humans.  I don't recall seeing it in r/worldnews.  Though admittedly, I was spending most of my time on local news pages that day... Wow You should have put a warning up before I clicked that link.  It's my first foray into /r/the_donald.  I think I may now be infected.   Is it contagious? Does anybody know? He did say Right Wing *idiots*, and McCain is an elder statesman and war hero, and I don't think he's in that group. They pretty much used it as an excuse for the Muslim ban. Then we find out that it was a white guy that loved Donald. I wonder what alternative facts they are going to bring up in this case. Sean Spicer cannot get a break, so many alt facts and so little time. Sean Spicer looks like an overcompensating little human who has a bad temper.  I picture him screaming at women and children for some reason.  His suit jackets usually also look way bigger than he is; kinda like his boss' red ties.  Always overcompensating.  Does anyone else see this stuff by any chance? So then they gotta ban all the Atheist White people too!?  To be fair this can be taken both ways. Anyone else notice how quick he went from Terrorist to Shooter?  One specific fact seems to have initiated that media change...Maybe I'm wrong though It was a terrorist attack though, just from a white supremacist.   Irrationals on both sides of the board too Woah woah woah are you saying you are non-partisan on this subject? you must be literally Hitler Yep, the guy was paid by Hillary to do it!   -Trumpettes probably They were out in force before his identity came out, shaming everyone for being eager to find out whether this guy confirmed their beliefs.  This is the first time I've seen the phrase red pill outside of the Matrix. Should I change my email that involves those words? Well, at least they aren't celebrating it. You're right, that is an interesting pattern of denial. I never saw that so clearly before. not mutually exclusive There's a theory that r/the_donald is a 4chan raid gone long-term. Then I hope they give us his reddit usernames. ""If we don't believe in freedom of expression for people we despise, we don't believe in it at all."" - Noam Chomsky The Alt-Reich they are trying. But they are a bit afraid it seems. The official position is reality (sounding more like ""if we don't do this right we're going to look bad"" self serving bullshit).  A lot of them don't want to be dragged to reality, and are trying the ""false flag"" approach and getting some negative feedback from their peers.  A lot more don't want to make it seem like they are ""virtue signaling"" or kissing the asses of ""libtards"".  So they are doing some soul searching, very little of it reflects the good side of humans though.  They have changed it, now its anytime any government official is associated with pedophilia they have secured a victory!  The whole pizza shit was just to get ""attention to the issue""  Goal posts have moved so fucking far. Man, what the hell happened to /r/metacanada? Like 4 or 5 years ago it used to be a circlejerk subreddit which made fun of some of the more hysterical posts on /r/canada (""Conservatives did a thing - IS THIS THE END OF CANADIAN DEMOCRACY?!"").  At some point it started taking itself way too seriously and now it's just alt-right Trump supporters. Are you kidding me, I'm an expert in Sweden thank you I studied at the best imageboards Yup. Can confirm- I come from a very conservative area and decided to spend several months in Jordan to learn the language and culture. It was incredible, absolutely eye opening... just a wonderful experience. Interesting how it was the people telling me that I was on a suicide mission or how I was turning into an ISIS wife (wtf) were also the ones who had no interest in hearing about what I saw and learned.  I'm guessing if it weren't for the military, 99% of right-wingers would never leave the USA. Check out the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon. Now you'll notice it happen with Poe's Law.  Edit: [link for the lazy.](https://www.damninteresting.com/the-baader-meinhof-phenomenon/) >Nobody was playing video games or surfing old meme sites to have political discussions.  You must be too young to remember MUDs and Usenet.  Ironically, the thing that annoys me about modern trolls is not what they say but what they don't say. There's no art to it anymore, it's all just childish invective, threats and name calling. There's no leading people up the garden path with ridiculous conceits passed off in such a way to be believable. I get annoyed on a meta level at how bad people are at trolling in this day and age. Those two things aren't really in conflict. ""Picking arguments with people who disagree with him"" likely didn't entail much more than him regurgitating, verbatim, whatever misleading dreck he had read in his echo chamber community. Morality is subjective in the western world, morality comes from religion in theocracy, morality comes from the state under communism/fascism but in the wild west of ideas and culture morality comes from whatever culture you choose to ascribe to.   Or if you're like data the self - a culture of one.   Terrorism implies a political angle and a degree of targeting. He killed people *because* they were innocent Muslims.   Al Capone was a mass murderer but not a terrorist...he killed people as part of his business model. Ted Bundy was a mass murderer but not a terrorist...he killed people to get his rocks off.  The KKK they ~~were~~ are terrorists. They are not mutually exclusive, but calling him a mass muderer and not a terrorist is making disappeared the political ideology behind it. The choice, particulary by the media and politicians, is not insignificant.   Edit: added politicians and corrected insignificant (I am a french-canadian, sorry) Terrorism is the use of violence against a civilian population for political purposes. A mass shooting with no ideology behind it is just mass murder. A mass shooting propelled by, in this case, Alt-Reich ideology is terrorism.  How much says this is  the story behind Scientology? My brother is unfortunately one of these people.  Let's just say his critical thinking skills are...lacking. I think this is how internet natives feel but that is not how people and media are using the word anymore.   While it used to mean ""people that don't believe the things they are saying and are just getting a reaction"", now it's turned into ""they are dumb as trolls and nothing you will say will change their stupid troll like mind. And they enjoy stomping around and wreaking havoc because they are stupid dumb trolls."", you know like the mythical creature troll.  This makes everything very confusing while these definitions have very different types of people behind them, on paper (or more likely: screen) the same thing could be described with either one and there is no way to know which one is true.   fucking normies get out of my jihad Conservatives do that.  I wouldn't say ""no one"" That is a lot of people to account for and I am sure that any group as broad as the liberals has plenty of assholes floating around. But otherwise I totally agree. Not only that, but this forced separation of ""them and us"" probably played a part that led to the tragic event we are commenting on right now. It is, but ethnicity isn't That's some next level shit.  Whats the deal with questions? I'm fucking angry too but I lack bloody direction! To be fair, terrorists are politically motivated.  It's not like the Colorado shooter was a terrorist. He was just a mass murderer. It's not like one is a higher tier than the other, it's about motivations. Doesn't  the argument upon whether it is terrorism or not stem from the motivations of the shooter? Also shootings because a person got fired from a job or relationship issues. Sadly, that is much too true. Some coworkers and I've almost started to bet on who did it and why. I guess we just need to ""laugh"" to keep ourselves from crying. >  or just your garden variety gang violence.  Man, don't joke about that.  You know gang violence doesn't get reported lol > And if they kill people from an abortion clinic. Shouldn't that be also terrorism?  Yes. In Canada at least it's considered terrorism. That's an ineresting point, given how abortion is such a politically potent vehicle to gain or sway voting. /pol/ has poster Ids.  His flag, poster id, and filenames all matched the original OP. You dont have your Facebook linked to your 4chan account?!   Perhaps learn wtf you're saying before shitposting. They have user ids so you know without doubt if its the same person in each thread while remaining anonymous.  > 4chan is anonymous  nah I kinda like this statistic.  It puts into perspective these polls done to muslims about sharia law. Holy shit that's depressing.  There's also the fact that that particular statistic is steadily tending downward. Let's keep it going that way; it's not going to shoot to 0 overnight.   What is heartening is that it's not so much people changing their minds, it's younger people being raised with better views and judgements. It takes a while, but that's how change is made. If it was the opposite case, we wouldn't be making any progress at all. So 3 in 4 don't? I am slightly impressed. Yah, people with mental illness are far more likely to be victimized by violent crime than to commit terrible crimes. It's a seriously damaging misconception that this type of crime is committed by people with mental illness.   Perfectly normal people snap all of the time. You are far more likely to be killed by a regular dude with a grudge than a person who is mentally ill. Mentally ill people are far greater dangers to themselves than to others.

Take my meds, do my work on ed products, got no record and they still talk about putting me on lists and shitand taking away my rights.   Put yourselves on a list! Haha. >That the Kansas Crusaders planned a terrorist attack on Muslims to ""wake people up"" to the ""fact"" that Muslims are terrorists  But now we are dealing with the old hypocrisy of the Western World.  Group that kills in our interest we call ""*freedom fighters*"" and the group that kills against our interest we call ""*terrorists*"".  This, all of this, with Donald just acting as the most obvious tumor of the cancer, is a product of decades upon decades of word-twisting.  We simply reached its most obvious apex, where it is impossible not to notice as long as you can add 2 + 2.  People lately been bringing up 1984 by Orwell a lot, but honestly I would really really advise for people to look into Neil Postman's book ""*Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business*"".  It is a far more disturbing book, and if 1984 is a made up world based on symbolism, than Postman's is a critic on the real world. You joke but [they seriously want their own safe space](http://www.breitbart.com/milo/2016/07/05/solution-online-harassment-simple-women-log-off/) because they're offended by different viewpoints.   >The internet cant cope any more with such strenuous tension between the sexes. I mean, theres a reason that male golfers dont compete against female golfers. Theyre in a league of their own, and it would end in tears. Its time to apply this logic to the online world.  >Heres my suggestion to fix the gender wars online: Women should just log off. Given that men built the internet, along with the rest of modern civilisation, I think its only fair that they get to keep it. And given what a miserable time women are having on the web, surely they would welcome an abrupt exit. They could go back to bridge tournaments, or wellness workshops, or swapping apple crumble recipes, or whatever it is women do in their spare time.  >I, Donald Trump and the rest of the alpha males will continue to dominate the internet without feminist whining. It will be fun! Like a big fraternity, with jokes and memes and no more worrying about whether an off-colour but harmless remark will suddenly torpedo your career.  >Well get to keep 4chan, any news sites that actually matter, like this one, and the few reddit communities that havent yet contracted cancer. Its a win-win!  So, in ridiculing others for being offended too easily, these people get offended and demand that they be given their own safe space.   THIS! I remember the first time I came across r/The_Donald I actually thought it was just a troll subreddit.   On *the internet*, how can you tell the difference?  You've probably heard of [Poe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe's_law), but anyone who hasn't should take it to heart. But his VP selection surely was.  He's an enabler. We shouldn't forget the bad he's done just because right now we have even worse. They're going to completely ignore the truth, just like all the people on reddit who were frothing at the mouth when they thought it was a muslim.  It's mind boggling. They're using the persecution and murder of Muslims in Canada by white nationalists as an excuse to further persecute and endanger the lives of more Muslims. ""we need to ban muslims before the fuckheads that elected me kill them."" > They pretty much used it as an excuse for the Muslim ban.    Think about it! If you ban all the Muslims then none of them will be there to die when the Mosque gets shot up! He's saving lives! 4D Chess! The prime minister stated it was a terrorist attack.  Prime minister called it an act of terrorism against all Canadians. brown people are terrorists... roof isn't a terrorist. this guy isn't. alternative facts! The point being that the administration doesn't want to call it a terrorist attack. He almost let it slip out. Bingo.  Everyone needs to remember this.  Take a look at /r/TheRedPill if you're curious what people mean when they use it in that context.    Edit: to be clear I am not at all endorsing the views on that sub. Pretty sure the Venn diagram of the two is almost a circle  Odds are they frequent both. They came to troll, but stayed for the meta. I don't think it's a theory, it's pretty well known that /pol/ was instrumental in the early stages of /the_donald especially. What's up for debate is whether it started as a troll or not It's not a theory that's exactly what happened.  They didn't give a shit until he retweeted the pepe meme then the whole circlejerk got started.  It rapidly went from a joke to an identity as more and more pathetic people who weren't smart enough to see it as a joke latched on. r/the_donald is basically iceland. A bunch of raiders got lost and ended up sticking around. That was originally Rosa Luxembourg, Chomsky was quoting her.  The_donald are not full on nazis.  /r/altright are literal nazis  [4th highest post on /r/altright, a picture of their ""Boys in Grey""](http://i.imgur.com/LOkdZUG.jpg)  [5th Highest post: Who thinks interracial marriage is bad?](https://www.reddit.com/r/altright/comments/5p0qzi/number_of_people_who_think_miscegenation_is_wrong/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=browse&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=altright)  edit: Don't feed the troll... Before Trump rose to prominence, I actually thought some of the posts on metacanada were funny. /r/Canada a few years back, around election time, was in hysteria over literally everything thing Harper did, and metacanada a was reverse circlejerk in response to the circlejerking going on in /r/Canada. You have to admit posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/metacanada/comments/3ps8l3/justin_trudeau_promises_lifelong_jays_wins/) are at least somewhat humorous.  But that place, along with every other major conservative subreddit, has just became another Trump propaganda mouthpiece.   Reddit has gone to complete shit ever since /pol/ migrated to the_donald. I used to go for dumb memes and news, it actually used to be enjoyable. Now I end up somewhat pissed off every time I use this fucking website, from the sheer amount of bigotry and ignorance coming from Trumpets on major subreddits. The current condition of this website resembles stage 4 terminal cancer; Trumpets have spread their cancer nearly every where. Honestly, at this point, I don't even know if a mass purge will cure it.  Seriously considering migrating to another website if admins don't fucking take action, and ban certain subreddits. The problem with echo chambers is you need to get more and more extreme just to be heard, until eventually everyone involved acts like a crazy person with no relation to reality. So... The same thing that happened to most Conservatives in the world... Same thing happened to the /r/India circlejerk sub /r/Bakchodi. BRAINWASHED by the enemy no doubt Didn't know what that was called either. Thank you. Check out this [list of cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) on Wikipedia, it's got the Dunning-Kreuger Effect which is my favorite. And now Baader-Meinhoff Baader-Meunhoffed itself, because about 15 minutes ago I explained Baader-Meinhoff to someone. At least on usenet the political discussion was often restricted to groups for that purpose, in my experience. Oh there are plenty of really good trolls. The problem is there are also a LOT of super-gullible (or dishonest) people who don't figure out it's a joke even after you've told them straight to their face.  Things get kinda whacky when everyone takes your obvious satire as gospel, and the next thing you know half the country thinks a cartoon frog is secret code for internet nazis.  Are you saying that any of the other sources of morality are less subjective? You've just moved the entity choosing the morality up one level. A society (or culture) deciding which values it holds important can be argued to be just as arbitrary.  From what I'm seeing, there isn't anyone with access to some objective morality. And the hegemony of cultures (which made them appear universal or even objective) has been challenged and has faded and what you're describing is essentially a reaction to that power vacuum. > Ted Bundy was a mass murderer  Wouldn't Ted be more of a serial killer and less mass murderer?  I thought mass murder was like killing a bunch of people at once or over a relatively short time frame.  You can be a terrorist without killing anybody. You can be a mass murdered with a political aim.   This guy appears to be both.  You can also be a mass murder with political ideology behind it, but not be technically considered a terrorist, like when states do it or during war time. My Lai isn't usually referred to as an act of terrorism, for instance.  what? terrorism was huge in the 1970s with a bunch of political groups operating in first world countries. They were definitely familiar with terrorism. The term did get loosey-goosey after 9/11 though. I think it's an issue with lone wolf attacks being counted as stemming from a central organizing committee.   That's right. ""Terrorism"" wasn't en vogue as a marketing term for politics and mass media back then.  The only argument they have is IQ, have him take a test. I'm assuming you already know this, but for those who may not be familiar with the etymology of the term ""trolling"", it refers to trolling as in fishing by dragging a lure behind you and waiting for fish to bite. It referred to people who would goad a reaction out of others by making incendiary comments (the bait) which would then draw other commenters (the fish) into an argument.  See also: now a ""meme"" is just any image with white text on it. Something that many people forget, or callously disregard. Dude, you forgot to argue It's also why the people who kidnapped the white kid in Chicago committed a hate crime because he was white. The motivations are everything. > To be fair, terrorists are politically motivated.  It would be pretty tough to argue that a rabid xenophobic, alt-right, anti-feminist Trump supporter killing a bunch of Muslims in their place of prayer *two days* after Trump's Muslim Ban is somehow *not* politically motivated. Dylan Roof sure as shit was a terrorist though Attacking minorities because you want them cleared out so you can live in a homogenous white ethnostate is a pretty fucking political motive. So is attacking Muslims because you don't like your government taking in refugees. Lots of things that are classified as hate crimes actually fit the bill as acts of terrorism too, but a white perpetrator rarely gets labelled as one. You mean like terrorizing Muslims... mhhh? Terrorize gays or terrorize (insert religious group here).  There really is no distinction here at least in my mind.  They're actively trying to scare people and/or spark a violent uprising against a group of people.  Terrorism is terrorism is terrorism. You're right, theater shooting was a bad example. Charleston shooting is more apt, the media NEVER called it a terrorist attack despite fitting the definition pretty well! Oh shit really? Can i bug you for a link? I havent heard anything about this and i live on the Island. oh man, if you want to open that can of worms lets throw gang hits into this. ahem, looking at you chicago...the sad part is we don't even hear about 98% of because it's gotten so common place. well, I shouldn't say ""gotten"". It's not really a recent development. Some coworkers from a few jobs ago would play the news game. We'd bet on what the lead story/first fully talked about would be on the nightly national news. It started with ""Did the cops shoot a black guy today? Yes/No"" And then after that week of horrific violence ended we made up categories such as Police Brutality, Weather, Mass Shooting, International, Terrorism, and I think one or two more. If someone chose the same category as you, you had to choose a subsection, once the bf and I both guess weather, I went with winds, he went with fire, and in the fire story they caught a fire tornado on video. That was a tie. It ended when we tried to go 5 for 5 in the categories and one guy guessed the first 5 stories in order correctly.  People just need to find the good in bad things, a little morbid fun is fine as long as we still respect what's happening.  I'm still super stoked about Fire Tornado, though. That was awesome. The same thing happens in the news industry, police, and medical fields. When you're so used to something you get desensitized. Honestly when I heard about the attack in Canada and how many people died, I thought ""that's it?""  It has to be in the double digits to stick out here in America. Yeah, OP said the guy came back to that same thread to post. Even anonynous users on 4chan can be identified by the poster ID assigned to their post on that thread. But do they have superegos, that's the question... And Americans have the benefit of a stable democracy and education system. Imagine how easy it would be to be a Muslim extremist if you've seen drone strikes affect people you know and the cleric said that they are trying to destroy Islam. It would harden your belief in the extremes of the religion. And you could easily (though not very precisely without the raw data) break it down further.  The rates amongst republicans and evangelicals(and many other groups) are almost certainly higher.  This just hit me like a punch in the gut.  Hopefully this is just another case of ""not actually worse, just hearing more about it,"" but it's hard to tell these days. Oh absolutely it does. People like to refer to these kinds of statistics  to evidence a narrative of  ""Islam is not fit for modern civilization""  as if these moral opinions are formed based on the dogma of religion alone and not a tangled web of overlapping social influences and cultural history, of which religion is only a single (albeit significant) aspect.   It's a bit counter-intuitive, because common narratives of the history of ""Western Civilization"" frequently link the changing role of the Church/Christianity in society to wider socioeconomic changes, yet when it comes to Islam in the modern world, we're supposed to swallow our doubt and the swing the other way to hold ideology as stronger than material factors in cultural evolution. In 2017 There are still more Americans who oppose interracial marriage(1 in 8) than the total African American population.  (And there are almost no black people who oppose it) Every day this year I wake up and check the news and feel a wave of pure disgust and disappointment in humanity. When I was a naive kid the future looked so bright. The social barbarism of the past was no more, and the human race seemed destined to explore space. I thought the people in charge were wise adults who knew just what to do. Now I see us for the fearful, vicious, cruel, paranoid animals we are. Fear and hate reign, and war and disaster seem to be around every corner. I just want something to take comfort in. Yesterday I took comfort in that ""at least this shit wouldn't happen in Canada"". This is gonna be a rough few years at least.  I remember having a safe space rule for an LGBT student organization at college. The rule went as such:  ""What happens in this room stays in this room. Unless the person speaking gives you direct permission to share what they said, you are not to spread this anywhere outside of these meetings.  ""This means that, if someone decides to come out officially to their fellow members, but is still uncomfortable with letting the random public know, don't tell other people outside of this session.""  It said nothing about removing differing opinions. And a 'safe space' should be just that. Feel free to share (legal) things that you wouldn't normally, without fearing that it will be spread around behind your back. It doesn't mean that you can remove anyone who disagrees. I love how they think of themselves as an ""alpha male"". Yeah, dude, you're totally in a position where men envy you and women want you, and totally not just a nobody on the internet.  I'm glad I'm not the only. When I found TD by accident I was laughing cause I thought it was an actual troll subreddit. I was wrong. :( it originally was a troll sub and it evolved over time Holy shit I'm never going back to that delusional world again I'm just convinced it's trolls trolling trolls. Which kind of makes it look more serious than a regular trolling. Just wait until some Muslim randomly shoots someone next week.   r/the_donald might implode. These guys spent decades dehumanizing Muslims, they probably secretly celebrated this. Let's look at what Trumps puppetmaster Steve Banon believes in.  [Banon an apocalyptic Christian Warrior.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCVvc2hNVMU) He is part of a Christian Dominionist organization called the Council for National Policy (as is Kelly Anne Conway). He wants a holy war and the scariest thing is that they are a true doomsday cult; they believe in ""hastening the day of the Lord"" with the ""Church Militant"", and they don't care anything at all about this fragile beautiful blue marble we're on because the world is SUPPOSED to end in fire, God is SUPPOSED to burn it up and throw all the baddies (that is, people they disagree with) into a ""lake of eternal fire"", so they are looking toward ""a new heaven and a new earth"" where they will ""reign forever as kings and priests in the kingdom"" - they are the truest and most dangerous kind of fanatic. [And here is some more details in another Reddit comment about how they want to create a collapse of society in America when they're done to rebuild it as a white Christian theocracy..](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5qy2gu/questions_multiply_over_bannons_role_in_trump/dd39xdt/) Possible that in their warped worldview, the attackers were in fact Muslims (attacking a Mosque, you know...) and the Liberal Media and the treacherous liberal Police took this poor White supremacist as scapegoat... I'm already hearing Alex Jones shouting the usual conspiracy theory.  Anything is possible for this new administration. It's a dreamworld! ""If Muslims wouldn't come to the West, white nationalists wouldn't murder them. The ban is for their own protection."" This argument was used a lot in t_d today oddly enough. ""This terrorist attack is just another example of the fundamental incompatibility of Muslims and western culture and will keep happening unless we deport them"". ""Steve, what does this horse looking piece do again?"" He did, and props to him. I've seen certain right wing media in the US describe him as shooter though.  because Trudeau actually has a sense of decency and values.  Let's call it what it is: RADICAL CHRISTIAN TERRORISM Yikes. It's like they're Vulcan incels. They stayed because they're wielding significant influence in the actual world. In real time. [removed] Except a lot of people really do believe that /pol/ garbage. Except Iceland is a nice place to be. Rosa more than anyone would support beating up fash, respectively, she'd wait until they were done talking. It's such a surreal experience going into that sub. How can these people experience the same events I do and take away and develop such hateful ideas? I look at one post after another and the events are the same but the comments are just so different from anything I would ever have thought. What has happened to these people that have caused them to be so hateful? Whats interesting is comparing articles or photos shared to both. I occasionally look at both /r/The_Donald and /r/altright, mainly because as a politically active Jew I'm cautious about any possible witch hunts from the far right (and my twitter was once shared around /r/altright, leading to a wave of anti-Semitic threats).   On three occasions I've seen the same pic/article with barely changed headlines on both subs. Just a couple days ago I found a thread in /r/The_Donald with upvoted comments pushing anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.   The alt right heavily recruits from alt light forums like TD because they often use the same ""news"" sources like Breitbart, Zero Hedge, Infowars, etc. TD is dangerous enough, but it's a major recruiting ground for the straight up neo-Nazis.  Wow thanks for that link, I really liked [this picture.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Cognitive_Bias_Codex_-_180%2B_biases%2C_designed_by_John_Manoogian_III_%28jm3%29.jpg) IIRC, that's what criminologists call a spree killer. That's thrue, but it's also for political reason, especially when the state who did the mass murder with a political ideology in mind actually won the war or hold a powerful place in the global stage.   Also, I am not sure if you can say that it's terrorism when it's the head of state who command or incited (Edit for Fuckeythedrunkclown) those actions. I know they can be charged with crime against humanity, though.  Side note: my students (high school) share what they call ""memes"", they're short funny video clips, like epic fails or people hurting themselves etc. I've tried to explain what an internet meme actually is (""back in my day!"") but they just think I'm uncool because I don't have a secondary Instagram account solely for posting 'memes"" no, YOU forgot to argue This is a good point.  Hate crime law is a good example.  Isn't that why this guy is being called a terrorist? I mean, yeah. This guy who attacked the mosque was likely trying to make Muslims fear for their lives. The South Carolina guy was definitely a terrorist.   But James Holmes, the Dark Knight shooter, he was just pretty imbalanced in the head.  Since Vito Rizutto got shot. The heads of the Calabrese clan were eliminated one after the other, the Hells Angels filled the vaccum and regained control over the city. Now the Mafia pays the Hells to keep the right to operate in the province. It has always been the other way around. no they don't. 4chan is 4 the Id exclusively. facebook is for superegos. That's exactly what this is. When the US and Pak armed rebels in Afghanistan to combat the Soviets, they were taught that they were performing ""Jihad"", fighting in the path of Allah. The Soviets went away, but the radicalized mindset never did, and now it always lurks, ready to burrow its way into the minds of people hurt by those who they once considered benefactors.   (Btw I guess I'll take the opportunity to throw some extra information in there: Jihad is derived from the Arabic ""Juhud"" which means ""effort"", and stands for any effort made to further Islam. There are a lot of categories of Jihad, and Jihad-bis-Saif (Jihad of the Sword) is only one, and is a national endeavor, not a personal one. The greatest Jihad is considered to be Jihad-bin-Nafs (Jihad of the self) which means fighting to gain mastery over your personal wants and desires. Other than that there's Jihad of the Book, Jihad of the Coin, and so on. It isn't just ""shout Allah-u-Akbar and blow yourself up for 72 virgins or something"" in fact, that is nowhere close to it. Just wanted to put that out there) Dude stop! You're killing my heart. People fucking suck.  I would love to have a source on this. Not sarcasm, would help me out a lot.  > Every day this year I wake up and check the news and feel a wave of pure disgust and disappointment in humanity. When I was a naive kid the future looked so bright.   That's because negative news gets you fired up and gets the news outlets more views. Don't buy into it. [The world is more safe and less violent than it has ever been.](http://www.npr.org/2016/07/16/486311030/despite-the-headlines-steven-pinker-says-the-world-is-becoming-less-violent) You mean cum. They might cum. Reading this upsets me because it's so gonna happen. >I'm already hearing Alex Jones shouting the usual conspiracy theory.  Is it going to involve elves again? Because I swear I'll tune in if it does.  Oh god Alex Jones. ""This just in, Arab Muslim terrorist strikes place of worship in canada"" 12 hours later... ""This just in, false flag in Canada, liberal media in cahoots with isis, illuminati and bigfoot.  How do you know what incels is if you don't know what red pills is? Pretty much this. Just like pc master race, a few kids who wanted to fit in went over the joke. At least they ended up becoming  a decent sub.  It still gets to me that they list The International Jew as required reading. I feel like a crazy person whenever I point this out to people because it isn't common knowledge that Henry Ford was a dedicated antisemite who also published an edition of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion back in the day. Explaining to my family the influences of these communities and of people like Steve Bannon often feels like such a lost cause simply because they dont know american racial history very well at all. I come across like a conspiracy theorist for telling them about stuff I learned about in high school. It's especially disheartening when I think about how their ignorant skepticism is the very thing that the altright exploit. Spree is atleast two people, at at least two locations.   Mass is atleast four people at once.   Serial is three or more on seperate occasions. I think I hear somewhere a killing spree is if the murders are committed in a tight timeline and a serial killer could take long periods of time off in between killings. Mass Murders kill a certain number of people in one event Strictly speaking, those are memes though. Anything that's viral is a meme. Memes have existed much longer than the internet, and essentially are just units of cultural knowledge that become popular. Here:   >A meme (/mim/ meem)[1] is ""an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture"".[2] A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures.[3]  >Proponents theorize that memes are a viral phenomenon that may evolve by natural selection in a manner analogous to that of biological evolution. Memes do this through the processes of variation, mutation, competition, and inheritance, each of which influences a meme's reproductive success. Memes spread through the behavior that they generate in their hosts. Memes that propagate less prolifically may become extinct, while others may survive, spread, and (for better or for worse) mutate. Memes that replicate most effectively enjoy more success, and some may replicate effectively even when they prove to be detrimental to the welfare of their hosts.[4]  >A field of study called memetics[5] arose in the 1990s to explore the concepts and transmission of memes in terms of an evolutionary model. Criticism from a variety of fronts has challenged the notion that academic study can examine memes empirically. However, developments in neuroimaging may make empirical study possible.[6] Some commentators in the social sciences question the idea that one can meaningfully categorize culture in terms of discrete units, and are especially critical of the biological nature of the theory's underpinnings.[7] Others have argued that this use of the term is the result of a misunderstanding of the original proposal.[8]  >The word meme originated with Richard Dawkins' 1976 book The Selfish Gene. Dawkins's own position is somewhat ambiguous: he welcomed N. K. Humphrey's suggestion that ""memes should be considered as living structures, not just metaphorically""[9] and proposed to regard memes as ""physically residing in the brain"".[10] Later, he argued that his original intentions, presumably before his approval of Humphrey's opinion, had been simpler.[11] At the New Directors' Showcase 2013 in Cannes, Dawkins' opinion on memetics was deliberately ambiguous.[12] No I didn't  Right, you and I consider him a terrorist. There are some out there that never will because he's not Muslim, and to them, that's a prerequisite. >But James Holmes, the Dark Knight shooter, he was just pretty imbalanced in the head.   That seems like an understatement.  I think you could say he's bat shit insane.  I can't tell if this is real life or the plot to the next season of Daredevil. http://www.gallup.com/poll/163697/approve-marriage-blacks-whites.aspx  13% of the country opposes Interracial marriage. Only 12.3% of America is black(96% of whom support interracial marriage). And that appears to terrify a certain sort of person.  Just a reminder that Trump appeared on Alex Jones' show in the past. 2 times IIRC. I miss the old days of conspiracies when it was all about annunaki and nephilim...  I've just never seen the latter mentioned. I'm certainly not the kind of person seeking out these kinds of subreddits. Your presentation in East remember facts, make me want to believe you are correct. So I'll accept your explanation. Tl;dr HE IS A BAD GUY That's not an argument, that's just contradiction! Oh I'm sorry, this is Abuse. You want 12A next door. It's not a contradiction, it's just the alternative fact.  No it isn't  
"
"23",22,"5r3pqt","2017-01-30","Stuff like this make me feel conflicted.   I know that thousands of North Koreans are suffering through no fault of their own, many starving to death and would benefit greatly from such a partnership.   However, will this really help the North Korean people, or will all the new food that they grow just be stolen by Kim and used to feed himself and the military he is using to maintain power?   It's a moral dilemma for sure.  This university is where the North Korean political and military elite are educated. The university is directly tied to the ruling class that are destroying the country.  Just remember to keep Reveille at home. 1.  buy some seeds 2.  plant the seeds 3.  water the seeds 4.  overthrow your dictator 5.  harvest food  Seems pretty simple. This makes me kinda sad. The genuine scum in ~~NJ~~ NK won't suffer as much because of this, but the other people will. It is pretty sad. Hey I just accepted admission into Texas A&M today! Texas A&M runs a campus in Qatar, so maybe North Korea has a shot? [removed] tilapia fish is very fast breeding, and potatoes grow almost any place on earth, good luck korea. conflicted......its not just a humanitarian crisis, its a political crisis as well. Since this University is where the elite go for school, then we can be sure the word wont get out that the USA helped in any way.  Then if you make them stronger .....yeh, conflicted.  Perhaps if there were Humanitarian 'boots on the ground"", visible, with food distribution in public....??? If only they had internet and could just look it up. It's always nice to see people helping others out! I'm proud to be a student at Texas A&M .    Can help me make this rock into tomato?  Food grows best in a free market economy with a democratic government component.  How do you grow food in the face of chronic shortages?  Step 1: Depose your shitty dictator. Step 2: Grow food. Why can't the u.s. be great at setting up schools and hospitals all over the fucking place like a rogue education health nation out to teach everything it knows?  The first thing people from other countries should think when they think about the u.s. is a schoolbook or doctor instead of a dollar sign or gun.  I wonder how the leaders of r/Pyongyang feel about this? I can't believe they actually asked for help... WOW! I thought they just kidnapped teachers when they needed them. Don't go Aggies it is a trap. They kidnap and hold you for hostage on your expertise level. No, let China help In my opinion, we set ultimatums for providing the knowledge. I know it SOUNDS bad, but if the North Korean people see that their flawless leader isn't God, and we are willing to support them, then we need transparency that the food will go to the entire populace and not just the military. Then, when Kim denies the proposal, the North Korean people will see that their leader prefers pride over their own lives. I mean, we have the technology to help, but that doesn't mean we should. America gets ridiculed for butting our noses into others affairs, but when we refuse to help in these situations we're considered the devil. Transparency is very little to ask for the lives of millions of people. America we're going to nuke the ever loving shit out of you. No seriously we're testing missiles and all that. You see all this plutonium? It's comin right at you America, we're going to drop it right on your west coast door step. You see these missiles now? They're getting better cause we're going to straight up nuke you bro and now we've got even more plutonium. Hope you're ready cause the fury's comin bitch!  ...............can you help us grow corn? We're in a little bit of a jam over here. lol a communist country experiencing shortages? shocking! It's not like there's a food shortage in North Korea, it's just that the lands have been so prosperous for generations that their agriculture hasn't had a chance to study chronic shortages, so they had to find somewhere that has had to deal with it. Texas A&M scientist: ""1st, you got to get potassium back in the soil, 2nd: plant these hardy crops, 3rd: kill your dictator, 4th: rotate your crops every harvest"" North Korea's principle bottleneck for peace is feeding their hungry.  It's essential that the United States offer an olive branch and give the DPRK the assistance it requires. There is much to be gained from a mutually beneficial extension of our most abundant and easy to share resource.  This is a classic example of ""teach one to fish"" instead of ""giving them a fish""  It shows a fair amount of humility and would help China see past certain misgivings in early movements by this administration.  The climate of the Texan state is generally similar to that of the rocky and somewhat arid terrain of the DPRK, so it's, again, a logical move by both Nations.     ""Roughly 20 minutes after you set up free elections supervised by the UN for an entire year with an occupational force to ensure the elections are free."" Welcome to Communist countries ! Where you forgot the basic technology of agriculture.  There exists a smuggled video that shows North Korean children, emaciated and filthy hovering around groups of outside diners. As occasional scraps of food fall to the floor the kids quickly scavenge them and either pop the meager contents into their gaunt mouths or place them inside of a soiled plastic bag.   I don't know what hurt me more the fact that the diners were completely indifferent to the plight of the children or the fact that the kids were shoe less and clearly suffering from the effects of malnutrition.  It is a SIN that the entire world does not unite to wrestle that country out of the grasp of that bloated, porcine generational dictator.  Though I love it, college football makes no sense whatsoever and I remind myself of that by trying to imagine explaining Saturdays at Kyle Field to foreigners. This one is especially absurd to picture. Just imagine taking some half starved official to a non con squash match and telling him about the swag copter while everyone chants for dudes dressed like milk men and a collie. I wear my ring every day but fuck we are fucking weird.  Tell them ""fuck you"", ""that's how"".  Tell them the Great Leader should already know. This university founded by a Korean American man and funded by south korean church donations did nothing but help the regime. The software engineers and scientist trained by the university are working on nuclear programs and cyber attacks against south korea.   It was supposed to be a beacon of change, rather it has become the instrument of tyranny. Only viable change in north korea can come from the removal of kim dynasty. They could ask literally anybody in a medical marijuana state how to build grow houses. Hmm, this could be a good way to reach out to the people of NK. You think they could barter for some good public awareness that Americans are there to help? Earlier the article said Christian university, now its private university. Was it suppose to secrete? We could troll them and ask them how to make nukes in an even trade. No, let the people rebel and make a united Korea.  This is exactly the type of post that shouldn't be climbing in upnvotes. This might actually be illegal. Cant they just hack that info? From the information leaking out North Korea, I want to say to give it to them.  We live in a world where westerners can build nuclear reactors in their basements but these chuckleheads can't manage tractor technology. All their heating oil and fertilizer goes down mineshafts to fake nuclear tests. Every winter they end up resorting to cannibalism. I honestly don't believe you can help people this irrational. Eventually a few of their generals are going to decide they'd like to try 21st century life and they'll feed their pudgy demigod to the dogs. And nothing of value will be lost. You should all read ""Without you there is no us"". Its about a reporter who goes to this university disguised as a teacher, and documents her experiences teaching North Korea's future leaders. Knowledge knows no borders.  They legally cannot help them. Unless they want to deal with ofac Fucking them in the ass.  I hope they don't. Maybe they should quit investing money in rockets and feed their people first.. then let's talk.  Expect new leaders any day now I whish the US would've invaded North korea instead of Iraq.  A few weeks later, a frantic call to an aggie.   ""All our crops have turned a weird red brownish color!""   ""Whoop!""   ""It is our leader's most hated color, they are coming to kill me!""  ""Ah this is why Fred said it was a bad idea."" Not a tough call at all. Let's not prop up a shitty regime. Let them fail and collapse just like the soviet union.  I've got plenty to brag about. Especially now that we are going to take part of your PUF's ^_^ suck on that you inbred redneck  TOO....FUCKING....BAD.... The Martian made me an expert on this. All you need is some poop, potatoes, and moisture I reject the premise that there are any private institutions in North Korea, least of all free thinking academia. this is sad. Communist nations are always economic basket-cases. Look at the Holodomor for example. Step one.  Capitalism.  Step two.  democracy, preferable some kind of constitutional republic.   Step three.  Sit on toilet with fresh drinking water, shit into the water, finally make a horrible comment somewhere online. Plant up! Sky gardens basically as you'd have ten rows up and ten rows across vs just ten rows across on the ground. 10x the production of the same bit of land. And yes take a little bit to construct but the yield out weighs the effort :)  Solution to fix North Korea: stop trying to ""fix"" them/putting excessive western pressure on them so they ease down on the military and relax themselves enough to focus more on their people starvation problem   They'll sort themselves out   Also just give them the food  TAMU offers a degree in chickens... no lie, look it up. ""Poultry science""  Go Coogs [removed] I wouldn't wish an Aggie on anyone I met Jeremy Hunter only a few years ago. From his accounts: yep, NK is an absolute shithole for food.   I'm going to go with: the government's going to take it either ways.  I'd be wary of anyone choosing the answer too fast. This sort of thing should be very hard to decide on. He looks at for a map It's not like the topic of teaching is going to be how to raise proper geese for foie gras or how to massage a cow to get that Kobe marbling pattern, it's going to be how to more efficiently grow grain or what have you.  And if you teach farmers to increase their crop yield by 10% that WILL have an effect on their local communities.  I mean even if it all went to the military, that's still ~25% of their population and 99% of them are just regular people with a uniform. There was an article last week about a defector claiming North Korea's ruling class are starting to turn on Kim Jong-un. A positive influence from Americans, who are typically portrayed as evil in North Korea, could help push that resistance further. Plus, it will probably help some of North Korea's poor. I'd go with just giving them the food.  I'm not sure the absence or existence of food makes the difference it would have in a World War I economy.  Either way, the leadership and the army will get their food.  In the end it's probably better to just minimize the suffering.  The population is probably in a better position to overthrow their masters if they're not having to think about surviving. He has been under pressure to feed the military better. :( They will likely take it, but it will probably still end up with more food for the common citizen in the country, so its like a Win-Lose kinda option. It's not a moral dilemma at all. A lot of North Koreas food problem is growing conditions it also shows that communist nations and capitalist nations don't need to be in constant tension. If they start growing enough food the Leadership couldn't steal it all and the military doesn't get the a lot of food either nobody really gets too much food No, thousands of north koreans aren't starving and suffering... millions are. Any amount of exposure to the outside world will slowly corrode the regime. If helping NK here will save lives, defuse hunger induced tensions and chip away on the culture wall then I'm all for helping NK in the short run. North Korea has received aids from outside world - South korea, US, EU and etc. Food aids supposed to help the starving mass were largely diverted to military. There is no transparency in aid distribution.   The regime would have collapsed if it weren't for the massive aid by south korea. Short sighted aid is only prolonging the suffering of people. Now china is not enforcing sanctions, so no end in sight.   If the regime wants to feed the people, it has the means. They have $$$ to develop nukes and ICBMs. But they would let people starve to death than give up nukes and ICBMs. If the improvement is big enough, the food grown will not only go to the labouring cattle, but also to the military. The populace is in third place.  The military are people too, you know. And fatty kim can only eat so much before he gets stuffed. Even if he uses top quality ingredients as soup stock and then throw it away or something outrageous like that, he can still only consume so much. If the production is significantly increased, the normal people will definitely at least get something...  hopefully. Your close on your second scenario. Kim will definitely steal all the food for himself, but your crazy if you think he'd share any of it with anyone else  Well don't worry. I can assure you Texas has no plans to help North Korea  I don't see a moral dilemma. It's a request for information. Well if we read the history of how the north and south came to be, it's enough to make us all conflicted.  I feel like getting North Korea back on their feet might be the only way to fight back the dictatorship there. If we help them, then some Koreans might see that not all Americans are bad, and that their teachings have been false. However, there's also a chance that we help them and the people thank their ""god"" for granting them more crops. It's a risk that has a small chance of paying off in the long run in my opinion. As long as you help the people, you'll weaken the NK dictatorahip. Not giving them the information has no chance of helping them, while giving it has one. I don't see a complicated moral dilemma. NK really isn't that much of a threat to other countries like it is to its own population.  No dilemma, they should definitely collaborate. I know a couple of former East German science students and they said that their access to the west through the university system allowed them to understand how different the rest of the world was and gave them hope for a better, post-communist future. The same would equally be true for North Korean scientists in this collaboration. Ideally we want as many North Koreans exposed to the outside world in any way possible, so that when the inevitable collapse of the regime happens it's citizens will be a prepared as possible for reintegration. No kidding. After reading this i had the exact same thought.  I would have no idea what to do Maybe if we help them they might realize we all shouldn't burn in hell like Kim teaches.  Probably the latter Hopefully, it will empower the people, relying less on Kim Jong Un, and hopefully one day garner enough strength to topple him over. Not only food aid to NK not given to the starving people, it was SOLD by the military.  This is why NK absolutely demands that they be in charge of distribution of food, not the foreign NGO's. But as an American you must surely believe in trickle down economics, surely it will reach the NK poor eventually!  /s > many starving to death  You are thinking back to the great famine. Actual starvation to this extend is not happening in the DPRK anymore. They are just poor. Kids not having thick enough jackets in -20C winters is totally normal, starvation is not.  I wish American would invade them and take their oil. Feeding people is always a good thing. If we are giving Palestinians millions when they cheered on 9/11, then yeah, let's feed starving NORKs.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactions_to_the_September_11_attacks#Palestinian_celebrations ""It's more like a test. We just want to see if you know as much as us."" ""just to name something."" > that are destroying the country.   Are they really destroying it? Isn't it pretty thoroughly destroyed? Seems like they're just kind of ruling over the rubble.  > The university is directly tied to the ruling class that are destroying the country.  Because the international community is not by embargoing them? You must have reached pretty far to pull that out of your ass.  Edit: thought you were talking about A&M not the NK  one. Sorry about that.  If you went to A&M you'd know it's much more complicated than that. :) if it was that simple North Korea wouldn't be starving. The problem is the north has very little arable land. Traditionally, the north of Korea was the developed industrial zone while the south produced all the food (as it had all the arable land). When the country split in half suddenly the food production base was separated from the industrial production base. In the 50s and 60s North Korea actually had a better standard of living than the south as they produced all the goods and obtained their food from friendly countries. It is only when North Korea lost all it's friends due to regime change that things became really shitty really fast. Instructions unclear, dick stuck in labor camp for three generations That makes a bit of sense, hire the college that is the leader in agriculture in Texas, and home of the most recipients of the CMH, oh yeah and the Bush School for political science is regarded as one of the best schools to learn the super secret squirrel shit of CIA ""politics"".   Plant some seeds, start a revolution, topple government, call for harvesters.   That's the Aggie way. Yeah fuck new Jersey.  That is why this collaboration should go ahead. Starving the country has no effect on the regime apparatus. If it did the country would have collapsed long ago. So the most humane solution is to collaborate and hope that the interaction and exposure to the outside world slowly softens the regime over time. It worked with China, which is a much better place to live now than in the 50s and 60s. Even the USSR thought the communist government in China was too extreme back then, and essentially cut ties with China altogether. Many scientists and agronomists went to help north korean agriculture already. Super yielding corns and what not. It's the system of repression and military first policy making any progress impossible. South korea was poorer than north korea. Trades and openness bring prosperity. Only solution is bring an end to the tyranny.  I think a lot of US schools have campuses in Qatar. At least I know VCU does as well. North Korea or Texas ? Current grad student here, Gig Em! SAME HERE!  And not what I would've expected haha TIL internet can substitute decades of teaching and studying on academic level. A-A-A-whoop! . Aha! Took a while, but I got through to Google translate.  But why Japanese, though? You from [kulak](https://reddit.com/r/SiberianGulag) also?!   Is vary kold.  Freedom is the best fertilizer For real. Want to stop famines? Liberalize your economy. If worked for Russia. Also allow imports of food (and fertilizer and industrial farm equipment) and allow prices to signal what society demands. You can still be a dictator and do this (well at least for awhile, because the Hayek-Friedman hypothesis says that liberal economies inevitably lead to democracy).   Mainly because when you have to deal with the US health care system you'd better have the dollar sign or your next best choice is the gun.  Mostly because the current US healthcare at least is all about the former being given patients by the latter.  Everyone there sounds like one of those fake girl accounts for Korean Communism. If stories are to be believed, the NK Elite are slowly turning their back on their ""Dear Leader"". Then again that could just be some bullshit fluff news invented by the US to put pressure on NK. People are probably getting pretty hangry over there.   A video you don't have a link about (and I doubt if it exist happened in the last 2 decades) I guess, like all the studies and articles people in this thread don't have. Brothers went to A&M. Can confirm, Aggies are so damn weird. But I'll be damned if I didn't enjoy visiting College Station. are you kidding me?  I say let them be. If you constantly pressure and look over the shoulder of a child who's working they'll get aggravated/anxious. Leave them be and let them work on the problem themselves, whether or not you think you have the answer.  Will take a look. Thanks for letting us know!  Yeah because we had all that before agriculture /s A&M isnt the only school that has this program and Von Miller is a Poultry Science major so Gig' em haha  Also you went to fucking Houston. You have nothing to brag about bud. I would assume they're asking for the expertise of the faculty, not asking for A&M to recreate North Korea in College Station.  Yes we are one of the largest schools, but we are pretty highly respected in terms of agriculture and engineering. We also boast the largest Kinesiology program in the country as well as the Mays Business School. Despite the Aggie joked, this is a top tier university and rightly so. Because of the expertise of Texas A&M professors like Nobel Peace Prize winner  [Norman Borlaug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug), who was credited with saving millions of people from famine through his research in agriculture-- research that the ag department continues today. You do realize what that ""A"" stands for, right? Would you ask your dentist for advice on repairing your car? Famine and global politics is bigger than your silly football rivalry.  Because??? That seems exactly like what will happen. However, I do feel that there's a better chance for more to be left for the civilians -after the government takes their lion's share- if that information was shared with them.  I definitely don't want to see NK gain any advantages that would strengthen their military or oppressive regime in any way, but the conditions that people are forced to live in over there are already pretty grim.  Tough call either way. Someone tried something similar (helping with the food shortage), a German guy sent a few of his giant rabbits that he had bred specifically for consumption (they really were huge, not like some tiny bunny in a cage) to North Korea so they could be raised to help the people.  Supposedly, Kim Jong Il ate them for his birthday. Might as well help them out for the chance it would reach the populace.  In one scenario, they're fucked.  In the other scenario there's a possibility they're less fucked.  Might as well go with option b. > NK is an absolute shithole for food  well, you are somewhat right. A lot of people don't have a balanced or even merely interesting diet, especially in the countryside.  I always think of it like enabling a drug user.  We need to make them hit true rock bottom.  It sucks that they're suffering, but if nothing changes they will always be suffering. I'd rather more suffering in the short term to have less suffering later, but that's extremely easy for me to say half way across the world with a full stomach and roof over my head.    The worlds current treatment of n Korea, while it makes sense due to their propaganda and aggression towards everyone, is obviously not working.   We should provide education, if they're asking for aid we should give it. Especially if is just pdfs and power point. They had pasta sauce but no pasta? Honestly it's a much better alternative than sending aide, which will most definitely go towards funding the regimes pocketbooks.  The ruling class have been ""starting to turn on the regime"" for decades now. Defectors have been saying this since Kim-Il Sung was alive.   Not trying to discredit the defectors, but they don't know the full story and this claim has yet to show and indication of it being true. Perhaps the North Korean people are fed rumors about inner-government strife, in order to maintain the illusion that they have more choice and opportunities than they actually have? We don't know.  If we give them farming techniques, they won't say they got it from the americans. They will say it was invented at the school in pyongyang. And anyone who says otherwise will be arrested or killed for lying. People have been saying this kind of thing for years. I think, if it were going to happen, it already would have. (Probably right after Kim \#2 died.) At this point I expect the north korean regime to stay in power at least until China decides to abandon it, which is likely to be a while yet. Or a food shortage could incentivize those who are already unhappy with the regime, while food aid -distributed by those in power- undoes the work in progress. > North Korea's ruling class are starting to turn on Kim Jong-un.  Kim III did his purges with the specific intent to eliminate pro-Chinese leaders who would have undertaken a coup against him. Survival is the reason for rebellion.  If the government is taught to farm, then they will be able to use it to feed *some* of the starving and quell rebellion.  And by teaching a ""private"" university farming techniques, you are teaching the elites, the same ones in the government.  The US tried to take a different approach. Send them food with the US flag covering every bag in every crate in every shipment. The NK government forced people to turn in the US food bag for a NK *rebranded* food bag. Essentially, they just repackaged all of the US food aid.  Essentially, the best thing to do is to enforce super high tariffs on the elites. As long as they can still drink their cognac, they will continue to oppress their people. And continue to blast K-pop across the DMZ. Actually, I wonder if it would be good to allow only a few luxury goods to be traded across the border. That would piss lots of people off if the elites could get super luxury items and the poor got nothing. Most of the Kim regime's grasp on power is that their people are suffering, but they direct the blame to the Capitalists, mostly the United States. The government keeps the population in poverty so they can keep shifting the blame to an external threat, but not so much that the people's only choice is to try their luck with revolt.  That's not how it works, though. The regime isn't even *trying* to distribute all of the food. On the contrary, it's trying to use lack of food as a means of control over the populace. North Korea could increase its farm outputs by a factor of ten overnight, and the new 90% extra would either be traded away for more weapons or simply destroyed to keep it out of the hands of the lower classes. I know the military are people. However, that doesn't change the fact that maintaining a strong military is part of how North Korea continues to subjugate their people.   Part of this is because military members and families are given preferential treatment and more resources than others. This basically results in people joining the military and helping maintain oppression just to feed themselves.  Like I said, it's a tough choice to make. If giving North Korea this aid only winds up strengthening their means of oppression (which it usually does), then does this really do any good?   the production cannot be increased under current regime while all resources are being channeled to building nukes and ICBMs. people need to get trickle down crumbs while kims and military get fat all the while the aid is intended for hungry people? Which planet are you from? I think it's wishful thinking that the people will wind up overthrowing Kim Jong Un. What's more likely is that someone already high-up, or a group of high ranking people will conspire against him and seize power for themselves. At this point things might improve, stay the same, or even get worse (if that's possible). We can only guess.  Our Dear Leader wants to know how far you've come along.  ""We know already, we're just making sure you know."" North Korea is still very resource rich in terms of minerals so there is a lot of wealth. The land is good but the way they farm and mine is so old that is wasteful.   The thing is.. with proper leadership they won't have to be rubble. So  the elites/Kim are actively keeping their people poor.  The Kims are rich beyond comprehension. Like forbes list rich.  Do they often overthrow dictators at A&M? Sounds like a plan for vertical farming. It doesn't require large amounts of land and is more water efficient. Lol, my bad  > It's the system of repression and military first policy making any progress impossible.  Pretty much this. We teach them to grow more food, the military takes it all. We give them tractors to help plow fields, the military takes them. We give them aid to help ease their famine, the military takes it all, cuts the 'US Aid' logo off and then says they're the only ones who can provide for the people. 6 American universities are there; VCU, Carnegie Mellon, Texas A&M (whoop and gig em) Cornell, Georgetown and Northwestern.    There is no curriculum overlap and each school concentrates on (one of) its specialties. For example Texas A&M only offers degrees in engineering.  Indeed.  Take a look at [this google maps link](https://goo.gl/maps/tb9aGxf2mzk).  If you zoom in a little, you can see VCU, TAMU, Cornell, Carnegie Melon, Georgetown and Northwestern all have some presence there. Don't mess with north korea. Long live the fat ass leader! The real question is who commands a larger cult, yell leaders of Kim Jong-un? Took you this long? I can be an expert on anything in a couple hours. I went to a meeting with a bunch of A&M peeps, and they were all ""whooping"" after someone mentioned their school. Is this common lol  That's rich, coming from a TEASIP!  (*he says, while drinking a cup of tea*) haha, just do google / duckduckgo research. That's the words that came to my mind at this moment, and it happens to be the only asian language I know. I don't know if Friedman would say it's inevitable, but he does contend that a free market is a necessary component of a democracy. If I have to question if a place is real or a parody, I always assume parody. r/Pyongyang is one of those places I am still very uncertain of. Welcome to North Korea 1. Excess will be traded away to China i would imagine  I don't disagree with any of this.  But there is a flip side to this coin.    I don't know anything at all about agriculture, farming or F&M university.  With the possible exception that I know the are an upstanding and respected university.  It seems to me that this would be an ideal opportunity for them to learn new methods and improve on whatever time tested methods of agriculture they think should be employed in a situation like this.  I mean, this is a pretty good learning opportunity for F&M.  Kind of unique.    No, the NKorean government cannot be trusted.  But there is nothing going on here that hasn't happened before, what we learn from here we can use in the future.   There's a small chance that the researchers that learn how to grow the food may take their knowledge and pass it on to the people of NK. If the people learn how to make food then they can eat before Kim comes and takes it for himself.  I say yes for moral reasons. I'm sorry, but I am willing to suffer the North Korean army eating well if it means some starving anyone can get a proper meal. Call me naive, I don't care.   e: What I'm trying to say is I don't believe *anyone* should be kept from these technologies. I like to think that if the people of North Korea see the surplus food being produced by their hands and still get the same pittance it would foment better grounds for their revolution.  Wow..I don't disbelieve you. But do you happen to have a source for that ? :/   That bastard Fatty Kim.  > We need to make them hit true rock bottom.   Just to be clear. You're saying you want possibly millions of people to die, rather than us to step in and help innocent victims of the regime in power. (""Step in"" with knowledge, not weapons.) But in this case it's like the drug user has kids and, even if it's just short-term, if you don't support the drug user then the kids could suffer. It's not an easy decision. > I always think of it like enabling a drug user. We need to make them hit true rock bottom  Somehow I feel like history implies that this approach will not work with North Korea. How much lower are they supposed to go? Right on the money. Aid only helps Kim Jong Un build more nukes and missiles and kidnap more japanese and south koreans.  If the North Koreans are unhappy enough, they'll revolt. Unless NK provokes someone and is invaded, that's the most we can hope for It has been proven that a drug user ""hitting rock bottom"" is not essential for their long-term recovery >  We need to make them hit true rock bottom.  They did in the 90s. He chose a book for reading >Perhaps the North Korean people are fed rumors about inner-government strife, in order to maintain the illusion that they have more choice and opportunities than they actually have?  Unlikely. As far as I know that's a bad propaganda move for that sort of regime. You specifically *don't* want people thinking they have choice or opportunities. You want them to feel dependent on the good will of the state for their survival. Creating an impression of government unrest just gives the lower classes ideas, which is dangerous and counterproductive. The defector in this case is [North Korea's former deputy ambassador to London](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/25/north-korean-elite-turning-against-kim-jong-un-defector-thae-yong-ho), so he probably would legitimately know if North Korea's ruling class are turning on Kim Jong-un. I doubt they'd be able to suppress the knowledge that Americans taught them useful farming techniques, especially since it would be very likely that a dozen or so people would be taught initially. There's already lots of food (often rice) that's sent form the US to NK through the world food program and other avenues. North Korea simply tells their citizens that the US flag on the rice bags is tribute or war reparations that the US pays to NK.  This is how it has happened the last decades.   > enforce super high tariffs on the elites  That's difficult to enforce. The elite is small. And this is a sovereign nation with a white water merchant navy. They can smuggle anything from anywhere. At least for luxury good smuggling is no big hurdle. I don't think the government actively wants to keep the population in poverty. It's more that they are incapable for many reasons. E.g. the state ideology basically says dear leader can't do anything wrong. So there's no good avenue for improving the system and the conditions. Especially if you're in a semi influential position, you have to be super loyal. You don't want to risk to send your family to a concentration camp for criticising state policy.

You are now a moderator of /r/Pyongyang In case we need help? Kim is such a nice guy! ""you tell us your methods first and we'll tell you if you're right or wrong. But, speak slowly and clearly so I can follow along."" You don't even need natural resources to be a wealthy country these days. Just a competent leadership that follows mainstream economics. North Korean soil is pretty shit and has very low yield without fertilizer. The soviets collapsing and no longer supplying them with fertilizer was what led to about 1 mil dying of starvation back in the early 90's. Per wikipedia ""During World War II, Texas A&M produced over 20,000 combat troops, contributing more officers than both the United States Military Academy and United States Naval Academy combined."" They literally have an OG Bush library, so ... I'm sure the cadets in their Corps would love to overthrow Fat Kim III. They could make it a class project. Free senior boots for everyone if they succeed! I wish US, South Korea or Japan launch a single cruise missile aimed not at a building not at military installation, but at the gigantic statue of Kim Sr. at the center of pyongyang. Then say oops sorry my bad. But masses will realize Kims are not gods after all. It will be better than any propaganda and the regime will fall within a year. Yeah I think VCU is for the arts if I remember correctly. It's an aggie tradition^^^TM Ohhhh yes it is lol. We're low key a cult (best cult there is) It's likely a role playing sub, like /r/nosleep, where you have to stay in charecter and no one is allowed to suggest any story is fake in any way. I wonder if government officials in North Korea are reading it, thinking they have support of glorious Juche followers all over the world. Xi Jinping takes what Xi Jinping wants when Xi Jinping wants. But some will be managed to slip to those suffering. So I guess you could go for it for that and the eventual uprising will have a good supply and knowledge of how to grow it A&M, not F&M. Its not that simple to just pass on knowledge about farming. I work as an Agronomist/Crop Consultant and there are many variables you have to consider when growing crops. While I believe NK could grow grain crops (corn, beans, wheat), I doubt they have the ability to grow high input/dollar crops such as Nuts, Fruits, or Veggies. And there in lies the problem with grain storage. Do they have the capacity to hold or store the grain without shrink/spoilage? Do they even have the ability to process the grain? There are more variables that go into this kind of thing than people give credit for, but what it really boils down to is that the people of NK are going to continue to starve because NK has closed off trade. They are slowly starving themselves, and they have no answer for what to do. Being proud in being naive is ridiculous. Don't ever act as if being naive and moral is a good thing, it's a shitty thing.   Honestly, the hunger the people feel should make them rise and overthrow their government. By helping them we're aiding the government keep control. These people need a revolution... >A German rabbit breeder who sold 12 rabbits to North Korea to breed giant bunnies said he won't be exporting any more to the reclusive communist country because he suspects they have been eaten.  http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/german-breeder-furious-over-cancelled-trip-no-more-monster-bunnies-for-north-korea-a-475218.html  >Szmolinsky said he suspected that his rabbits, which grow to the size of dogs and can weigh more than 22 pounds, were eaten at a birthday banquet for Kim Jong-Il, the North Korean leader, although he emphasized that he had no evidence of this.  >Its an assumption, not an assertion, Szmolinsky said. But I dont think the animals are alive anymore, I think theyve been eaten.  http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/04/05/kim-jong-il-suspected-eating-giant-rabbits-sent-to-feed-starving-north-koreans.html  It's conjecture, but the rabbits were sold in January and Kim Jong Il's birthday was on February 16 (and was kind of a [big deal](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1357614/Kim-Jong-Ils-son-skips-fathers-69th-birthday-Eric-Clapton-gig.html) in NK), so the timeline matches up.  So while there was never any official confirmation as to what happened, the North Koreans canceled the guy's trip to see his rabbits when he was supposed to go there and give them some pointers on rising them. This was nearly 10 years ago, and as far as I know they still aren't farming giant rabbits in NK. But how can you do that without starting a war? If the West sends aid, it will be taken and strengthen the authritarian regime. The $64,000 question is 'Are these people destined to die anyways?'  Specifically what people are apprehensive about is the possibility that the government will take this food for exclusive use of the army and government and not share it with the population - who would end up dying anyways.  It is a really good question.  I don't see a clear moral line in the sand for this.  My vote is we give them the rope they need to hang themselves.  F&M can learn from this opportunity, if the people die anyways there really won't be a way to spin this.  And if we are all wrong then TERRIFIC!  Sometimes being wrong is good. There was a study a while ago - the second safest option for the world as a whole is to literally genocide the country. the explanation was something like: we can't let the get far enough to have ICBM's, America can't do a regime change because China, China can't do a regime change because America, they can't work together to dismantle the military then put the Swiss in charge because it would make it look like they needed help or something, and nobody in the immediate area wants to deal with a nation of undereducated, indoctrinated, unskilled refugees.  Edit: Fuck if i know where it came from, it was linked somewhere here in the last month or so.   Damned if you do, damned if you don't. This is truly a horrible decision but I do feel that our policies should be preventing further regime entrenchment. Giving aid usually ends up doing just that. The regime takes their shares and uses it to pay off cronies. > but that's extremely easy for me to say half way across the world with a full stomach and roof over my head.   First read all his post before commenting. Yep. That herd could use some thinning anyway.  Yeah, but the drug user also regularly beats the shit out of his kids, and doesn't really use what you give him to take better care of them. You can try to help the kids at certain points, but ultimately the only way they're going to escape their terrible lives is by being removed from their abusive household.  either few more years of suffering by the kid or life time of suffering. And if you help the addict, he becomes an armed with machine gun addict. Until they can't pay off the army anymore I think you're over estimating things a bit. He's certainly more in-the-know than the commoners and border guards that defected, but even he doesn't know the full story. Dictatorships keep their power by keeping all information on a need-to-know basis, and we have enough reports to believe the same is done in North Korea.   Maybe he's heard hopeful rumors or had people approach him to participate in or counter a conspiracy against Kim, but it really doesn't tell the whole story.   I'm just saying we should be skeptical of such claims. Not because they might be wrong, but because nobody knows what's really going on except the very top people.  You'd be suprised. There's a great movie on netflix. A doc where a doctor and team go to north Korea to perform cataract surgeries on something like 200 people. At the end when they are ready to take off their bandages. They do it ceremoniously in a church to their god king. The doctor and team are given passing subdued acknowledgement as merely the handmaidens of the will of their omnipotent lord and savior's amazing wisdom and compassion as they each cry and weep openly in praise of their god kings blessing.  Fatty Kim?!   Oshit!   I'm Gulaged now, aren't I?  ""Thank you for your steps, USA. Unfortunately, the steps you have been using to make your nuclear weapons are actually incorrect, and to prevent further problems we believe that you should dismantle all of your nuclear weapons, or even give them all to use so we can fix them for you :)   xoxo Kim Jong-un"" They do help however, especially if there is potential for rare earth metals in North Korea.  I don't know what you mean by 'these days', but this has been true for a long time now. Centuries, maybe millennia. The one who tried to overthrow and install a fascism regime? Or just the 41st president? No, that would give them the feeling that the US would come to bomb them AGAIN - the former bombing of NK by the US probably killed 20% of the population:  https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-us-war-crime-north-korea-wont-forget/2015/03/20/fb525694-ce80-11e4-8c54-ffb5ba6f2f69_story.html  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Pyongyang There's nothing lowkey about it. But we're absolutely the best cult there is That's why I don't see this working. Only room for one cult in best korea. That's what I thought about /r/The_Donald at first. No joke. A good explanation! - I had been wondering about nosleep, but seeing it as roleplay makes sense. Xi gonna Xi Xi Jinping doesn't do what Xi Jinping does for Xi Jinping. Xi Jinping does what Xi Jinping does because Xi Jinping is Xi Jinping. You talk like those in power in NK have a heart. Kim kills them F&M is a local college.  I used to live across the street from it. I don't disagree. It's why I said there was a small chance. The likelihood of it actually happening would be unlikely. I'm not proud I am naive, I just don't care if you think I am. I would counter that you are a repugnant cynic. > although he emphasized that he had no evidence of this. > Its an assumption, not an assertion, Szmolinsky said. But I dont think the animals are alive anymore, I think theyve been eaten.  Oh..  By the way they bought the rabbits, can't they do what they want with them? Pressure china to end the aid. South korea and japan stopped aid and cash payment to north. Only china does. china's rationale is if north korea falls, it will face a free democratic nation at its border. thus it needs a buffer. Nobody is threatening china, so china needs to wake up from dilussion or better yet if there is democratic china, north korea will no longer be an issue. > There was a study a while ago  What study? >**There was a study a while ago** - the second safest option for the world as a whole is to literally genocide the country. the explanation was something like: we can't let the get far enough to have ICBM's, America can't do a regime change because China, China can't do a regime change because America, they can't work together to dismantle the military then put the Swiss in charge because it would make it look like they needed help or something, and nobody in the immediate area wants to deal with a nation of undereducated, indoctrinated, unskilled refugees.  Sounds totally legit! You convinced me!  I would love to read this Well, that is the dumbest thing I have read today on the internet and I have seen some pretty dumb stuff. You have some fantasy man. You are talking about 23 million people whose only faults are being born in the wrong country. US, South Korea, Japan and west never threatened North korea. North korea is the aggressor and villain, but china is just playing geopolitical game of supporting this scum of earth dictator like china helped Khmer rouge massacred millions cambodians. The drug user will sell the foidstamps ypu gave to support his kids to buy more meth, polish his guns to potential functionality and go on a liquor store robbing spree with the kids piled in the back of the hoopdey proclaiming his omnipotent badassery and mmmmmmaybe they get a scrap. But thing #1 is he's going to flex and fuel his legend. And that's what we can't have. Except in this case, support is the equivalent of permission and the push of a button And that documentary is clearly propaganda. [Interviews with North Korean defectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhmzpMP3bEE) clearly suggest that sort of stuff is all for show. If China is any indicator, you bet your sweet tits Best Korea has all that magnesium and whatnot. There is potential for rare earth extraction practically any where it just so is that china has been dumping rare earths on the marked for decades. kim jong un is a chicken shit. When he sees his grand daddy's statue crumbling, he will get his ass out of north korea in a heart beat along with his barbie doll prostitutes. It does not have to an US missile. SK or Japan can do it nicely. If very well could be.  I'm not a fan of that sort of thing, so I have no idea if it's legit or not.  Hell, to be honest, I don't believe anything I read on Reddit, nor should anyone else beleive anything. People seem to take it too seriously though with all sorts of strange results. When I first stumbled on to it, I was confused as all hell. Didn't help that I was on mobile and the sidebars didn't show up on the app I was using.  I was confused as hell as to how many people seemed to legitimately believe completely impossible stuff was real. Made zero sense until I read the rules about commenting in character and keeping everything as ""true"" to the story.  I assume /r/Pyongyang is the same, without the explicit rules laid out. I think that's a part of the fun. Leave a tongue in cheek comment there with the standard verbiage and they play along---go ""off"" character and the ban hammer mercilessly comes down. And the article is talking about A&M Well I don't care if you think I'm repugnant. I'm still right and you're still living in some delusional fantasy land where your good intentions = good results. Well,  it was bought using public funds for the people. Also, they got a severe discount (80 per rabbit instead of  200-250) as the guy who was selling them wanted to help the people suffering from the food shortage, so they negotiated that in bad faith as well. The international community has been pressuring China to stop enabling Fat boy for years now with only success at face value  No. Americans and Japanese need to wake up from the *delusion* that China is threatening them.  **THE** study.  Are you deaf?   Just read his mind, a lot of fantasy. I dunno. 2017 has been a moronic sitcom version of 2016z Feel free to say something better instead of calling it dumb, because ironically your comment is the dumbest and most useless thing I've read all day.  The whole point is no matter how much you pity them, no one wants to deal with the aftermath. So what is your genius idea? So how do you suppose we stop NK from nuking SK + Japan? He did say the *second* safest option is the slow and painful death of millions of innocent people. Maybe the *first* safest option is just...half the genocide?  Something like a trade embargo as ""punishment"" for a government we don't like is one thing--literally denying food to starving men, women, and children is something else, IMHO. You're making it sound like that is very different from how western governments behave [removed] Because it can be done naturally.  Yeah you don't want the Chinese to have a monopoly on that. Yeah war is not that easy.  You are a strange one. I didn't have the article in front of me.  And I lived across the street from the place.  And my Father in law retired from the place.  So it was a pretty natural mistake for me to make. > Well, it was bought using public funds for the people.  Source? fat boy is getting fatter. Hopefully Trump means business when it comes the fat boy. trump got attention of china by questioning one china policy.  Then, china should abide by international laws and UN mandates. Stop aiding North Korea. Then everybody is happy except the fat pig. > no one wants to deal with the aftermath.  Aftermath, of what? Maybe if you had an ounce of compassion (an emotion humans have) you would find it stupid to even think about genocide being a solution. Koreans are not livestock. By chopping the snake head. There was a rumor that Mosad was behind the massive explosion in north korea aimed at kim jong il (current kim's daddy). Supposedly North was helping syrians build nukes. Let Japan invade? It's wishful thinking that food would be given to the peasants.  The food will feed the military and party loyalists most likely.  It's a really tough spot.. but you can't bring the nation against the Kims by making their life better under his rule.  Doing so would ~~probably~~ be used as propaganda for the party anyway, as giving them war reparations or tribute to Kim's masterful diplomacy or some shit.. just reaffirming his dictatorship.   that depends how far back in history you want to go back. 100 years ago? Then, you may be right.  Who started the war and who committed the atrocities during the war? It's not the people, but the regime who hates US, Skorea and the free world. What the regime wants is the world to legitimize it and turn blind eye on oppressing its people, illicit activities and annexing South korea.  I am not advocating war. Simply calling for destruction of a statue. I think you misunderstand. Obama's approach to NK was to pressure China into cutting off aid while not negotiating with the NK government. Trump's plan is basically the opposite, ignore China and negotiate with NK. China will top any offer the US gives NK, while giving NK leverage over China by having the possibility of re-aligning themselves with the US. It's not a good strategy for us in my opinion. International law is interesting in that it can't really be enforced. So it's pretty darn meaningless unless we have a unified world government You're attacking him instead of attacking his argument. Contribute an alternative solution or gtfo Stop putting words in my mouth just because you're too emotionally compromised to open your eyes and read. Compassion does not solve world issues, actions does. All lives are sacred, but compassion isn't just saving people. Compassion is choosing the path that ensures the least amount of damage done, no one would choose genocide if they had a choice.  Till now you still haven't contribute anything aside from attacking me, if you have nothing else better to say aside from being naive, stop replying. By assassinating Kim? That would be a declaration of war with China. Why would Israel be involved in that? The Jews aren't behind every lamppost. It was probably a Chinese or internal North Korean operation. China would scream that the US and Japan are working in lockstep formation and acting as one. IDK what they would do but it would be the same as if the US did it. Also I doubt Japan would do it as SK would be the first to get hit anyway so may as well just wait till then if you're Japan. Japan is not allowed to muster an army for offense  [removed] I mean do not get me wrong it would be a freedom boner for that too happen, but that would cause war with China because treaties and politics haha maybe you are right. However strategic patience with north korea not just during Obama years as well as bush and clinton years, simply yielded no result.  People openly advocating for genocide, really? Wake up!  Now I do not have a detailed plan of action and such a large and complex problem has a solution that requires much reflexion by many people. For my part I think opening new trade and  communication channels are an absolute must. Many more elements compose the solution.  Do you not think that it takes little effort and compassion to end up with basically just one word (genocide)? Btw. Yes they are livestock. Every one of us humans are animal livestock thst require maintenance and compassionate care. These aren't separate concepts. It's been clear for a very long time the reason China doesn't want to see North Korea crushed is because they simply don't want to have to deal with the refugees. It's true that these people are both highly malnourished and heavily indoctrinated. Like maximum indoctrination to worship their leader. What's a sollution? Let the cancer keep growing? No. Especially and assuredly not. It's not a matter of compassion. It's a matter of dealing with a poised threat which takes precedence. I'm gonna make a supposition:  There are smarter people than you who know how to deal with this problem without making a genocide.  1 - Do you think the supposition is reasonable?   2 - If yes - Do you think it is a good idea to advocate and progagate ideas favoring a genocide?  For some reason, some people do not realize the weight of words and ideas they convey. Israelis don't take shit from no one. even china is getting tired of kim clan. China going to invade Israel really?  Because north korea was allegedly selling nuclear technology to nations Israel regards as threats. I stated ""rumoured"". US or South korea at the time had no interests or immediate needs to kill kim jong il. Kims fear death so much they travel in trains. The explosion according to satelite images had signs of bombing (crater) and the timing of explosion was so precise. Not precise enough, since it missed the target. But whereabouts of kims are state secret in north korea. There was a purge afterward and etc. shortly after there was a bombing of reactor site in Syria by IDF. Israel denied. Some north korean workers and scientists were killed. Makes a great spy story. Yes we are Offensive defence? To assist allies, yes, now they are. Thinking US and South Korea committed atrocities is like liberating jews from death camps was committing atrocities against germans.

Another point towards the ""is not china"" column too I guess. Taiwan was amazingly accepting of gay people, it was really great to see. Not so great with black people though.

Same-sex marriage and protection for sexual minorities were to be included in the new Nepalese Constitution required to be completed by 31 May 2012. However, the Legislature was unable to agree on the Constitution before the deadline and was dissolved after the Supreme Court ruled that the term could not be extended.  >In October 2016, the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare constituted a committee for the purpose of preparing a draft bill to legalize same-sex marriage. If a country is concerned about overpopulation, it ought to be allowing or encouraging homosexuality. Taiwans president hovers around 30% approval right now. She was elected to roll back neoliberal attacks on workers. Instead her government is moving to cut 7 paid holidays for private sector workers and introduce up to a 12-day workweek for people in certain professions. They campaigned on a 5 day work week.

Man if only people would support Taiwan all the time and ignore the one China policy. Full support from me.  Tiwan number one! Real China is about to show Asia how it's done! Taiwan has always been very progressive and forward-thinking, General Tso's chicken was invented there. Nepal is an Asian country. We allowed same sex marriage and even identify trans as a gender in citizenship.  ...? [Vietnam](http://time.com/4184240/same-sex-gay-lgbt-marriage-ban-lifted-vietnam/) legalized same-sex marriage two years ago? Taiwan is the one true China, fight me. ""Taiwan being the first Asian country""  Be careful using that C word. There may be main landers in the comments. If fucking Taiwan beats my country (backwards ass australia) holy fucking shit... Looks good to me :) Go Taiwan! Love ur food, would love to visit one day. Wonder what the mainlands answer is going to be to the Chinese Taipei doing this.  American here with family history coming from Taiwan (AKA REAL China), I am proud of this... even though I'm not a citizen and have no influence there, I am still proud of this :P Taiwan is a rogue province of china, so really its china that's going to be the first country with same sex marriage!  Edit: am Taiwanese. Anything that makes mainlanders mad makes me happy.  Why are gay people so attractive?  wow there's not a single Asian country that doesn't allow same sex marriage? I had no idear By the way, even though there is wide movement about the same sex marriage act. But the act is still far from being passed and turned to law. There are still a lot of debates and concerns about this topic.  I thought reddit didn't support Taiwan's sovereignty? Taiwan to become the first Asian country to allow same sex marriage - maybe that's because Taiwan is way ahead from many other points of view compared with the rest of the Asian countries. Why does this kind of bs keep popping up?   It has not happened yet. Not even close. The bill passed the first reading, but could be blocked on the second. I would love to see it happening, but all the over-optimism is real shitty journalism. Please stop. Isn't this bit old news? I keep seeing ""Taiwan being the first Asian country to allow same-sex marriage"" headline few times few previous months. No new update since. Nice... Good job China! Glad to see things going well in other parts of the world. That's amazing. Rooting for their success. TAIWAN NUMBER WAAN A province ain't a country.. Already legal in parts of Japan Even if you hate Trump, don't drag Taiwan into this. Taiwan is the most democratic Asian country, even more than Japan and South Korea and also the most liberal and open minded one.  China on the other side is a fascist nation with a communist party opressing the people and play unfair games internationally (in trade, UN politics and by building islands out of reefs in international waters) you'd think it would be thailand with all their ladyboys The more I learn about Taiwan the more I feel that the western world and the international community backed the wrong China.  ""Wtf I like Taiwan now after phonecallgate""-liberals nice, yet western countries refuse to recognize taiwan still. instead they want to be friends with communist china instead. Let's hope that Taiwan remains a sovereign state now that America is taking an isolationist approach, otherwise this initiative probably won't hold yet they just implemented mandatory 5 day work weeks (it was 6) Good god Beijing would not like that title. I thought Japan allowed it as long as it was allowed in your home country. Or is that incorrect?  Good job Taiwan!

Taipei is slowly being isolated and abandoned by other countries for Beijing. She cannot afford to lose military support from the USA.   So she's trying to gain the popular support from the population of the USA and the West by emulating their values. That's why they seem very progressive. So in the event of conflict with Beijing, there would be popular pressure in US to aid Taipei.  I am too. I am South Korean and I really want them to be the forerunners, so that South Korea pays attention to this important matter. Views on LGBTQ society in South Korea has been improving recently, and I really hope that South Korea can become the second country to legalize gay marriage.  I'm surprised. I thought places like Thailand and Philippines already allowed that stuff with them being really lenient with gay and trans people. Jeremy Lin is amazing Looking at you Australia... The only western country to have not made it legal... Taiwan No.1! Well, Taiwan is number 1 J Lin with the Eurostep! Every country has gay people, not every country has black people. It takes decades of an outside race living within a country for them to become normalised within culture. The US has had black people as long as they've had white people and yet there are still issues there. The truth is that Chinese culture had always been accepting of homosexual affection. It wasn't unusual that emperors and other men of means had male companions who doubled as lovers. A literary fancy way of describing homosexual love is called "" love of the torn sleeve"" (), which comes from a story where a gay lover of an emperor had fallen asleep on his sleeve (ancient Chinese clothing had long and airy sleeves), and the emperor, despite his station, cut off his sleeve rather than waking his lover up.   Anti-homosexuality sentiment ironically started in Chinese culture due to Chinese desire to modernize their country in the late 19th and early 20th century. Western culture were imitated because western nations were socially and technologically advanced. This, of course, meant Christian sensibilities and the aversion to homosexuality.   Today in Taiwan and rest of the sinosphere, opposition to homosexuality usually come from the fact that homosexuals are different (therefore non-confirming) and the facts that homosexuals cannot bear kids for their parents, which is deemed a grave sin in Confucianism. Even then, most people are in the line of ""I don't care if people are gay, as long as my children aren't"".  What I'm in Taiwan right now nobody annoyed me about being black . Any specific stories you feel like sharing ?  Edit : a lot of African Americans will feel that the Taiwanese hate them because they come here to work for cram schools to teach English but the Taiwanese won't send their kids to that school if it's not a Caucasian American who does the teaching.  To put things into perspective If you are Taiwanese and do not have the best income and you want the best for your kids, you tend to be a bit ignorant and assume that it's best if your kid gets all the chances he can. Basically they are trying to maximise their return on investment in a messed up ignorant way.  After Obama things are changing a bit just like Lgbt rights things are slow but moving in the right direction. >Not so great with black people though.  I was black and lived in Asia....alot of people parroting stories about asians hating blacks are sprouting some random comment they overheard.  I had zero problems in most and doubt taiwan was any different.... A lot of Asian countries do.  I think it has to do with the fact that they are all very homogenous societies and many go their entire lives never seeing a black person in real life.  It's less about hate, much more about ignorance.  like others have said there's just virtually no exposure for most taiwanese people. once while riding a cab and the driver found out i was from america he asked me if black people only came out at night time and if i ever got spit on while passing by them. if your only ""real"" knowledge of a type of people come from movies and/or the negative experiences people have kept with them you're going to have a very skewed view of things. thats interesting.  ive always heard that black tourists were like idolized in japan and china.  my boss is black and when he goes to china they think he's a basketball player and everyone is super nice to him and wants to get photos Really?? There's actually a black guy from the states that is actually very popular on a talkshow in Taiwan  What about gay Black people? My grandma said she didn't like black people, but she's never met one. I feel its a combination of lack of exposure, and the western media/ideal. Ignorance and from another generation, dunno if younger Taiwanese feels different.   What makes you say that? My brother just landed in Taiwan and he was telling me they were treating him like a super star. One women asked to take six pictures with him. Source for black people claim? I had a black friend that was making 30 something us dollars an hour teaching English Taiwanese pop culture seems pretty accepting of lgbt. One of Taiwan's biggest stars, Jolin Tsai, has the most fabulously lgbt music videos I've ever seen and tours with hunky french men dancing on heels...and I don't think she's even gay.   [MV featuring a pregnant man](https://youtu.be/3N7JIgDdIIE)  [MV about a gay Garden of Eden](https://youtu.be/KhHfi7jYZa4)  [dancing with her men in heels](https://youtu.be/h52pJZ62Hbo)  [more serious one about a lesbian woman whose wife has just passed](https://youtu.be/C7hHofDW2ts)   Taiwan *is* China.  The country is ""Republic of China"", when the communist uprising happened, the Chinese government at the time fled to the island of Taiwan, the communists never bothered going after them.  The only reason we refer to ""Republic of China"" as Taiwan is to not upset ""People's Republic of China"" and because having two Chinas is confusing. I think everyone took this joke too seriously and the toxic communists have come out.  This is true. Im an expat here. This is the nicest place on earth The survey mentioned in that article also suffers from massive selection bias, rendering the results meaningless (in my opinion).  While many people did report that they enjoy life in Taiwan, **the survey failed to include responses from citizens of Indonesia or Vietnam**, but these groups are two of the largest populations of foreign citizens in Taiwan, **far outnumbering citizens of Western countries**.  At the time of the survey (by internations.org), the following pages appeared to not exist:   * https://www.internations.org/taipei-expats/indonesians  * https://www.internations.org/taiwan-expats/indonesians  * https://www.internations.org/taipei-expats/vietnamese  * https://www.internations.org/taiwan-expats/vietnamese  But, oddly enough, there are equivalent pages for London and other places:   * https://www.internations.org/london-expats/indonesians  * https://www.internations.org/london-expats/vietnamese  * https://www.internations.org/new-york-expats/indonesians  * https://www.internations.org/new-york-expats/vietnamese  From a previous thread on the subject:  > Many of the surveys on which these rankings are based are presented in English, and published within English-language news media. This particular ranking seems to have been produced by a English-language website (https://www.internations.org).  > But **the vast majority of foreigners in Taiwan are not from Western countries, and not even from countries where English is spoken as a native language.** I suspect that we'd get different answers if we asked a broader section of foreign citizens, and included people from South East Asian countries such as Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines. Many of my South-East Asian friends have very different experiences to the friendly image portrayed in the media, and often relate to me stories of racism, discrimination and abuse suffered at the hands of their employers, or from people that they encounter in everyday life.  > It's been my personal experience that many Taiwanese people on the whole **are** friendly (just like in many countries all over the world), but there are also some extremely unfriendly people on the island (again, like any other country).  > One particular example that springs to mind is the road system: in my experience it's common for Taiwanese people to be quite aggressive towards one another on the roads, even to the point where some people are willing to risk the safety of others in order to shave a few seconds off their journey. The rights of pedestrians, for example, are often ignored by drivers that don't want to stop, especially outside of Taipei. Is this behaviour friendly? In my own country, I would of course occasionally encounter dangerous driving, but in Taiwan it's a daily occurrence that wears away at you after a while.  > This runs counter to the friendly image that's often portrayed in the international media, but it's often overlooked, in my opinion. (This is possibly again due to selection bias: a large proportion of foreigners from Western countries are located in Taipei, where public transport is better, and it's not as necessary to own a vehicle.)  link to original discussion: https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/50n53g/taiwan_number_1_in_friendliness/ IDK, maybe. i'd say they gotta fake it till they make it but each side is trying so meh  Why should China care about pissing off Communist China? They have Trump now. [removed] [removed] [removed] Whilst this is true, it was fairly remarkable Nepal brought this around in the first place, and since 2008 they've had some serious internal power struggles...I'm happy how open-minded they've been throughout this in regards to LGBT rights :) What's why I suck dick. The planet. Taiwan is actually in the process of pulling a Japan as fertility rates drop and the age demography gets older. Things aren't quite as severe as they are in Japan, but I'm pretty sure that overpopulation is one of the country's least concerns.  Dont jump to conclusions, Taiwan doesn't have an overpopulation issue. In fact, with its majorly declining birth rates, the government is actively encouraging people to have more children.  I think you should do some more research before making baseless claims; birth rates in Taiwan are just about in the negative. I'm curious how she'll pull of a 12 day work week The truth is, other than the China issue, both parties in Taiwan are rather similar and fluid. When they're in power, they're authoritarian. When they're the opposition, they're populist.  Are you saying you don't get weekends off in Taiwan?  I like the fact she's pulling off controversial reforms the previous administrations are afraid to touch for losing popularity. Labor reform is very much needed, as Taiwan workers work some of the longest hours in the world, but any reform is guaranteed to piss off companies and some workers who get most of their pay off overtime.   The same goes for pension reform: Taiwan needs it in order for the three biggest pensions to remain viable for another generation, but no retiree is happy to get their pension cut.  Gay marriage, same deal: piss off a lot of people for doing what needs to be done.  You mean pushing for workers rights. Why. Actually since she got into office they ADDED paid holidays. Like a whole fucking week of them. I know because I work in taiwan Though I do have to point out the greens themselves are divided on this as well. Some of the legislators in the south, backed by the religious groups in the DPP (who originally backed the democracy protests during the martial law) are very uncomfortable with it. And they're in conflict with the social progress wing of the party.  >30%      Yo fam, wtf happened? I've been out of the loop; family calls Tsai a parrot, but I personally know nothing beyond that. It seemed that she was well liked...   Edit: Used some google-fu, seems that she's been fucking up. Yeesh.  Buddhist,  Taoist, 1/5 Non-religious Hasn't Kumintang mostly been depicted as somewhat ""fascist"" though?   I mean, pretty much equally fascist to South Vietnam and South Korea?   Well, atleast South Vietnam dodged that bullet! Good job on letting the North do a full scale invasion, be proud Americans!  ""Thanks to a new law, Vietnam will no longer be able to prohibit same-sex couples from entering into unions. However, the law does not go as far as recognizing same-sex unions and granting LGBT couples with equal marriage rights. Rather, the law more or less turns a blind eye to same-sex unions."" So no, not really. It is human nature to desire that which cannot be obtained. I know right The point is that this will be instituted country wide.  Japan also has the first transsexual politician too. People like to bash Asian countries for their lack of progressiveness, Japan in particular, but just because they don't have laws on books doesn't mean they're not progressive or moving in the right direction. In many ways, Japan is as progressive as the states, and in some ways (like health care), they're ahead of the U.S.  >fascist  Woah there calm down jose china has gotten shit trade deals until very recently in history. the west has always taken advantage of china in areas of trade until china started to be wealthy. and the Philippines and Vietnam built islands long before china could afford to.   you are just making propaganda like the chinese government except going the other way The US has always been the one who trades unfairly. Canada has lost a lot thanks to them. Don't spread lies. China does more for its people than the large majority of governments > fascist nation with a communist party   I just.. simply cannot believe that a normal functioning human being is capable of typing out something so retarded > Taiwan is the most democratic Asian country, even more than Japan  I'd like to know how Taiwan is more democratic than Japan. Japan is about as democratic as a country can get.   Ninja Edit: The **Democacy Index** ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index)). Japan ranks 20th (a full place ahead of the U.S), South Korea ranks 24th while Taiwan ranks 33. Sorry, Taiwan is **not** more democratic. Not even close.  On the corruption index, Taiwan ranks 35. Japan ranks 15th. Japan is the 15th least corrupt country in the world. [Source.](https://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results) I think a lot of people in thailand look down upon that part of their population, it's just confined to certain areas Real liberals should never have supported China's repression of Taiwanese independence in the first place. Painting with a broad brush there eh?  Trump's recognition of Taiwan is one of the few things I have commended him for.  Not all of us are shamelessly partisan!  Half my family fled to Taiwan from China and recognize the importance of Taiwan's sovereignty.  And guess what?  They're still mostly liberal.    I think both sides have a fair share of people who paid absolutely no attention to the situation until it became politicized in the past few months. Liberals don't like China, but pragmatists realize that its counterproductive to antagonize China over just words.  Its like saying ""if you don't want to go to war with North Korea, you must love North Korea!"". No, there is simply no benefit to furthering tensions with China at this point in time.  The people it benefits: the ruling party of Taiwan as a political move. The parties it hurts: Chinese Government, US Government. You know who led the 'free Tibet' rallies in the 90's, right?    psst, it wasn't conservatives.  also you know who was the staunched opponent of China and friend of the Dalai Lama? Long term California senator Barbara Boxer.   Liberals never hated Taiwan.  In fact many of them really want Taiwan to be recognized as a sovereign nation.  But china doesn't and it's been a continuous sticking point with them that other nations don't recognize Taiwan as a legitimate government, and China is quickly becoming one of the biggest global powers.  It was like going to close, but temperamental co-worker's house and hitting on their wife/husband right in front of them.  Oh, I forgot all about that.  Remember when WWIII happened as a result? Me neither. Liberals are not everyone who is left of your ideals. It is not a pejorative term. So stop using it like it is. It just sounds forced and screams ""Let me manipulate you like the puppets you are"" to everyone that hears it.   As to your statement, turns out large groups of people have individual preconceived notions of Taiwan before phonecalls and could it be possible that being liberal has no relationship with that notion?   Liberal group A dislike Taiwan and therefore speaks out, Liberal group B likes Taiwan therefore doesn't. Switch it around.    That doesn't make a lick of sense at all. The people denying Taiwan are pretty openly communist themselves.. People who want Taiwan to remain sovereign, better hope that America doesn't take an isolationist approach, because the chances of Taiwan remaining sovereign without American protection is pretty close to zero. Recognising it in another country is not the same as allowing it to be performed in your own. This may be true but there's also a less cynical domestically political reason.. Taiwan has a sizeable open gay community and people support letting adults marry each other even if they're the same sex. Yeah, but our President just got ripped to shreds by half the voters for speaking to the President of Taiwan on the phone. Don't be so cynical.  Give credit when credit is due.  Taiwan has also been progressive with human rights and demography.  Many of their current political leaders have been jailed or worst in the 1970s/80s for championing democracy. >There's a geopolitical reason why they're doing this.  Not really. Taiwan has for decades had the largest gay parade in Asia and what is essentially the lesbian capital of Asia. A good number of young adult women will experiment with lesbianism and they're highly visible in the capital. Ang Lee, Taiwanese director filmed and directed the Wedding Banquet in the early 90's which is a movie about gay relationships.  Taiwan has had the conversation that America just had last year, since at least the 90's and this is perhaps the third or fourth time that equal marriage was on the table. Most cafes and social places support gay marriage and gay characters are regular on TV and media for a very long time.  This has everything to do with the social climate in Taiwan as Taiwanese are notorious for not caring much about international affairs. Sure, but Taiwan is also legitimately the most gay friendly country in Asia. Speaking as a lesbian who has lived there and several other Asian countries  That may be part of it, but there is a lot of social support for marriage equality within Taiwan, and the current push came [after the suicide of Jacques Picoux](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/28/professors-death-could-see-taiwan-become-first-asian-country-to-allow-same-sex-marriage). > Taipei is slowly being isolated and abandoned by other countries for Beijing.   eh..that already happened in the 70s & 80s  'Taiwan had as many as 30 diplomatic allies in the mid-1990s, but now has formal relations with just 21, mostly smaller and poorer nations in Latin America and the Pacific.'  http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/taiwan-folds-away-the-flags-as-china-woos-its-allies/3389940.html  Fuck you Sao Tome, we didn't like you anyways! Well, the US is legally bound to aid Taiwan, in the event of a military conflict with China, but sure, all the extra social pressure would help too. It also has to do with shared values by the global internet generation. >Taipei   The fact you call Taiwan ""Taipei"" already shows you side with Beijing and their ""One-China"" policy. If you really didn't side with them and supported Taiwan, you would actually call it Taiwan. South Korea will probably be the fourth thanks to its heavy evangelical base. I think Singapore and Japan will probably legalize same sex marriage before South Korea.  It has been but in South Korea you can still be fired for being gay. That is illegal in Taiwan. Thailand is dominantly Buddhist and I think this leads to a relaxed view on homosexuality. They have TV series about young gay love that I think are pretty popular across the nation, at least popular enough to keep popping up.  Philippines on the other hand, is dominantly Catholic. Although, most of the people there are fine with LGBT people, I'm not certain of the passing of any type of civil unions in my home country. The law in Thailand allow something similar to marriage. It's something like life partner arrangement. It is almost identical to a marriage. I do not know enough to expand on this. Well, he is personally motivated. http://imgur.com/a/U8VdV Jeremy Lin is an evangelical and almost certainly hates gay people. I think other western countries haven't.  But Australia is in the east... We were one of the first countries to give women the vote - so why not be one of the last to allow same sex marriage? :( not every country has white people too! its like when a blonde person goes there they will be either scared, or like.. treat you like you're the coolest thing on the planet. That's very true and it's something I've had to become aware of as I've travelled to various locations. I think it was just more of a surprise after visiting other Asian countries which were more welcoming, and it's even more noticeable when you see how tolerant of same sex relationships they are.    To be fair, the black people in the US are very different culturally from black people anywhere else, so that's not necessarily a figure best used for an example. As a Canadian, who is a mix between black and Caucasian, Egypt is the only place I've been that's felt welcoming, because I look like the people somewhat (my white friends were much more out of place).   However, Germany is the only country I've been to where race wasn't an issue *at all*. Nobody brought it up, nobody stared or was weird, nobody sneered at me or spit on the ground in front of me, or followed me around the convenience store. I've been to like 50 countries. Fuck the world (except Germany). > Every country has gay people  Not Iran. Ahmedinejad told me so. Chinese culture is generally apathetic about a lot of things that the West has traditionally made a fuss about, like religion and sexuality. Ironically many Westerners saw this as China being stagnant since it didn't have ""religious and sexual revolutions"" even though they never had the same problems to begin with. That's not to say homosexuality isn't seen as bad, but it was never stigmatized to the same extent as in the West due to Christianity. Gays were never stoned to death or some bullshit because they weren't part of God's plan.   China also copied a lot of other ""non-liberal"" aspects from Western culture, like wives taking their husbands' last names. Traditionally only the children took their father's last name, not their mom.  > ""I don't care if people are gay, as long as my children aren't.""  Holyshit that is the must succinct and accurate depiction of a Taiwan in regards to homosexuals. That's exactly how it is. You rarely hear of people whispering , scoffing, or being offended in general when seeing a gay couple, but once it's their kid and they won't have grandkids it's a terrible calamity. Again, even then the calamity isn't about homosexuality, but the fact their *their kid* is. > A literary fancy way of describing homosexual love is called "" love of the torn sleeve"" (), which comes from a story where a gay lover of an emperor had fallen asleep on his sleeve (ancient Chinese clothing had long and airy sleeves), and the emperor, despite his station, cut off his sleeve rather than waking his lover up.  I read some Islamic story about a guy with a cat who did the same thing. I wonder where such a fable originated from as a sign of affections, I'm gonna blame the Mongols. the strongest opposition in taiwan is coming from christian groups who don't like anything that isn't them.  if it make you feel better, they won't even hire ABCs who speaks perfect English and at lot of times, Chinese as well.  They hire white people for the looks only.   Your description of 'wanting the best for your kids' gave me a perspective that was never described this well before. I'm Chinese and now that I think about my parents and their friends talking, they do view children more as an investment to take care of them when they're old. I'm glad you're not having a bad time i  Taiwan and it could be just my perspective.  I just didn't like people stopping in the street to point and laugh at me, I actually have a few pictures of people trying to sneak pics of me when they thought I wasn't looking.   I don't mind being looked at  The only Taiwanese I know who is racist against black people is a woman who went to live in new Jersey for 20 years.  Also I heard some guy came here and punched a Taiwanese guy when he said """" which is pronounced like nei-geh. It sounds kind of like the n word, but not really.  Most Taiwanese would be interested in your background and whatnot, right? guess whose also discriminated against when it comes to teaching English?  fucking ASIAN Americans  http://business.time.com/2007/10/29/wanted_english_teachers_asians/  but yes, i love hearing white expats complain about how horrible life is for them there.  y..you mean I'm not at the top of the totem pole anymore? my god the horrible racist people here! omfg go to Din Tai Fung for me...  I miss Taipei so much.... Really want to live there for a bit.  it's a Hollywood thing I think. black people in the US seemed to believe Asians hate them too due to bullshit from Hollywood. I went to China with a friend of mine. He's 6'5"" and black. A lot of people went to take pictures with him Taiwan get A LOT of stereotypes from the US. The good ones and the bad ones. > A lot of Asian countries do. I think it has to do with the fact that they are all very homogenous societies and many go their entire lives never seeing a black person in real life. It's less about hate, much more about ignorance.   I'm black and lived all over asia.....it was not a problem at all. White people around sure liked to believe it was and missed all the negative stuff asians told me about them.   Very true. You hear stories about foreigners visiting, and the locals want to take pictures with them and everything out of amazement. A lot of them probably do grow up without ever seeing people other than their own race (I'm thinking rural areas in Asian countries, especially) I'm black and lived in asia.....most of the horror stories are from white people who overhear something really blatant in their ESL class or think the racist shop owner in the hood learned it from back home(he didn't).   Overwhelmingly, asians are just classicist first.....if your assumed to be from a poorer or less country(anywhere in africa, eastern europe) then your gonna get some cold look or attitudes. For example, if your friend is assumed to be black american and white guy russian.....the russian looking dude will be treated way worse or harassed by local police.    Almost as if they're trying to shift blame off of their own countries.   'You talk about racism and discrimination here but look at Taiwan!  They're even more racist!' The claims that Eastern countries are more racist are substantiated by surveys. They're not baseless claims Not to discount what you're saying but celebs tend to get seen in a different light. I'm guessing if I was famous I would have received different treatment.   But my time in Taiwan although negative at first did teach me to have more perspective. The first few days were harsh and all I noticed were stares, snickering, pointing and laughing. By day 3 i got over myself, stopped being so on guard  and realised their were also quite a few genuine welcoming smiles too.  RuPaul and Jujubee seem to get along just fine henny. That's a cancel out combo Younger Taiwanese don't care - they're for gay marriage and craft beers.  Hoping Taiwan retracts their claim to all of China and pushes for the independent nation thing. Then again I also want to watch the world burn...   >The only reason we refer to ""Republic of China"" as Taiwan is to not upset ""People's Republic of China"" and because having two Chinas is confusing.   The people of Taiwan refers to their country as Taiwan. The people of China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and all the other neighboring countries refer to that island country as Taiwan and the people as Taiwanese. Ain't no people actually calling themselves the Republic of China except to be politically pedantic.   Nah, the Communist Gov. has more claim to mainland China. Not sure howread you are on history, but the Nationalist Government was pretty apaling during the civil war as well. But hey, different people recognise different countries, but it's pretty clear Taiwan has little interest in trying to retake the mainland. I dream of being an expat in Taiwan, such a wonderful place. ""Fake it till we make it"" is like the definition of the Taiwanese Dream, if such a thing exists. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] Yeah, its mostly because the people against gay rights are just too lazy or don't care about implementing laws against it over here. But still, its pretty neat. My hero. You keep that up and turn some new ones, too. Maybe some day I can sleep with a chick for free. Really? I suck dick because I love it. I volunteer for the planet  I'm reminded of [this guy](http://imgur.com/gallery/UoseMvp) who suggests another reason. Saving the planet one facial at a time https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFz3Oq5eJvY Well it's kinda both - they'd like to have fewer people but to have a meaningful reduction in population solely from decreased fertility rates would be economically painful for generations.  ""Ideally"" there would be a disease that killed a significant number of the elderly (sufficient to remove the socioeconomic burden from the younger generations), and then once an environmentally sustainable population number was reached the government could provide incentives and such to keep fertility at replacement level.     Taiwan is just as severe as Japan and likely to be worse before this decade is over. Most people just don't realize many countries are facing the same aging problems as Japan  Taiwan fertility rate: 1.12  Japan fertility rate 1.41 Actually, Taiwan has a worse overpopulation problem than Japan AND has lower fertility rates.  If it weren't for redistricting and combining many cities and rural areas into one large one, Taiwan would still have some of the most population dense areas in the world. Time crystals  He spreading up alternate facts from some alternate universe. It is pretty clear from his language that he's partisan and hoping that people will go with his completely twisted version.  For example, the president has a 46% approval rating, but that's normal in Taiwan. The last president had as low as a 9% approval rating and hovered around 20% for some context. The plan is to have a 40 hour work week because overtime is rampantly being abused in Taiwan. Overtime will also become about 2.5x normal pay.  Gay marriage is slow on coming actually, and this is because a lot of local legislators stand to lose some votes by voting for that rather than doing nothing. Doing nothing is safe and so they now have a lot of negotiating power for their counties. That's the hold up as incentives are discussed in the background. Meanwhile instead of being a distraction as that guy wrote, for the first time ever, the three major parties in Taiwan have all submitted a gay marriage bill that have all passed first reading. It's a 5 day work week. See /u/TheLoveCraftPorn's comment. >pull of a 12 day work week  easy, she made one week=12 days  Its China...erm well...Almost China. They can do things like that.  it bothers me how similar that is to republicans and democrats. china probably fears the 2 party system because 1 party might be willing to wreck the entire country to get a majority in government seats.  Here are some creditable source [http://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/taiwan-maximum-40-hour-work-week-in-effect/] and  [http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2015/05/16/436156/Two-days.htm] In short, that guy omitted some of the most important part about the new labor changes. -Reducing Work week to 40 hr (from 46 hrs) per week. -Banning working for 7 days in the row. -Guaranteed two day weekend (used to be suggested  -Required the documentation of work hours and employer has to present the documentation when requested.   It mostly benefit the workers, even with the one more work week. ""Corporate Agenda"" LOL. the guy is arguing over something irrelevant to the article.  as far as I know, majority of full-timers do get weekends off already. there are outliers but they aren't the majority. But literally everyone here believes in ghosts.  And the rest is ""other"". Glad I could help. A lot of people don't realise that Jiang Jie Shi and his son, held the title of longest period of martial law within a country for 38 years, until Syria broke that record. The nickname of his reign in Taiwan was known as the ""white terror.""   And then there's the whole (and it's an issue today) repression of the natives of the island.    Don't forget that the Chinese Civil War didn't end neatly - to the KMT and those that fled to Taiwan, it was merely on hiatus until the Communists wanted to invade. Obviously it never happened, but the spectre of war hung heavy. It's anachronistic to see the KMT as a military government in peacetime, rather than a military government in between wars. The 'White Terror' has been over for 30 years, and the KMT peacefully transitioned to a democracy once the old guard had moved on. Modern day Taiwan is no more 'fascist' than modern day Germany is Nazi. The KMT isn't currently in power, though they are the traditionally dominant party.  yeah, the KMT were literally allied with Nazi Germany until they dumped them for the Japanese  You called it. It's scary how some people aren't aware that their perspective is propaganda influenced too  Taiwan's life quality increased due to increasing trade with the mainland.  That trade deal depended on the '92 consensus that both the Mainland and Taiwan are in One China together which was the deal by Taiwanese themselves.  So if Taiwanese people no longer feel the need of the '92 consensus, then their privilege will be taken away.  > Painting with a broad brush there eh? Trump's recognition of Taiwan is one of the few things I have commended him for.   Trump doesn't care about Taiwan, he just wants to fuck with China. Escalation of conflict probably makes Taiwan's situation more precarious, if anything. I'm not an expert on this stuff though.  FYI, he's a /r/the_donald shitposter. I feel like a lot of liberals have polarized to the other side just because they don't want to admit they agree with Trump on something. Pragmatism is not a word I see on Reddit enough. Is it really pragmatic, though, to wait around and diddle our thumbs waiting for an increasingly bold China to become strong enough to make good on their threats and start bullying us?  Now, I'm not advocating war, necessarily, but I really hate it when the condescending pricks (not you of course) act like taking a harder line on China is short-sighted and dumb when there is a very real possibility it may be the opposite. For real, congrats people of Taiwan!  Yeah, Taiwanese people are genuinely pretty liberal. They're not just aping the USA. They have single payer universal health care as well. More open to immigration than most of their peers in north east Asia. Etc. And the other half were thrilled. We support Taiwan diplomatically and militarily if needed. However, there's an understanding that in public we are supposed to keep up appearances of ""One China"", even if in private we're secretly rooting for Taiwan.  Tl;dr: Geopolitics is weird. Got ripped to shreds for acknowledging the existence of a country that damn well deserves the acknowledgment. Seriously, fuck China. Because he showed his complete lack of experience and refused to admit he made a mistake. If he did so as part of a plan to distance himself from China and ally the US with Taiwan, people wouldn't have cared beyond ""Maybe we should ally with the stronger china"". But instead Trump just up and calls Taiwan without understanding the complexities of chinese relations in the geopolitical world. Then he lied about scheduling the call with Taiwan. Then he tried to say ""look at Obama, he did same thing"" when Obama did not, in fact, do same thing.   That's why he got shit on. I'll still trying to figure out why people on the left are suddenly abandoning Taiwan just cause Trump is supporting them... it makes no sense. Taiwan desperately needs western support.  Pretty much. If I remember correctly, the news came the day after he won the general election, so those on the left were immediately claiming he was agitating China and already stoking the coals of WW3. To shreds you say? Yeah the Commy left loves China and their sterling human rights record.  When did Trump lose popular support for communicating with Taiwan? Most people don't know the gravity of the situation and the other half are thrilled because they DO. It's only the media and political establishment that wasn't the status quo to never change and have no political or moral backbone.  Are Americans for one China policy or something? Why would they be mad at Trump talking to the Taiwanese?  To be fair, I think that most Democrats who opposed him taking the call from Taiwan only did so because they feel the need to oppose everything that Trump does. It's really pretty insane to watch them take on positions that would normally be considered against liberal principles because they just can't fucking stand agreeing with Trump on *anything*.   I am nearly 100% sure that if it were Obama who had talked to the Taiwanese president, Democrats would be applauding him for developing our relationship with one of the countries with the most potential for implementing progressive and Western values in East Asia.  Not to say that Republicans are any better though (e.g. on universal healthcare  all the Republicans who totally opposed the ACA and made no effort to reform it, only trying to repeal it, DESPITE it originally being a conservative idea that was first put into place by Mitt Romney of all people in Massachusetts). I'm also sure that if it *had* been Obama who took the call, Republicans would also be totally opposed to it.   It's just sad that our political climate is so polarized today that many people can't even judge policies and political actions based on their own merit  their evaluation has to rely on **who** proposes or does them. As a Thai, I would disagree. Gays, lesbians and the transgendered have been serving in the military for decades, and Thailand has perhaps the largest infrastructure of glbt nightlife, hospitality and special events and holidays.  ??? Taipei is the capital of Taiwan. He was just using the very common method of referring to the government of a country via the name of the capital city, like you just did with Beijing. >Beijing  The fact you call China ""Beijing"" already shows you side with Beijing and their ""One-China"" policy... Yep. We got a lots more way to go. But I have my hopes.  And i think we are the only country aside from the vatican that doesnt allow divorce. So same sex marriage no. Weed legalization probably no. This is adorable man, I miss him on the rockets In all seriousness, which ones? https://xkcd.com/503/ ""Western"" countries are measured more in cultural terms rather than geographic. Most ""Western"" countries just happen to fall in the Western Hemisphere, with the exception of Australia and New Zealand (and maybe Japan - mainly due to culture).  China for example I went to rural Vietnam with purple hair, I had an entire entourage following me around taking photos of me for two days.  But it's not wrong that white people still get kinda adored by a lot of people there, while blacks usually don't.  Mostly because Asia has a lot of exposure to the ""rich west"" and the way they romanticize European culture is actually really cool. Made it easier to see my own culture when I did it through their eyes, because they just really like that stuff for some reason. So you are saying I should travel more. After WW2, Germany did everything they could to create a tolerant society  That's interesting because I had an Indian co worker who worked out of our European HQ, and our Euro HQ moved from London to Hamburg. He said he felt a lot more welcome by the people in London than he did in Hamburg. But maybe that's just due to the amount of Indians in the UK. Right. I think it's interesting that homosexuality had never been forbidden by law in Republic of China (aka Taiwan), unlike in many other countries.  Since when did Chinese wives take their husbands' last names? I've literally never seen this.  Wouldn't a sperm bank or ""substitute mother"" solve that problem? The Chinese story came way before the Mongols were a regional power. Many people forget that in many Asian countries your children are your retirement plan. Edit: not used to the mobile version.   As I was saying I don't mind being looked at, I'm very much a foreigner and most people have not seen black people.  I went to Taipei for 4 days after having travelled round Japan for 3 weeks, so it was just a big difference.  They're very different cultures so it's to be expected.  I'm a white dude and this happens to me every time I go to Shanghai for work.  Welcome to being a minority.....we're used to it.  Sometimes people will smirk while looking at me , I think because they associate being black with having a big dick. Din Tai Fung is world wide now! They probs thought he plays for the NBA In their defense, 6'5 is quite tall. Yep, second-hand stereotypes in particular kind of get amplified when you don't actually have anyone you can reference.  [yep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darlie) This is possibly the most accurate post here regarding anything. Asians are definitely class-ist first. Taiwanese people think white and blacks are racist towards Asians in Murcia  People would ask me stupid questions about white or black people being racist to Asians, blows my mind how these people get their information about the States, Asian Americans are not  living like the 1900s anymore ffs I had the same problem visiting China the first time in my life. And I'm Chinese. There's dickheads everywhere.  you are overtly sensitive and misunderstood people. Strangers will not do this to you - they are staring because they are curious not because they're discriminated against you.   The Taiwanese Dream is actually owning a small business. A whopping 27% of the population does.

China used to have two parties, then there was civil war. This is what American workers have to look forward to as Trump gets rid of corporate regulations and social safety nets.  We already don't retire. So I guess this is what happened: The workers are pissed about having to work one more week per year. The corporates are pissed about having less overall work hours.  It's a compromise that everyone is pissed off by it, and hence the low approval ratings. Not to mention heavily increasing overtime pay and making it mandatory. That's the thing that has been letting companies abuse it in the past. I would argue that more people believe in ghosts than any single religion has followers or even the top 2.  This guy was trying to slip us a fast one with his missing 2/15ths! Please also don't forget that there's the people of Taiwan that everyone always neglects to talk about. The Chinese Nationalists that immigrated to Taiwan make up only 14% of the population. When they arrived they saw a bunch of people asking for democracy and being too Japanified, so they slaughtered a pile of them. That's not entirely correct. The alliance had started way earlier than the rise of Nazism. It started under Bismarck and was put into high gear under the Weimar Republic. The ""alliance"" with Nazi Germany was a result of having cooperated with Weimar Republic and Hitler allowing the program to run to their completion. Hitler was ambivalent about the cooperation, and finally becoming negative after China signed the Sino-Russian non aggression pact.   See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-German_cooperation_until_1941 That was more of a grandfathered-in alliance that the government had with the previous German administration. They made no new deals after the Nazi party came to rule, though mostly because neither side really cared for the other too much. Taiwan making decisions for Taiwan is perfectly sensible. Even if that decision is integration with China.  An agent other than Taiwan making decisions for Taiwan is imperialism, and is inconsistent with western political ethics. It increased very greatly. [The chart here says a lot.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Asian_Tigers#/media/File:Four_Tigers_GDP_per_capita.svg)   The Taiwanese GDP per capita tripled from 92 to today, in a period of 24 years.  So you think billions of dollars of private industry will just vanish overnight because of a few polls? a few of his advisors care. I try to engage everybody in conversation, I don't care where he spends his time on reddit.  Doesn't always work, but I have gotten some decent discussions from it. I'd say that purely symbolic stuff like official recognition of Taiwan (everyone already unofficially recognizes them, even China) is a specifically bad area to fight over though. It doesn't make any actual difference, but it stirs up tensions. I think that's a significant difference from the SCS situation, where pushback can actually affect China's territorial expansionism. Part of the problem though is that I don't think there's anything approaching a national or international consensus on how far we're willing to push China.  I agree its not necessarily wrong, but given how flippant Trump is with his social media, many are worried that its not part of a strategy and simply a flavor of the month, off-the-cuff decision. Aligning pro-Taiwan is pretty worthless unless the US is willing to strengthen trading ties, instead of cutting them, elsewhere (ahem mexico ahem) and strengthen military ties with Korea/Japan.  It may be a bad idea to antagonize all your major trade partners at once, no matter current trade deficit. > 52%  [removed] > Geopolitics is weird  Indeed, either way I see this as a good move for Taiwan, not only is it helpful for Taiwan's LGBT community, but it'll also make western nations more willing to work with Taiwan. As of now though, Taiwanese people are content with how things are geopolitically as long as it means they don't get absorbed into the mainland or have their ways of life disrupted. Yep. If people support a free Tibet, which most liberals tend to do, then they should definitely support a free Taiwan. I'm chinese, totally agree with u. The whole free tibet thing is unlikely going anywhere apparently, but i actually dont mind taiwan independence and neither do my friends. but its core value for ccp so dont think they ll let it go. But all above aside, screw you for saying fuck china and ur username looking potentially racist to both asian and black, u better be one of em >Maybe we should ally with the stronger china  Yeah lets throw out one of our strongest democratic allies in Asia which happens to have some of the best press and personal freedoms there, to scare the shit out of Japan and South Korea and the rest of SEA, *just to be allies with the authoritarian Chinese which has been very aggressive in the region.*  That's a terrible idea and most in all US think tanks from the entire spectrum would agree.  Taiwan doesn't even claim to be China anymore but people still repeat 25 year old news. Most Taiwanese people don't identify with being Chinese anymore either. Most just want to be left alone.  Even a broken clock is right twice a day. As much as I might disagree with him, Trump is not as stupid as you think.   Receiving Taiwan's call was a calculated move, which was best expressed in his later comment that I fully understand the one China policy, but I dont know why we have to be bound by a one China policy **unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade** ...   Anyone should be able to read from this what Trump is actually after, here. He doesn't care about Taiwan's liberalism - in fact he campaigned against those very liberal values, so why would he support them in public? He doesn't care about Taiwan's democracy or independence. What he cares about is making a better business deal. The ""One China policy"" is being used as a card to pressure China on *trade*.  In fact, one could argue that Trump's policy doesn't differ fundamentally from that of previous presidents, since the US policy towards Taiwan has always been one of opportunism - telling the world the US supports One China, all the while selling weapons to Taiwan. The only difference is that Trump wants an even better deal, where China pays the US to discourage Taiwan from becoming independent.  Officially, the Chinese have said fuck no and that the One China policy is not up for negotiation. But behind closed doors, I'm sure they're already weighing their options and considering Trump's offer, since in this situation, the US actually does hold better cards. This is because Trump has already decided that he's going to trade war China should they not accept his deal, so anything the Chinese can do economically in retaliation for US recognition of Taiwan, Trump has already planned for. It's therefore a win-win for the Trump administration. Either China accepts the deal, in which case the US gets the better of them in trade; or China rejects the deal, in which case the US stops supporting the One China policy, and uses any Chinese economic retaliation as justification for trade war.  Taiwan has long been one of China's most sensitive security weaknesses, much more so than Tibet and Xinjiang where no outside power can have a large influence, since the Chinese exert complete control over those regions & would only laugh at your bluff. So it is to Trump and his team's credit that he's been able to identify this weakness, and to fully exploit it, whereas past administrations have only been able to milk it for weapons exports and limited Chinese support in international negotiations.  In fact, I'd argue the same for Trump and his team's recognition of the strategic importance of dividing Russia from China, though here I think the chances are bigger that it'll back fire, because Putin appears determined to play both sides, and the US may well give up more in one area of the world for gains in another.  Whatever the case, it is dangerous to underestimate Trump and to think that he's a complete idiot, as certain news media have been quick to say. He might be wrong on many issues, and he might be overly influenced by his right wing base, but he's also shown a surprising amount of insight into the nature of the US's rivals, and how best to manipulate them. The fact that the mood in China has turned from one of content amusement at Trump's victory, to one of militaristic caution at his next move, says it all.  He didn't call, Taiwan president Tsai Ing-Wen called him. > It was planned weeks ahead by staffers and Taiwan specialists on both sides, according to people familiar with the plans.  > Immediately after Trump won the Nov. 8 election, his staffers compiled a list of foreign leaders with whom to arrange calls. Very early on, Taiwan was on that list, said Stephen Yates, a national security official during the presidency of George W. Bush and an expert on China and Taiwan. Once the call was scheduled, I was told that there was a briefing for President-elect Trump. They knew that there would be reaction and potential blowback.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-taiwan-phone-call-was-weeks-in-the-planning-say-people-who-were-involved/2016/12/04/f8be4b0c-ba4e-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html?utm_term=.25fbf6b34dde Trump accepted a call from Taiwan. He did not call them.  He didn't call Taiwan. The President of Taiwan called him to congratulate him on winning.  Nobody's obligated to entertain China's delusions. He didn't make a mistake.

There's nothing particularly western about their culture. i figured, but it's funny to point out >> Most ""Western"" countries just happen to fall in the Western Hemisphere, with the exception of Australia and New Zealand   Do you even know what Eastern/Western hemispheres are? Do you have a clue about 0 deg longitude? Most of the western countries are in Eastern hemisphere. So many people wanting to touch your hair or arms and shit... wow really? :o It goes even deeper in India, since historically lighter skin meant a higher social class.  nah just got to a tourism area, eventually asian tour buses will arrive and ask for your photograph  Honestly it can be good or bad. But some countries can go insane with it- ask you for your autograph, take pictures with you, ridiculous stuff. In Hong Kong, ladies usually with high social standings will add their husbands last name in the front of their Chinese names and then they usually take their husband surname for their English names.   Good examples are the two female Hong Kong Chief Executive Officer candidates, Ip Lau Suk-yee (Western name Regina Ip) - Lau is her Maiden name and Ip is/was her husband's surname and Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor (Western name Carrie Lam) with Cheng being her Maiden name and Lam as her husband's surname   They are both terrible candidates but Carrie Lam will probably get the position. I think the general mood is Carrie Lam is endorsed by the Chinese govt.  What?? I'm Chinese and EVERY Chinese family I know have wives that take their husbands' names. A situation in which they don't would be in a professional environment where they would most likely use their own.   Edit: Alright, just to clarify, I'm from Singapore. Sorry for the confusion  The Mongols could have spread it from China to the Middle East. Not anymore. Almost globally kids are worse off than their parents. Thanks central bankers. Ireland has only very recently become a country of immigration. We have a lot of Africans (particularly Nigerians) here now, and not just in cities. But it was not always so.  My parents tell the story of the time a couple of friends (two young black me) visited them from England, and borrowed my parents' tandem and cycled it through town, and then wondered why people were staring at them. But apparently they were also shocked the first time they saw a cow in a field. I'm from an Asian country, and even though people here aren't so rude to take pics of foreigners like that, most of them do tend to look in the general direction. It happens to me too (as in I suddenly notice foreigners too) , mainly because it's just surprising to see a white person when your eyes just aren't expecting it. Most foreigners also tend to be taller and well built. Hope you don't feel too weirded out! Most of them probably mean well I'm a latino, though I was raised for my first 15 years in the USA. I'm always curious of other countries and their culture, specially Taiwan, they seem to be a very cool niche country in Asia.  How would a latino, tan or light brown with black hair, fare in Taiwan, like to teach english or at least visit. No DTF in Canada yet  There are millions of illegal immigrants who are black people in China's Guangzhou province. this is actually why integration is so important cause it's a hell of a lot harder to generalize a people if you know one of them.   Are you serious? China is the one demanding that Taiwan adhere to the ""one China"" policy. If they decided to become fully independent PRC would likely attack and they would only have the US to defend them.   Proc would never accept a declaration of a new country, because they see Taiwan as part of China,  just occupied by rebels.  idk if they'd want to ally with the mainland given how power hungry they are. But who are we kidding any independence talk and China is invading. [removed] To be fair, a lot of other shit has also happened in the last 25 years. China's GDP has WAY more then tripled in that same time.  Depending what the polls entail.  > I think that's a significant difference from the SCS situation  [Take a good hard look at where Taiwan is on the map](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-35592988). The situations are linked thanks to good ol' geopolitics. It was sort of fake news.  Diplomacy is the art of bullshit, and the ""One China"" policy is no exception. We publicly say we respect that Taiwan is beholden to China, and then we also publicly sell Taiwan a bunch of weapons.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_US_arms_sales_to_Taiwan  (seriously, read the link, we've literally sold them an entire military worth of hardware)  So yes, maybe Trump violated this delicate balance with a phone call, but yes, ""One China"" is total bullshit. The ""Fake News"" aspect is that every media outlet blustered about Trump's call, but none of them mentioned the 150 F-16s we've sold Taiwan, or that every president since Jimmy Carter has engaged in such sales. If anything I thought Thailand will inherit the mantle of first Asian country for gay marriage. Tibet is already occupied/part of China. It's not going to change. Taiwan is not occupied, and is effectively independent. Official recognition by the US could spur China to invade Taiwan, or launch some form of attack. They are extremely different scenarios.  Also, people who support independence for Tibet don't realize that Tibet is a harsh, mountainous, landlocked region that would probably be dirt poor without a lifeline - China funnels a lot of money into infrastructure developments in regions like Tibet. Yes, to solidify control, but also at least they have roads and access to a larger economy with avenues for trade.  Conceptually, every region that wants to be free, should be independent. Tibet, Taiwan, Chechnya, Texas, California, whatever. But your average person who wants those things has no training in economics, politics, international trade, major business connections, etc. Or anything, really, that would give them any reasonable perspective into the ramifications of such an event. To come full circle, this is why governing through populism is so dangerous. It's easy to spread an ideology, and it's not terribly hard to feed that ideology with policies, but it's really damn hard to run a country properly, and ""common sense solutions"" are usually completely nuance-free and fail to account for the massive chains of cause and effect that ripple through every major policy change. It's really easy to mess something up, it's really hard to get an incremental positive change. > Even a broken clock is right twice a day.  That's deep.   And yea, speaking as a Taiwanese person, it sure sounds good to be fully sovereign and recognized diplomatically on the int'l arena, but realistically, we stand to lose A LOT more by realizing that agenda. There's a lot of nationalist sentiment being pushed around by the current TW administration, but as with almost all nationalist sentiments around the world today, following up on that political idealism would be disastrous for the everyday-person.   When Trump pulls us out as a bargaining chip on the table, we're clenching hard because things can go south really quickly even if we don't do anything. If Trump makes a power move against China, it'd be a huge loss of face -- and maybe even political suicide -- for a TW politician to say, ""Oh China, don't listen to Trump, we're not sovereign ^don't ^invade ^us ^or ^rip ^our ^economy ^to ^shreds."" But we also wouldn't be able to say, ""Yeah, China, we should be sovereign -- listen to Trump! ^don't ^invade ^us ^or ^rip ^our ^economy ^to ^shreds ^pls."" The status quo ain't terrible, all things considered, so don't involve us in your politics. Angering China would ruin things, and China has massive influence in our economics, whether we like it or not.   Also, I don't claim to be an expert on cross-straight relations, so take all my comments with a huge grain of salt. They're just my naive perspectives. There's a lot of kneejerk sentiment that whatever Trump does is bad. He does a lot of bad things, but he isn't the epitome of evil Taiwan still does officially claim to be the Republic of China and still claim mainland China.  It was mainland nationalists, who came to say there is one china and they would take the mainland back. Status quo is both taiwan and beijing claims to be legit government of entire china. Taiwan has neither power nor will to take mainland. ""Taiwan independence"" is an oxymoron. It is an independent state only lacking diplomatic recognition, because of chinese bullying.  It would certainly be nice if everything were this simple. Unfortunately, geopolitics is complicated. This comment is a good example of the phrase, ""You don't know what you don't know."" Except there's no incentive for China to play his game. If he wants to officially recognize Taiwan, then it puts Taiwan in a situation where they either open up the threat of invasion from China (which they'd almost certainly lose, or at least end up with severe infrastructure damage) or they'd have to say, ""No, no, we're still One China,"" in which case it weakens both Taiwan's position in the future as well as whatever Trump was banking on using them as a bargaining chip for.  Using Taiwan is a bargaining chip for a trade deal is reckless. Extremely so. Not the least of which reasons being that Taiwan probably isn't even on his side in this type of game. Plus it risks a fairly significant war and any semblance of autonomy Taiwan has, at the moment.  I'm not going to call Trump stupid, I really have no idea. But there's clearly a lot more at stake than trade here, and Taiwan isn't the right bargaining chip, anyhow. Does it really matter who called who? Its not like the Taiwan president has Trump on her phone number list. Scheduled beforehand by both parties. He scheduled the call. Because when someone tells you that they are an idiot, you should believe them.  Why are you assuming that he did understand the Chinese/Taiwan relationship before the call? Or are you just making that up? Does he strike you as the sort of person who does? Dont forget  ""WTF I love the TPP now!""   after Trump struck it down. Don't forget ""WTF I love the TPP now!"" Pretty sure the left already loved globalism, but other things are fun to watch people flip flop on.  Especially ""there's no evidence of fraudulent voting"" to debunk Trump's 3m illegal votes claim (which is bullshit in the first place) followed by claims that Russia *literally* hacked the election, when at best they slightly influenced it by giving the DNC emails to Wikileaks. You can think it's a dumb idea without hating Taiwan or liking China. If you have a friend that punches someone in the face that you don't like, it's still stupid and you can still be his friend. ""The left"" is not some shared consciousness entity. No flip flop from me at least... I've always had a love hate relationship with both China and Taiwan... The hate mostly comes from our jobs moving to those countries...  I've always hated WikiLeaks... Too many things published by WikiLeaks put our troops in danger.  Fuck the Koch brothers  Anyone that hates Elon for him being on an advisory board doesn't see the big picture of what he can do to help keep this country moving forward  Globalism is another love hate for me... See China/Taiwan ""WTF I love strawmen now!"" - the right Also Northern Ireland Germany? Seriously? I always thought it was legal there. >Germany, Liechtenstein, Italy, Austria, Australia, Greece, Switzerland, Chile, Peru, Finland (pending till March), Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia   But, what about Poland?(Since you included countries like Lithuania and other baltic states,Czechia,Hungary,Slovakia)...

I think your source needs fixing, legal in Finland. There's an issue in Russia and the old Soviet states that  people believe being gay equals being a pedophile. There's of course no link between the two, but that's irrelevant.  To my knowledge you won't see the lynching of gays you occasionally see in Russia (where this belief is stronger) in the baltic states, but from having Latvians in the family and having spent some time there I can say the sentimentis still going strong. It doesn't sit very well with the Russian macho culture either that you have in these countries. Chile, Peru are not western like ... I feel an Animaniacs song in there somewhere. Germany surprises me. Subtext explains /r/MapsWithoutNZ  There seems to be this pervasive belief on reddit (and maybe the US generally, I'm not sure) that Japanese culture was completely transformed and Americanised during the brief post-WW2 occupation.  I've seen several people argue that, it's really bizarre. Undeniably there's a noticeable American influence (baseball being probably the most obvious thing), but it's absolutely dwarfed by the huge cultural differences. Japan is arguably more like the UK than it is the US, though that's neither here nor there. Japan and South Korea are sometimes lumped together because they have Western style governments (democracies), are aligned with the West geopolitically (United States), and are highly developed.  You can't really argue that they are culturally Western though. For example, even though there are a fair amount of Christians, the culture does not have Christianity as a basis like other Western nations.  They do love their baseball and random English words though. They did colonialism with modern weapons before the end of the colonial era.  I used this as an icebreaker in China with my good friend's friends. It worked pretty well, actually.  Nah he was jk this may be a throwback to a lot of British traditions that are adopted into Hong Kong culture.   Like how the court system used to wear powdered wigs.  Are you talking about English names or actual Chinese names? I know many Chinese wives who took their husband's last name out of conformity in the US, but none of them actually changed their Chinese last name.  Which part of China does your family live in? The Chinese wives I know are from mainland China, were born between 1960-1980, and did not take their husbands' last names. Singapore and HK were British colonies and adopted a lot of British cultural traditions. Oh no, didn't really bother me! Just wanted to explain it's probably not because the above poster was black but rather just a different race in general.   When I went to the more touristy areas, I'm sure there was a lot of people from rural towns who have never seen a white person so I completely understood and took pictures with those who asked.  Not hating on any country but sometimes I take the wide array of culture and ethnicities in my country for granted. I forget many countries to not have that same experience.  I'm quite light brown and I don't really feel that many people looking at me. A lady (in her fifties ) told me I was handsome and smacked my ass it was hilarious.  Anyway you should visit Taiwan and do your research also come on /r/Taiwan lots of information there some trolling also  and shit posting from our friends in /r/CCJ2 also but not much.   Among people under 35 or in big cities? You'd pick up a girlfriend in minutes and have friends quickly. They should build a wall. [removed] I think the problem many observers have, here in Asia, myself included, is that we don't see Trump's calls and proclamations regarding Taiwan, and other Asian issues, as part of a deeper strategy, rather just ignorant, egostistical rambling and blundering, which can have very serious consequences. Agreed, it was an exaggerated crisis. That being said the apprentice better tone it down before he gets us into World War 3.  In spite of appearances, Thailand is a deeply conservative country. We've always been a bargaining chip since the Nixon era. Kissinger pretty much said so himself in the 70's.  The idea is to start from a stronger point of negotiation rather than a weak one.  TW nationalism isn't something the current administration has, being less Chinese is something the entire island has felt for a long time, decades ago. People who still hold onto the dumb idea that Taiwan must be a part of China or must consider themselves Chinese first are an outmoded idea. **You might as well tell Americans to not consider themselves Americans but European first.**  This new ""TW Nationalism"" crap is just being waved around by by very vocal Chinese Nationalists in Taiwan hoping to dent it. But among people under 25, less than 1% feel they are still Chinese. Nope, Bannon is. The guy pulling the strings and slowly beginning a coup. The guy who owned the organization that calls you to reddit to shit on liberals. My girlfriend is Taiwanese. She would probably kill whoever said this lol  China is only obligated to invade Taiwan in the event that Taiwan itself declares independence. Taiwan can thank the US for their support, while saying that they will maintain the status quo so as to prevent an outbreak of violence in East Asia. In such an event, the US and Taiwan both come out smelling like roses, while China alone has to suffer the economic and reputation consequences of threatening the US over its recognition of Taiwan.  Besides, the US can always call China's bluff and have Taiwan declare independence. The US is still much stronger than China militarily, and though I don't think Trump is much of a military man, he likely has it right that the US can take this risk, though I don't believe he wants it to end in an actual war, since that'd allow the US's rivals elsewhere to take advantage.  But either way, the US will gain the initiative and the benefit of choice, while China will have to react. That's always an advantage. I'm just curious, but when did he say that? Are you saying that through his behavior he is an idiot, or did he explicitly say that? Yes because his senior advisory staff at the time have had 30+ years experience on the Taiwan-China issue and they arranged the call. Look, a broken clock is right twice a day.  Trump was right on picking up the call from Democratic Taiwan AND throwing out the TPP. He's wrong on basically everything else. I would argue that you're suppose to assume the best out of the president before you assume the worst. That's an unpopular opinion but it's what America should do until proven otherwise.  So it all boils down to feelings now? The wikileaks thing is definitely hypocritical. I haven't honestly heard much about the Koch brothers/Musk recently, though again it's hypocritical if there's a public opinion flipflop on them. I just haven't seen it thus far.  The votes thing, though, I think is a bit more nuanced. It's entirely possible to argue that there were no falsified ballots as Trump claims, while still maintaining that those who cast *legitimate* votes were unduly influenced by foreign factors. I love the ""hacked the election meme"" when in all actuality a literal 12 year old could pull off that level of email phishing. There is a difference between voter fraud and election fraud. One refers to the idea that individuals are showing up on election day and casting ballots that they aren't supposed to. Other refers to the broad notion of illegitimate interference with an election -- in this case, a foreign state using a variety of means to influence the election in their favour. It is not flip flopping to say that one likely occurred while there is no evidence for the other.   Christ, Americans need civic education.   it's more like ""talking to a former classmate who is now stuck in an abusive relationship""  nobody ""punched"" china Taiwan doesn't do manufacturing like you're thinking anymore. It's not the 80s. Republic has though, woo! That day made me happy to be Irish That's the DUP for you. You Americans think your Republican party is bad? Hoo boy. There's popular support behind it in Germany, but their ruling party of the last decade or so is the Christian Democratic Union. Not religious extremists by any stretch, but conservative enough that they're not going to introduce gay marriage despite public backing for it. Germany, Austria and a couple others have civil unions instead. You can't really lump all these countries together like this. I too am shocked by that one.   In the park next to the holocaust memorial is what I am told is 24/7 video of two gay men kissing. I thought they would have allowed gay marriage by now. Nope, conservatives always blocked legislation. In Poland there are neither same sex marriage nor civil partnership, and considering present government and rage mode against leftists' ideas we have a lot of work to get any rights :P  Death penalty... yikes... great map though! Gives an accurate perspective. Get off Australia's butt... some countries kill because of it!  Thanks for posting! Look at all that death penalty and imprisonement in the middle East! Such nice people. /s Isn't that a map for intercourse not marriage?  yo, Guyana! Suriname! WTF!  way to bring the curve down, dudes! They probably have a civil partnership option.  they have civil partnerships which are equivalent to marriage except for adoption.  Adoption isn't that easy to pass because people start to think about what it would be like to grow up in a family like that and they get cold feet, plus there is a fair amount of christians.   In the US and south africa it was the judges who decided for everybody so it was easier to pass it in full. In South Africa 70% think homosexuality is wrong period, let alone gay marriage. In continental Europe it has to be a widely shared belief before a change like that happens. > For example, even though there are a fair amount of Christians, the culture does not have Christianity as a basis like other Western nations.  Plenty of western countries don't have Christianity as a basis. Both Japanese and Korean cultures are thoroughly Confucian, which is the most obvious thing making them non-western. ""Hi, excuse me, would you like to touch my hair, or arms and shit?"" traditionally Chinese wife take their husband's last name... source: I am Chinese Taiwan wives do not take their husbands' last names, either. In many ways, Taiwan, China, and other Asian countries are ahead of Western countries in terms of progressiveness and equality. Asia is known to be conservative, but that's a stereotype - it's wrong and misleading.  Sounds pretty awesome. I appreciate the response, I will definitely put some time on researching Taiwan and visit it soon then.  Also I do know 50 Cents trolls employed by ccp are lurking always and are very annoying, not sure if ccj are the same people though. Woah man not cool. You are attacking him for saying that Trump is sometimes right after saying he does a lot of bad things. That seems like a real dick move. I would hope that you can think about what you are implying with your post that anyone who doesn't see nothing but bad is obviously not using their own mind to think and is just getting paid.  I mean, is that a risk you want to take? It's the threat that's been hanging over the Taiwan Straight for decades. Is it really worth testing it?  Besides, it doesn't even really need a war. Taiwan's economy is so tied to China now, that China could cripple them economically without much effort.  The other issue is that China doesn't have to worry about its population supporting it. There are no elections to worry about. There's plenty of nationalism to go around. There is an excess of young men who have low prospects for marriage. The country is a manufacturing powerhouse, and loss in trade could be diverted to weapons. Sure, it doesn't want war, a proxy war, a trade war, or economic sanctions, but if there were ever a country that had the set-up for it, it would be modern China. Except that would effectively be a rebuke to the US administration. US: ""We recognize Taiwan's independence."" Taiwan: ""We don't. Thanks, but no thanks."" I'm obviously dramatizing, but the effect is essentially Taiwan saying they disagree with the US on their own independence. It's really hard to take someone seriously when they advocate independence for somewhere that doesn't want it.  US military power, especially naval power, is much stronger than China. But the strategic implications of maintaining a defense of a region directly off China's coast shouldn't be overlooked. Essentially, proximity allows China to rely on both its land forces and its navy, while the US can only use its navy. As you said, it would also take the ability to project military power away from other regions: Iraq, Iran, Ukraine, etc. No one's going nuclear over this, so a nuclear advantage doesn't matter.  Anyhow, before this gets into too much of a game of Axis & Allies here, the point is that Trump, like you said, probably doesn't want to end up in a war with China. For one, he campaigned against Hillary as a war-hawk, and, two, he also advocated for reducing military support for countries overseas and focusing on domestic issues.  Even if you support Trump, would you *really* support him if he got us into a war with China all because he wanted to use Taiwan as a bargaining chip? I mean, even if you're a devout Trump supporter, is that really something you could support?  Edit: Last paragraph wasn't meant to be directed at *you,* HigherMeta, or to make an assumption about your vote or political support. Just a general ""you"" (in this case representing a hypothetical Trump supporter). Wanted to clarify.

The problem is, that a big part of those who don't support same sex marriage + adoption vote CSU/CDU and those who do don't care that much about the topic.

And that, ladies and gentleman, is why we WAIT to release names. There's a lot of confusion in the wake of events like these, and misconceptions have led to awful brigades against the wrong people online in the past. Remember reddits hunt for the boston bombers?  According to the people interviewed in lapresse (who is a french-canadian media), the killer Alexandre Bissonnette was known by community-based organizations for being a troll and harrasing them, targeting immigration issue and mostly feminist groups (that he called feminazi) Link (in french sorry) http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/201701/30/01-5064465-le-suspect-connu-pour-ses-critiques-sur-facebook.php It's a travesty that the name of the witness was leaked. No doubt people will still link him to this incident in order to pass it off as another act of radical Islamic terrorism. Not sure where to post this but [this is hilarious](http://imgur.com/a/F0k55). Fox edited their Facebook post about the event and made a bunch of people look like idiots in the process  EDIT: Forgot a word The witness should lawyer up and sue the shit out of all these media outlets. Poor guy, some outlets even have images of him up.  Here's some information from La Presse about the shooter:  He was an online troll harassing a Welcome Refugees group and feminists on Facebook. He was bullied in high school, did not have friends. Students remember him as quiet and/or arrogant in high school.  More from Global: In a post on Facebook, Bienvenu aux rfugis said they learned with sadness and anger about the identity of the terrorist Alexandre Bissonnette, unfortunately known by several militants in Quebec City for his viewpoints that were pro-LePen and anti-feminist, as expressed in social media and at Universit Laval. This is fucking horrible.. I'm 15 and I live 1 km away from the shooting and I learned today that one of my friend's dad died in the shooting. I seriously don't know what to say. Our entire school was in shock today. People in my school knew the victims, but they also knew the shooter. It was a hard day, may the victims rest in peace. It was completely irresponsible to leak the other guys name. Just completely irresponsible. I wonder how the right wing media that has been completely focused on Mohammed will respond. They will probably say nothing.   As a Canadian, I truly believe we are stronger together and we shouldn't succumb to hate and bigotry. Do not let this divide us. I wish the muslim community in Quebec well. And it's so unfortunate how media outlets were trying to blame muslims for the attack when they were the victims.  I think the /r/Canada rules could be used elsewhere, people shouldn't be rushing to find out who did it rather then spending the time reflecting on what happened.  The only people who truly matter in these situations are the victims, the legal system will sort out the rest.  > All, for transparency sake the earlier post which identified two individuals as suspects has been removed. As this new report highlights, new information has clarified that Bissonnette is the only suspect and the other individual was a witness.  >  This underlines the importance of not prematurely distributing personal information and giving the authorities the time to do their jobs. As with the other posts on the subreddit, We will not have a witch hunt going on, especially for people who may not have anything to do with this. If the media or law enforcement does release this information, only then will we allow it.  > Personal information, witchhunts, and antagonistic posts will be removed without further warning I'am muslim not living in the west and what make sad besides the innocent lives lost is that this tragedy will be used for months by extremist groups to brainwash more youngsters and teens in their shitty and false cause . Briebart is still reporting it was a Morrocan shooter  Glad that they found the truth. JUSTICE I wonder how this despicable and unstable individual was able to procure the  gun needed to carry out this attack. I'm a Canadian gun owner and think our system works pretty well, but it will be interesting to see whether his gun was legally bought, and whether the red-flags that should have alerted the authorities were ignored by the people that vouched for him during the RPAL process.  Perfect example of why authorities don't want to release this info too quickly. Fucking hell.   All those morons raging in the World News thread... ""If they've not released the names it's because they're Muslim! What are you covering up, eh?!""   Did we learn nothing from the stupid shit after Boston!? http://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2017/01/30/bissonnette-aurait-demande-des-conseils-sur-le-web-avant-lattentat  Bissonnette asked for help on /pol/ before attack.  No matter what Canada, we are stronger together. To throw one thing in the mix, let's not ever let anyone roll back our Charter Rights, for any reason.   The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.  They're posting pictures of him there for god sake, Like, he's been cleared you uneducated fucks.  The_Donald has officially deleted all posts mentioning the attacks having learned he was a white supremest. All of them. Bring this up whenever they bring up safe spaces. it is funny how there is not mention of this attack on fox news frontpage.......  edit: now they have a tiny line about it.  People were placing bets on the attackers ""not being white"" in another thread just after it happened, I don't know how anyone can be so careless about our fellow human beings. I pointed out that it was disrespectful and all I got was downvoted and laughed at. The lack of empathy just astounds me sometimes, I shouldn't be surprised though. All I know is when someone enters a place of worship and guns praying people down:  it is an act of evil.  There is no other word I can find for it.     This doesn't fit ""my narrative"".  That's fine. There are and have been Islamic terrorist attacks, and there are clearly also anti-Muslim hate crime terror attacks as we saw yesterday. Both are equally fucking despicable and inhuman. Right wingers like myself can't allow this anti-Muslim hate to build up or continue, we must strongly condemn any and all forms of hate crime against anyone who happens to follow a religion we might not like or respect.   As a right wing person I stand with the Muslim community and against this hatred, remaining silent in the wake of this turn of events that happened to go ""against our narrative"" makes us as bad as any terrorist sympathizer. Mr khadir got fucked by the media. Sue them  As of right now there is still a cached headline as the top google result that identifies the suspect as moroccan   http://imgur.com/ebSghwy  The article headline has changed but the title now does not identify the nationality of the suspect and there is no retraction or apology for the previous headline. Disgraceful journalism.   This is why people need to give shit time...   r/uncensorednews threw a fit because the world news mods were ""censoring"" the attackers named.... this is why! We don't want witch hunts.  Friend of a friend of mine knew that guy. Apparently he was well in his way to do what he did. He was misogynist and had strict, yet naive open point of view. Sources claim that he was probably looking online at the busiest moments to attack.  As someone who lives about three miles away, this litterally hit close to home, and I'm really saddened by the events. As a personnal view of things, I and some of my friends are worried that there may be revenge because of the attack against Muslim, or that terrorist organizations might take quebec as a target from now on. Having to walk by numerous public centre and having to study in one, I could not wish more that we are wrong. This is why you shouldn't release names of these people until due process is underway, the fucking media nearly RUINED Mr.Mohamed's life because of this. Looks like the_donald removed all posts about the shooting. What a shock! To be honest, you'd have to be a bit of a dense mother fucker if your immediate suspicion (or maybe it was hope?) was that a muslim in Quebec out of all his targets decided to shoot up a fucking mosque. Yeah yeah yeah, I know Shia/Sunni conflict, but um, that doesn't exist in Canada. At all.  You mean it wasn't Syrian refugees? Gee, where did all the t_d fuckwits go that were jizzing all over earlier threads over a muslim perp? The Donald tossed this story down the memory hole after it was revealed Alex B. was the culprit and not a couple of Arabs. Fuckhead cunts. This is a sad day. All those kids on the_donald were already so convinced with their fake news stories. What else is new? Is anyone surprised with that sub anymore? A White Nationalist Trump supporter murdered six people at a Quebec mosque this weekend, and Fox News reported that the shooter was Muslim. And still haven't retracted. Official White House persecution complex Sean Spicer said the attack was ""a reminder"" as to why Trump's ""vigilance"" is important. Muslim people get attacked by a nazi, and they aren't even allowed to be victims for a day before an ugly lie puts the gun in their hands. Quebecer here. I just have to say what I'm feeling: the world is lousy right now. http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/dossiers/attentat-a-quebec/201701/30/01-5064556-mohamed-belkhadir-pour-eux-quelquun-qui-fuit-cest-un-suspect.php?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter  according to this article he was trying to administer first aid and then he saw a gun and ran without realizing it was a cops gun which is why they detained him  I have nowhere to vent this, so i'm gonna take a chance and do it here.    i hate that guy. To my deepest core. We are mostly pacifist here in Qubec. We don't like to make trouble and while there will always be some conflict when you try to mix different culture, most of the time it's not bad.    But that guy. This fuckin asshole. just had to come in and fuck everything up for everyone. He had to bring that stupid hate propaganda and bring in the idea that we might see other like him here, in the fuckin safest city in north america. I hate him with a passion. I wish he'll die a horrible slow death.   i hate that now, cause of him and his stupidity, we are now in the list of people who can possibly go on a fuckin hate rampage and kill innoncents people for no other reason than being a fuckin asshole.    Fuck him for bringing this on us, and his family. Because they gonna have to live with this idea that their son was a total moron and after be the target of several hateful people who gonna think his parents are a good target for venting.   I hate everything about this situation and about him. RIGHT  WING  TERRORISTS  Spicer said today that this is why Trump takes the security measures he does.  What security measure has he ordered that would stop a white 'native to country' citizen from shooting up a mosque? None? None. All those Trumpster fucks invading /r/Canada last night after it came out that one *suspect might* be Muslim should be ashamed. Fuck you you pieces of human garbage. Fuck every last one of you. We need to get this on the front page. There's nothing funny about terrorism. But damn if this isn't the most Canadian thing ever - the suspect turned himself in because he ""felt bad"".   My prayers for all those injured and all the families who lost someone today. Regardless of your faith, an attack on any place of worship is reprehensible. I bet the update won't penetrate the echochamber at /r/the_Donald. Where are the **dishonest** and **vile** bigots spreading disinformation about this terrorist act being Muslim or refugee related?   There's not a shred of dignity in them.   Oh, and T_D deleted all threads related to this incident from their front page (were blaming it on ISIS and Muslims) How about we judge crazy individuals as they are and not try to demonize entire groups, whether they are Muslim, Christian, Athiest, Arab, Conservative, or Liberal? This would be a good time to point out to just wait until the next day to find out who the suspect is instead of dragging some poor bastards name through the mud. I know that people tried doing that in the first thread, but they were sentenced to downvote hell and ridiculed for it. This is social media, not a collective journalism front. Who whoulda thunk that 2 week old refugees couldn't speak with a Quebecois accent, could've sworn a full blown Suni vs Shia war like something out of Iraq was happening in Canada... /s I know like a thousand of these alt righters from reading trade chat in WoW. Not every one of them is violent enough to go commit a mass murder though. I feel like I would know this guy like the back of my hand.  I think this is just more proof that people have been pre-conditioned to assume any violence is rooted in Islamic terror. Which is such bullshit, there is literally over 1.6 *billion* people who are Muslim, and almost all of them live peaceful lives. Yes, the attitudes in many nations that mostly adhere to Islam are extremely hard for people in more secular western nations to accept, but very very few of them are actually terrorists or condone terror. A number I've seen is 106 thousand world wide once you count all the various smaller groups. That's a fair amount of people - but only .006625% of all Muslims, basically a rounding error.  Just watch, in the days to come this guy will be labeled a ""lone gunman"" or some such, not ""right-wing Christian terrorist"", which is his proper classification. This guy is politically right next to that scumbag Trump has as his adviser now. And that's why the authorities usually do not publish the names of suspects in Canada, even if that feeds the trash from r/conspiracy and r/the_donald (which ultimately does not matter).  the one thing I gleaned from the article is that the Vatican still uses telegrams.  WTF still uses telegrams. Even more evidence that you should never jump to conclusions without knowing all of the facts. Horrible that this man now has to deal with unwarranted hate and vitriol on top of being a victim of what had to be a traumatic event. Just a terrible situation all around, but I also don't think we should jump to conclusions about the next suspect either. What do we actually know about him yet? His motives or anything? Hopefully we learn more as the investigation proceeds but let's not do the same thing we begrudge others for doing. Between the FLQ, Lortie, Bain, Zehaf-Bibeau, Couture-Rouleau and now Bissonette,  the province of Quebec is starting to have quite an impressive history of ideologically-motivated violence / terrorism.  This saddens me deeply.   http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4170500/White-student-sole-suspect-Quebec-mosque-massacre.html  > Other students described him to DailyMail.com as a pro-Trump loner but a timid man who didn't seem capable of committing an act of terror.   Drumpfkins were celebrating that two Muslims were arrested, but now that the truth has come out that one of their own perpetrated this xenophobic and hateful attack, they are nowhere to be seen. The stories about this were all scrubbed from /r/The_Drumpf. Sean Spicer used this about two hours ago to justify the ban on Muslims (people from Muslim countries) entering the US:  >Sean Spicer starts off his press briefing by saying Trump has spoken with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau to give his condolences over the shooting at a Quebec mosque where six people were killed.  >Spicer notes that the tragic event is a reminder why the president is taking steps to be proactive rather than reactive when it comes to keeping citizens safe.   [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/jan/30/trump-travel-ban-executive-order-world-protests-live) I'm ashamed at all my fellow Canadians that have continued to use this event to spread hatred and fear towards refugees and immigrants. Lets be clear, Canada has a comprehensive vetting process and if someone wants to become a citizen here they should be allowed to, no matter where they are from in the world or what beliefs they may have. We are not just letting in whoever wants to come here. All this fear-mongering will do is breed hate and hate is where terrorism comes from, which is why terrorists come from all religions/ideologies. Hey r/the_donald   1. Where is your post stating this? Especially since you all made up shit yesterday about it being two Muslim refugees. Own up to your mistake.   2. Go fuck yourselves.  Shooter was a white male Trump supporter. Now of course 'not all Trump supporters' are terrorists, but perhaps they should be banned from Canada unless they undergo 'extreme vetting.' http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-mosque-shooting-five-remain-in-critical-condition-following-attack Man can I just say that the Canadian parliament and prime minister handled this with so much grace while giving this news the importance it deserves.   Bravo to the police as well for the swift chase. It still boggles the mind how this terrorist ended up being radicalised. Have you guys seen his pics? Just an average guy.    wonder how many people are going to claim he's actually a muslim disguising himself under a french name  These days the crazies have keyboards and are far too stupid or hypocritical to notice. There are still people posting on FB that the shooter was Muslim with links to fox news.  the battle to downvote this thread is over, spambots. Go away. alt-right terrorism.  15 years of white alt right terrorists ravaging both Canada and the USA more than any other terrorist group. Sad!  And everyone was jumping at the Muslim guy saying he was proof trump was right, turns out its some alt right douche. Guess we should suspend immigration from Canada  > On a Facebook post, the organization Bienvenue aux refugies said Bissonnette was ""unfortunately known by several activists in Quebec City for his viewpoints that were pro-Le Pen and anti-feminist, as expressed in social media and at Universite Laval.""  http://www.torontosun.com/2017/01/30/quebec-mosque-shooting-suspect-to-appear-in-court-monday  Was also a fan of Trump and the ARLAC movement.  He was related to ARLAC And Trump supporters are downvoting this hard, the_donald doesn't have a peep about it.  You bet if it was a Muslim they would be screaming about it 24/7. Who else remembers TD imbeciles incessantly invoking Coulter's Law yesterday on the livethread Have you guys seen that one of the top tweets on this is claiming that the shooter was two Syrian refugees. Fucking fake news.  It's disgusting.  Wow holy shit, can't believe the conclusions people jumped to all day long. Notice how the police officer with firearm drawn retained discipline. Jesus Christ, that's the nicest fucking person I could possibly have imagined. If someone erroneously identified me as a terrorist because I was trying to save people I would probably have thrown a fit.  Why was he mistaken for a suspect? Because he was Muslim? This is said every single time before and AFTER the event but no one ever listens.  People still upvote garbage news. Last night everyone in the /r/worldnews thread was screaming ""COULTERS LAW"" because it was taking a while for any information to come out.  Fucking morons. No names should be published until someone is convicted, not just charged, imo. For any crime. Seriously, I wonder about the value of a law the prohibits journalists from releasing names of suspects until an official release by the police, or until X number of days (I don't know, like three), whichever comes first.  This would be an abridgment of freedom the press, but we have abridged other forms of speech (hate speech, incitement to riot, yelling 'FIRE', etc).  Not saying this would be perfect, but I think it'd be worth considering. The best part is that in true Canadian spirit...Mohamed apparently apologized for being in the way. This is my Canada haha and it brought a tear to my eye. $10 says he has a reddit account [In English:](http://heavy.com/news/2017/01/alexandre-bissonnette-quebec-city-canada-mosque-shooting-attack-suspect-gunman-shooter-photos-pictures-video-motive/)  > But another former classmate, who studied politics with him, at Universit Laval and has kept in touch with him, said Bissonnette, has right-wing political ideas, pro-Israel, anti-immigration. I had many debates with him about Trump. He was obviously pro-Trump.  > The Welcome to Refugees  Quebec City group posted on Facebook that it was also aware of him prior to the shooting, saying he is unfortunately known to several activists in Quebec City for his pro-Le Pen and anti-feminist identity positions at Universit Laval and on social networks. A French male terrorist attacking feminists in Quebec, hmm this sounds familiar.  An angry white male who hates Muslims and spends his time harassing immigrants and trolling feminist groups.  So what's his reddit account? > feminazi  A term originally coined by Rush Limbaugh, arguably the grandfather of the alt-right.  A troll that hates immigrants and women? Sorry you have to deal with this shit too Canada.   -an American.  What's his reddit name? the_donald is still pretending it's a Muslim, Trump supporters are sick people.  They instantly jumped and assumed it's a Muslim, when Muslims in Canada are incredibly peaceful.  The guy was a Trump supporter on his Facebook, shows you how radicalized and violent the right has become.  We hoenstly are living in a dangerous time, unless we stand up to these people this will get worse and worse. They feel emboldened to attack minorities now. Quebec City police, or whatever police service had them and released the names, needs to be held accountable. (Edit: according to the AP, it was a court clerk. This is an iffy source--I think you could go either way on whether the AP was responsible in using her info. But I still don't think you can blame other media orgs too much for going with AP's info, because that's what the AP is for.) Holding the police/municipal government to account is tough, because the community needs to rely on them for safety and protection, but holy shit, that's incredibly irresponsible.  And I predict the media will be blamed for repeating it, and the_donald people will cite this as another example of ""fake news."" Because, you know, a public servant giving the press misleading info is in the same realm as fiction about Clinton's illuminati pedophile pizza parlor.  I really think media corporations that release false names need to be held accountable. Dude's life could have been put at risk. It isn't so funny when you realize that a well-established political maneuver is to state the lie first, and then retract later, since studies have shown that after a year people only remember the lie and forget the retraction.  EDIT: Some people are arguing that the extreme coverage will make this case exempt, but I think they are missing the point of the misleading headline.  In this case the reader is lead to think ""damn muslims, I knew it"" and it is that emotional memory that will stay with them, even after they are confronted with the truth, that it was a white supremicist.  The emotion was reinforced, and the reader is unlikely to confront their own cognitive dissonance, preferring instead to reassure themselves that a muslim would have, even if they hadn't in this case.  /r/news was a shit show last night. Everyone was convinced Sunnis and Shias were duking it out in Canada.  Either that or complete Francophobes. And in 6 months they'll remember it as some muslim guy in Canada killing a bunch of muslims instead of admitting they're wrong.  ""Jackass's""  Omg this is gold, /r/facepalm maybe. WE MUST IMMEDIATELY DEPORT ALL STUDENTS AT LAVAL UNIVERSITY.  Solid gold. This is absolutely precious. You gotta put that into it's own submission, so it can soar far, far away from the nest! > deport them all now CANADA before there is civil war in your Country  Uh, I know these guys aren't exactly gonna be getting their doctorate degrees in politics anytime soon, but I'm pretty sure allowing refugees isn't gonna start a civil war. That's sorta, y'know, what they are running from. And they say Fox News isn't fair and balanced.  They give you both the facts and alternate facts at the same time. Those screenshots need to be archived and posted in a wall of fame of some sort. Even after the correction, and being called out on their shit, people are still defending their original comments bashing Muslims and praising Heir Trump. It's embarrassing really. This shoulx be its own post. Go get that sweet karma man. According to the french-canadian media lapresse who talk to the wrongfully suspected Mohamed Belkhadir, he was trying to help a victim when he saw someone with a gun and (not knowing that it was a cop), try to escape. I can't believe the media let his name be out there. The guy is really resilient though, and said that he understand and respected the police for arresting him (because he understand that for them it seemed like he was trying to escape).  link:(in french sorry) :http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/dossiers/attentat-a-quebec/201701/30/01-5064556-mohamed-belkhadir-pour-eux-quelquun-qui-fuit-cest-un-suspect.php Would be nice if media would stop posting photos of ""suspects"" before they are even charged, yet alone convicted. That should go for both innocents and guilty in my opinion.  Not to mention, you are just giving another shooter more fame and publicity. [removed] Looks like Reddit did as good a job with this one as they did with the Boston bombing.   Great detective work, kiddos. The ""one suspect is Moroccan"" thing was leaked by a police officer to the media during the night, probably to stir shit. Well, *I* was bullied in high school and didn't turn out to be a piece of shit. > did not have friends   No way! But he sounds like such a laid back and friendly dude. I'm shocked. /s   In all seriousness, I think the vast majority of these alt-righters live incredibly lonely and isolated lives.  I bet he's a big red pill the_donald 4chan guy.  So sorry for you, the victims and your community.  My six year old daughter came home sad today. A father of one of her friends, also uncle to one of her classmates, died yesterday.   She said bad men brought guns to a party yesterday. She barely understands the concept of death and yet we'll all have to live through this... I'm so sorry this happened to you. Sending my thoughts to your community from the North of England. Il y a des ressources un peu partout dans la ville et dans les coles. Va parler  quelqu'un si tu en ressens le besoin. Garde pas cette tristesse et cette frustration  l'intrieur. I'm FURIOUS that the innocent man's name was put out there. If you look up the ACTUAL shooter's name, it's all focused on the innocent man and how this goes to show that ""Trump was right"".  I'm do disgusted and angry for him, his family, his community... It allows racists on the_donald to spread the rumor that it was a Muslim. They're using this to spread Islamophobic hatred, when it was a white right wing Trump supporter who is killing Muslims. The thing that bothers me is how shit families involved must feel.  People they know might have just been shot. They check the news to see who died.  >In todays news we found a Muslim suspect who we're certain shot them. WHEN WILL MUSLIMS STOP SHOOTING PEOPLE?!  Not anything helpful  >Turns out we were wrong, it was some other guy. Um... when will gun violence end? Yeah let's go with that WHEN WILL GUNS STOP SHOOTING PEOPLE?!?  Still don't know who to cry for. I disagree, because the nature of this attack is highly political. As such, without clarifying the *facts* behind who did the attack and what their motives were, there are political groups who will gladly take advantage of the unknowns to create their own 'alternative reality' and (as we have seen) they will use these lies to further their global political agenda. We have seen this more in the past year than ever before, and without clarity of facts and respect for the truth, lies and falsehoods will continue to dominate our discussions and politics. It's sad and unfortunate, but it is the world we currently live in - look no further than this headline, FOX news, and the comments by the Trump administration that claim that this attack serves an a justification for his Muslim-targeting immigration ban. When right-wing nut jobs like France's Marine Le Pen also advocate for such bigoted and hateful bans based on generalizations and fear, it is important that we learn to separate fact from fiction so that the world can see these people of the alt-right for what they truly are. They aren't making the world safer, they're making it more dangerous by propagating lies and sowing the seeds of racial and religious division.  Facts are important - it's important that we clarify the truth about this attack; that it was perpetrated by Alexandre Bissonnette, an alt-right radical extremist and domestic terrorist. That is the single, undeniable truth. That makes us in the West sad as well.  The fact of the matter is it comes down to extremism and fanaticism.  That is the one thing all of these attacks has in common.  It always takes some extreme and/or fanatic belief to do something like this.  Whether it be extremist Islam, Christianity, right-wing ideology, left-wing ideology, etc.  We should ideally be focusing on the constant, which is extremism, not the other variables.  Anyway with that said, it isn't all like this in the west, and I hope you realize that reddit is not a good representation of the population at large.  In fact it's a very bad representation.  Sometimes even I forget that until I start talking to some people in my every day life about this stuff.   Which then they will shoot up a popular night club or some other secular gathering, which will make even more people view Muslims as the enemy and some other wack job will go roque and shoot some more innocent Muslim grandparents while they are just going about their business not harming anyone. It's needed by both sides to stamp out radicalism in their ranks.  The only way to fight brainwashing is education and philosophy. Education not based on religion, but based on ethics and logic, history and society, media and propaganda. I wish your people luck and I hope for a future in which moderates of any, all, and no religion can unite against extremists in all parts of the spectrum... I am a Christian living in the West. Can I send you an [online hug](http://media2.giphy.com/media/apcKda9LY1XZS/giphy.gif) ?  We need to stop hate. It's terrible to think that whenever something like that happens, no matter the details, no matter the actual lives lost, it only takes a few minutes for people to jump on the occasion to further push a hate-filled agenda.  Lauren Southern tweeted that it was 2 Syrian refugees, now she's throwing a hissy fit on Twitter about how she was just repeating something she saw on 4chan lol Let's be honest, does it really matter to them that it wasn't?  I am pretty sure 6 months from now people who got their news from the alt-right tweets are still going to believe it was 2 Syrian refugees *who just got into the country last week!  ZOMG!*. The_Donald tries so hard to downvote this stuff and frame the witness as the attacker. Wow. RAINS FROM AB-AAGH Trumpets are downvoting this so hard. They don't ask you any questions any political affiliations and activism. I was also suffering from depression when I applied for my license (PAL) and I thought that might disqualify me but that was not the case.  Yet the reason why we have this process is that it can be back tracked as a precaution.  If others vouched for him, they will be investigated/questioned.  I fully expect the RCMP to tear through this guys entire life in a few days. Because when someone wants to get ahold of a gun badly enough, they will ALWAYS find a way. Waiting for his reddit username. From your link (translated by Google):    > He followed pages like National Generation, Israeli Defense Forces, or Marine LePen. He also followed pages related to the Parti Qubcois, followed by Donald Trump. It's not the first time these kinds of attacks have been linked to /pol/. They breed crazies who tend to post directly on /pol/ to either brag or announce they're about to shoot people.  As much of a cesspit /b/ is, even they don't attract the kinds of cancer users you'll see at /pol/ and /r9k/. > Sur un forum de discussion  caractre haineux, o lanonymat est requis, un internaute canadien, qui pourrait tre Bissonnette, aurait demand  quel moment les mosques sont le plus achalandes.    > 14h44, dimanche le 29 janvier, linternaute crit : Quel jour les mosques sont le plus actives? Je veux manifester  la mosque principale de ma ville et je veux y aller au bon moment.  On a hate-filled internet forum, where all users are anonymous (/pol/) a Canadian, who could be Bissonnette, asked other users when mosques would be filled with the most people possible.   At 2:44 PM yesterday the user wrote ""On which day are mosques the most active? I'm going to demonstrate at the main one in my city and I want to go at the right time""    Edit: I found the thread http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/109855190  The price for an open society is having to take a risk that some people will abuse their freedom in vile ways. This is what people don't seem to understand about what it means to be tolerant. If we can live in a society where white supremacist groups spew hateful ideologies that occasionally inspire others to violence, we can live in a society where we accept immigrants that occasionally spew hateful ideologies that inspire others to violence. Hopefully people took screen shots and such. They're just following their leader's example of trying to hide the stupid shit they said.  I've been paying attention to them especially, when they first announced the names they immediately started focusing on the Arabic name in their headlines. Now that it is looking more and more like an anti-Islamic terror attack it is a minor link on the page AND they don't even put Bissonnette's name in the link, making it easy to believe that the Muslim is still in custody.  [Here is a picture of their homepage](http://imgur.com/dMdpA4s) at the time that I made this post.  Extremely dishonest and dangerous reporting.    The_Donald just deleted everything about the attack from their frontpage... So much to ""uncensored news"" and ""ISIS was behind it!!!"" Funny how the_donald is silent. They were praying it would be a Muslim. [It's there now](https://i.imgur.com/u3uQYvi.png) You can remove the place of worship and just put anytime someone enters a place full of innocent people and guns them down it is an act of evil.  You are the kind of guy I like to have discussions with. Totally different viewpoints (other side politically), but you seem to be ethically and morally sound, and can seperate your political views from acts of fanatics.  have a great day hey look someone with a brain Fucking pussies gonna be pussies. exactly it was stupid as hell to begin with. People were reaching so hard to blame muslims for this  Looks like we are going to have to ban travel from Canada now. In this day and age you kind of need to put an ""/s"" at the end of your post, if it was sarcastic.  On the other hand, if you were serious, it might be good to qualify your question as such.  These days the crazies have keyboards and are working overtime to degrade our society into a chaotic mess of hatred and ignorance. It's hard to tell the wheat from the chaff. Well, wait for all the ""false flag operation!!!""-threads. Didn't you know that /r/the_donald is home of several extraordinarily talented forensic cyber investigators who use their hacker tools like ""google"" to find connections between Pizza crust, Hillary and Muslims? the shooter was a right-wing nationalist, he followed Trump and the French Front National. First the pizza gate dude, now this.  [removed] I remember when the shooters were two Syrian refugees who entered the country last week. The altright sub was hoping it was a white supremacist so they might be happy if it is true.  They claim it shows they don't have any other choice and shows multiculturalism failed.  This is an EXACT quote of a 39 point upvoted comment from their stickied post  >I want to hope and believe is a white guy removing kebab but Cucknadians don't have that kind of resolve. It was probably a Kebab on Kebab on crime, especially given that they did NOT mention that he is white yet. Reference Coulter's Law Reading all the comments directed at Mohamed Khadir from The_Donald and other alt-right subs is just disgusting. Turning a victim into the suspect without any proof then acting like it's the truth. what the fuck man...  They're *still* convinced of their fantasy-world, over there. Just making things up and deleting the facts as usual. At this moment, they've actually scrubbed most of their site of the entire story -- inconvenient, down the memory hole!   If a reddit user had only browsed The_Donald, and wasn't lucky enough to catch one of the posts about this news story before it was deleted by The_Donald mods, they'd *still* think the attacker was the Muslim guy or would believe one of their new made-up stories about Bissonnette being a left-wing liberal...  Then they escape their subreddit and go around pretending their alternate reality is the real one. I mean aren't Islamists also right ring terrorists though?  Let's not shy away from calling it what it is, we all know how much that irks the Trumpists.  RADICAL  ALT-RIGHT  TERRORISM agreed but islamophobia definitely exists in Canada remember. It's not just a Trump thing.  I missed this, thankfully. What's the logic there, though? Why would a Muslim person kill other Muslims during prayer? That seems so... random. The invasion continues. They are now playing the victim card.  And now theyr'e gonna point to this thread and go ""WAAHHH everyone is so mean"" All those people spamming coulters law were actually getting upvoted, I wonder what those idiots have to say for themselves now.  The Vatican does. It is very important to realize what Quebec's history was. They were French speaking Catholics who became dominated by English speaking Anglicans, Quebecois have always viewed themselves as a minority in Canada. You can go back to the Conscription Crisis and Henri Bourassa to see how Quebec differed from the rest of Canada.  There is also a strong cultural identity to being Quebecois and so that is why you see right wing ideologues trying to preserve said culture.  Canadian ban incoming. Build an ice wall and make Trudeau pay for it How are we to know which are good or bad? One bad skittle!!!  When I went to initial thread about this last night, it was flooded with ""coulter law"".  I had no idea what that was and looked it up.  What a stupid load of shit.  Reddit got flooded with stroomfront/breitbart idiots. I really can believe it. > can't believe the conclusions people jumped to all day long.  I have no problem at all to believe that. Especially in the current climate which some people really don't like Muslims (to put it mildly). It's almost as if this is what they're meant to do. Why not us? I wish we had it here like wth man :( He was helping a friend and saw a man run in the mosque with a gun and thought the shooter came back. It was actually the police, and they arrested him because he ran away. He saw the gun on a cop inside as he was helping someone and in the confusion he thought it was a shooter and ran away. It was due diligence by the police. He was running away, which is inherently suspicious. They arrested him. Talked to him and talked to other people at the mosque. It became quickly clear that he had no guilt whatsoever and they released him and passed on the information to the press so that they in turn could clear his name. The former suspect even said himself in an interview that he understood why to police arrested him and respected it. I also highly respect him for trying to help the victims and of course understand why he ran.   Local press was mostly professional, and while they mentioned his name as a suspect, their tone and vocabulary was measured in a way that did not communicate guilt, and they spent appropriate time clearing his name when the police cleared him.  What the American press or some small independent press outlets did with his name however is another story, but locally his name didn't get dragged into the mud despite the mention of ""suspect"", which is a neutral term that is a normal part of diligent police work.  I'd say he was not ""wrongly"" suspected, but was ""rightly"" cleared. Someone running away from a crime scene has got to make police react, for the sake of investigative diligence.   Media could maybe not have given his name, but gotta understand that Quebec is not the USA, and people don't go batshit crazy over someone being called a suspect and when a name is cleared people most generally stop worrying about the person.  A muslim in a mosque? Inconceivable! l'as-tu lu? Because he ran Pretty sure they were all muslim at the mosque, chief Then garbage news gets clicks and garbage news gets paid so it can produce even more garbage news. Welcome to journalism in the 21st century. I got downvoted for saying context matters when you link videos of people being attacked (in response to someone linking a list of attacked trump supporters. To which I acknowledged it happens and is heinous). I was downvoted.   These fucking retards know no shame or irony. The doublethink is amazing.  Interestingly, the media has been very muted about this. The liberal HuffingtonPost, for example, isn't even featuring the story on their front-page, whereas they could concievably blast the headline ""WHITE TRUMP SUPPORTER SHOOTS UP MOSQUE.""  My guess is they don't want to inflame the situation, as this incident is nothing short of an ideal recruiting tool for radical Muslim terrorists. In other words, they are acting humanely and responsibly. Unlike the fucking morons you mention.   The most upvoted comments were going ""OH SO YOU WANT HIM TO BE WHITE! THATS JUST AS RACIST!"" because some said wait for the facts. Yep - I'm with you on that. Publishing the wrong name could absolutely ruin someone's life. apparently he posted on [/pol/](http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/109855190/) $1,000,000 And that he posts on worldnews and t_d. And frequents /r/uncensoredwhitenews which is apparently a thing. That's a fool's bet. There's no way he wasn't on the_d. For those confused about this reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cole_Polytechnique_massacre What is this similar to? Sorry, am not Canadian Qubcois or French Canadian, not French.  I think he is very likely to have a Reddit account. I wonder if we will ever know it. Would be interesting to look at. Probably something along the lines of   >POL-KEK1488 3.) Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc. This article says that he posted a lot of anti-muslim heinous comments: http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/201701/30/01-5064465-le-suspect-connu-pour-ses-critiques-sur-facebook.php  ""Alexandre Bissonnette est connu dans le milieu communautaire de Qubec pour ses critiques en ligne. En voyant sa photo circuler dans les mdias comme le suspect dans la tuerie de dimanche soir, Franois Deschamps, qui gre la page du groupe Bienvenue aux rfugis, dit avoir reconnu immdiatement l'un de ses  trolls , soit une personne faisant du harclement en ligne.  a faisait un an qu'on le voyait aller , a-t-il dit."" To a lot of redditors, 'the left', 'the right', or just plain up trolls, there is a lot of hypocrisy.    For example,   > ""When Muslims kill over a hundred people it receives a #notallmuslims. But when a trump supporter kills people it receives a ""fucking trump supporters, fascist neo-nazis""""  But the far greater hypocrisy, from both sides is: Pretending to care about victims of any attack, when all you want to do is desperately confirm your bias on who carried out the attack. The police didn't release the names, they were leaked to the media.  It was a clerk who released the names, according to another article - she is most likely in some serious shit.  The police still didn't release any name. It's all the media. His life still is at risk. I was commenting something similar to that about 11 hours ago, when this news was beginning to circulate.   Fuck just printing a retraction. They need monetary fines. Severe ones. If they print something, they better be sure those things are true.  Edit: Ended my previous post today with; ""I'm sure there are flaws to that idea, but it can be worked on."" Honestly, I don't think they should ever be released, guilty or not. Giving a name to the crime only gives them the fame that they want.   Also too many people have been named to a crime they never committed but the news stories live on in people's minds wether it was true or not damaging an innocent life forever.  See: Fort Lauderdale Airport and a couple women in Dubai saying they got raped and thrown in jail. Like the ""BLM Kidnapping"". No connection to BLM, you imbeciles...gah. I just went to the thread from yesterday. At first it was fine but the comments quickly turned into ""it was obviously a muslim because I said it was"" and people throwing accusations left and right.  It's amazing how the racist right can't comprehend white people committing hate crimes.  Oh someone burnt down a mosque? Must be those crazy muslims!! White people could never do this! Now get out of my country arab.   DEPORT THE CANADIANS OUT OF CANADA NOW  This makes total sense, right? Right?  Seriously, wow these people.  I give it six days Gas-lighting themselves. That's a neat trick! /r/jackass's I've been doing that quite a lot these past few days English Translation: Mohamed Belkhadir, the engineering student arrested by mistake in the wake of the terrorist attack at the mosque in Sainte-Foy, was helping the victims when he was wrongly mistaken for a suspect.  Freshly returned home, the young man of 29 years was interviewed in La Presse to indicate it does not want all the police of Quebec, who was ""very nice"" with him.  ""I went in to try to give first aid to my friend on the ground, and I saw someone with a weapon. I did not know that he was a policeman, I thought he was coming back to shoot. So I fled outside, on the parking side, ""he said.  ""I understand, I respect that they caught me. They saw me flee, they thought I was suspicious, that's normal. For them, someone who flees is a suspect, ""he insists.  The student of Moroccan origin had attended the prayer on Sunday evening, then went out to clear the stairs of the mosque. Soon after, he heard several shots, for 15 to 20 seconds, he said.  He entered, called 9-1-1, gave the address to the emergency services, and then used his coat to warm a wounded man on the ground. It was then that he panicked when a policeman came in with his fist. Its sad, but you can understand how both parties reacted the way they did.  Cops trying to find a shooter, sees a man running from them  Man sees a person with a gun in a shooting and runs.  Its shame on who ever released his name It's weird listening to Sean Spicer's Press Statement on this. It almost seems like when he made the statement they thought one of the attackers was Muslim. He condemned the act and then said ""It's a terrible reminder of why we must remain vigilant and why the President is taking steps that are proactive rather than reactive when it comes to our nation's safety and security"". I was left trying to work out what has Trump done to minimize the likelihood of domestic hate attacks against Muslims? Jesus dick, I'm glad the officers did their job and didn't immediately shoot him when they saw him running.  With so many fatal police shootings in the news for far, far less, it's great to see some officers keeping it together. Good thing this wasn't in the US, because there would've been a good chance for the police to decide to just shoot him on the spot.  In Poland and most of Europe I believe, if you're charged with a crime, your face needs to be censored and your last name can only appear as an initial. No media witch hunts. I usually get downvoted to hell for saying this.  They aren't allowed to post kid's photos/info, why can they do it for adults?  Should have to wait until they're convicted unless there's like a manhunt and they need the public to look out for the person or whatever. Instead of money, he should demand they run a front page piece that clears his name. He gets his name cleared and the media gets some of its integrity back, so it's a win-win. It's definitely worth it, if only to make the media think twice in the future before jumping to conclusions and reporting irresponsibly. It was more a case of malevolence this time rather than incompetence like back then.  You know, the whole ""largest online white supremacist forum since Stormfront"" thing. Did this happen because of reddit? T_d first claimed it was two different Arabic names, then This guy and the real attacker, and now I see they've pulled all of it from the sub.  By all appearances, they are sucked into fake news more than anyone. Yeah, whenever some mass shooter's acquaintances describe him as ""shy, bullied, and socially awkward"" I'm like . . . some of us are OK? The majority of mass shooters live incredibly loney and isolated lives. Make no mistake, hate groups target people like this. They look for young men that are angry loners. It's a recruitment tactic. That's typically how any nefarious group recruits. Look at cults, ISIS, Al Qaeda, neo Nazis etc. They target disenfranchised people and fill the social void with harmful ideology.  you're right about 4chan, sources say he was on 4chan a couple of hours before the shooting https://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/109855190#p109855190 Reddit is a terrible example of everyday interactions with real humans. Reddit has gone completely off the deep end on both ends of the spectrum. Be sure of that friend, no population, race or religion can be all good or all evil and i know also that no citizen should be held responsible for politician acts and words . > she was just repeating something she saw on 4chan lol   That really should be embarrassing to admit.   It's disturbing how serious so many right wingers take 4chan.   I swear 4chan could say the sky is red and water is dry and it would be front page news in every right wing community. Lauren Southern is such a piece of shit lmao You should see my posts arguing with them in one of the other threads on this. Once those assholes smell blood in the water, they all pile on and they will follow you all the way down into the bowels of a comment chain to downvote you. [removed] This gon be juicy.  When I grew up I realized how retarded 4Chan is. It's a bunch of 12 year olds and 40 year olds acting like 12. Goddamn what a bunch of scumfucks its interesting how half of them are calling it a false flag and the other half are praising him. Gotta have that plausible deniability in the doublethink, right? Very good point.   On the same field, it bothers me when people feel like the ""others"" who preach violence and whatever are allowed, but that we somehow aren't.  I think you can criticize other cultures, even deep rooted behaviors of other people and still recognize that they're only people.  When I look at a white nationalist, I think: you know what? They're a person, too, why do they feel this way? I don't want them to come to my parties and turn it into a political bore, but like... how much non-white porn do they watch? [The Donald: Amazing how fast the story about the mosque shooting in Canada disappeared from r/all once the shooters were ID'd](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5r1mjs/amazing_how_fast_the_story_about_the_mosque/)   [Archived](https://www.reddit.com/r/AltFacts/comments/5r44vf/the_donald_amazing_how_fast_the_story_about_the/) Is it me, or is that frontpage specifically designed to appeal to people with severe ADHD? Huge titles, few stories, bunch of quick bullet points so you don't need to read the articles... It's even more troubling when you realize that Trump is basing key policy decisions off watching unsubstantiated Fox News reports instead of attending intelligence briefings.  They are exactly that what they accuse everyone else of being. Hilarious. :-) The biggest snowflakes  I missed what happened in that sub over there.  Were the using another tragedy to forward their agenda? Too bad this is what the front page right before that update: http://i.imgur.com/zrkOXVT.png  So someone only reading headlines would think, ""yeah, sure, LONE wolf, pfft, there's a whole pack of them coming into the country"", and not know that the attacker was actually the other guy. I would actually rather they take it down because it will show up in a Google search. They should also put stuff up pointing to the real shooter, but they won't. My apologies, forgot the /s According to them canadian pm framed that poor white guy I got downvoted yesterday to saying that sometimes you need context for attacks before you jump the gun.   This was in response to a huge list posted to me of trump supporters being attacked (all of which conveniently started seconds before, or only started after the attack).   Apparently I'm just a retarded reddit leftist and should be forced to be beaten because I didn't blindly accept whatever motives the youtube title had. (I even said I believe the attacks happen for those reasons, but context is still important regardless. Conveniently they ignored that bit)   Then the guys that replied to me turned around and immediately jumped on the ""LOL MUSLIM DID IT"" train.   These people know no nuance or hypocrisy.   I hope only that t_d will be quarantined or shut down. Especially after the doxxing stunt this time around.  They truly deserve to be punched in the face. Source: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C3bhyIKWMAICGJI.jpg:large >I hate to admit it, but if this is a lone anti-Muslim nut, I am just not all that upset. It's simply not a surprise. We have had decades of bloody Islamic terrorism, with a body-count that must be 5-6 figures by now. We have deluded multiculturalist/globalists who think Western culture needs to be ""enriched"" by mixing in lots of followers of a violent religion. So events like this are, in a sad way, natural.  What the fuck. So they are blaming Canadian PM now...amazing..tell me that they are just troll THE SHOOTERS ARE LITERALLY 2 SUPER MUSLIMS WHO CAME IN JUST 3 MINUTES AGO!!!11!! Olympic gold medal in mental gymnastics right there. Its so bizarre to read that subreddit today. Every day they talk about how we need round up and massacre all the jews and muslims, then they are super excited when a muslim suspect is identified in this shooting, but then silent when he is cleared and its one of their own. I guess its good that they dont immediately celebrate him as a hero, but I just dont understand the logic. The shooter is the true victim! /s > Kebab on Kebab on crime  i need to take a shower holy shit that phrasing makes me so uncomfortable jfc You see? It's for their own protection! No one cares more about Muslims than us. /s The alt reich To be fair, the Quebec media made a mistake by releasing his name as a suspect. They're also moving to a new talking point, [which is that all mass murderers are Democrat voters.](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5qxyze/shots_fired_in_quebec_city_mosque/dd2zqw5/) Well yea but you're required to pick a side on reddit. And if you don't choose one side, that means you are signing up for the other. There's no room for moderate reasoning or rationale. WHY WON'T THEY SAY THE WORDS??? Trump has galvanized the crazies across the world. Now they're playing the *neutral* ""*tsk tsk tsk both sides so quick to jump to conclusions*"" card.  We tend to not hire low IQ knee jerk idiots into our police forces up here. But there has been a few cases of guys on roids losing it. Make no mistake, authority can taint anyone who is given it. It is a mentally tough individual who can withstand the temptation to go full retard with their authority...except in many states it seems where the quality of policing has dropped drastically by the looks of things and all the cowardly and criminal acts carried out at a huge rate. He could've gotten shot, outside of Canada. Exactly. He even stated the police treated him relatively well ( trs gentils   from the La Presse Article, very nice). The media tone here in Quebec has, as you said, been mostly measured and professional. I stopped looking at the circus below us a long time ago. Criss, c'est Reddit, on lis juste le titre... Pis mme l, on le lit pas toujours comme y faut.  From a shooting, odd response Book 'em Lou. One count of being a bear, and one count of being an accessory to being a bear. Except the white nazis limp dick who was murdering all of them. https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5qywho/coulters_law_is_now_in_full_effect/  Gotta love it. 6,000 upvotes The worst part was I saw many comments over there to the effect of ""why are they trying to paint all anti-globalists with the brush of white supremacy"". Meanwhile they're perfectly fine painting all Muslims with the brush of radicalism. You openly suggested applying critical thinking skills in /r/The_Donald and weren't outright banned? Must've slipped through security.  edit:  The guy I'm replying to said  >""I got downvoted for saying context matters when you link videos of people being attacked (in response to someone linking a list of attacked trump supporters. To which I acknowledged it happens and is heinous). I was downvoted.  >These [redacted insult that probably got his comment removed] know no shame or irony. The doublethink is amazing.""  also apparently I'm an idiot for bringing /r/the_donald into this because I can't read and he didn't mention them. Exactly, I told them some of their videos are valid but others are from extremely biased/unreliable sources like YouTube or Alex Jones. They just like living in their own circle jerk to make validate themselves sometimes.  No way, that just doesn't add up. and CBC youtube coments and metacanada (neo-nazi forum) The altright sub for sure. They're real nazis for sure. Our Prime Minister is calling him a terrorist. No question. News over here are calling him a terrorist, as well as federal and provincial PMs. People in news outlets' comments on Facebook are supportive and bash hard on any hate speech that may come up.  I've never heard of this before. What the fuck.  I feel like I already read this very thread before. I'm having strong dj vu here  This is why we need Feminism https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cole_Polytechnique_massacre  One of the worst shootings in Canadian history was a university shooting in which the attacker was targeting feminists.  He don't speak American, that's all that matters /s nah it wouldnt be that interesting. pick any of the more retarded posts on r/the_donald, look at the op's comments and you'll find exactly what you'd expect to find on that kid's username.  it's all fun and games until you realize that subreddit harbors shooters. fucked up. Rough English translation of above.   Alexandre Bissonnette is known amongst the community organizations of Quebec City for his online commentary. On seeing [Alexandre's] photo circulate in the media as the suspect in the Sunday night slaughter, Franois Deschamps, who manages the ""Welcome to Refugees"" group's page, said he immediately recognized one of his ""trolls"", a person who harasses others online. ""We saw him doing that for a year,"" he said.  EDIT: slightly less rough translation based off of (and/or blatantly stolen from) repliers who speak much better French than I. Both of those are seeking to attack the same false narrative. Many Americans believe that Muslims are inherently dangerous and they are not. To confront this it is important to: 1) distinguish terrorists from Muslims, because only an insignificant number of Muslims are terrorists; and 2) illustrate that terrorism is not a Muslim specific issue by highlighting non-Muslim terrorism.  If I showed an average American a picture of Dylan Roof and a Syrian Refugee and asked, ""Identify the Terrorist,"" they would prick the refugee. That is the prejudice we must combat. >For example  There's a bit of difference in the specificity of each ideology.   It's pretty easy to note the difference between something like a white person killing someone and holding white people responsible versus a neo-nazi killing someone and holding nazi's responsible. That what I saw on twitter too. A city court clerk leaked the info to the media. Yeah, true. Didn't mean to insinuate it wasn't. Yeah, all it takes is another Edgar Welch with an AR-15 to ""self-investigate"" and he's dead. I'm guessing by tomorrow we'll hear conspiracy theories about how the Canadian government pinned it on Bissonnette, in order to protect Muslim extremists or something. They didn't print a retraction, but blamed AP. http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/30/only-1-man-arrested-in-quebec-mosque-terror-attack-is-suspect-police-say.html  Edit: should have quoted original text, FN keeps changing the text > and a couple women in Dubai saying they got raped and thrown in jail.  I never heard the corrected version of that one, what actually happened? See: McDonald's Hot Coffee case. And people still get upset and wonder why the mods shutdown the Orlando shooting thread You do know how Louisiana ended up with Creole right? So a non-white person flees from police at the scene of a shooting and doesn't get shot in the back. Instead he just gets questioned and the whole thing is cleared up. Canadian police showing other countries how it's done. Yes. Like he graciously said he understand and respect why police did that. Like you say, it's the fact that his name was released and how media handled it that raise serious questions. That reminds me a lot of [Mark Hughes](http://time.com/4399697/dallas-shooting-mark-hughes-false-suspect/). The media just doesn't give a shit. They want to be the first to report a story no matter the repercussions. I mean, it's just a guy's life at stake is all.  Edit: Inserted victim's name in place of generic. Thank God, he wasn't in the U.S. The cops would have lit him up for running. Well if he bans Muslims from America, they can't be hurt by domestic attacks. What a considerate man! He hasn't done anything. They're disgustingly using the attack to justify their Muslim ban. Deserves more votes. He also offered their support with 'any means necessary'. (I'm reading this as military).   Now I don't want to be paranoid, or anything, but I don't want to be casually invaded by the States on the guise of their 'here to help' campaign that has been going so well in the Middle East.   On the other hand, let's get to punching those Nazis.  Luckily police in Canada are usually pretty good about stuff like that.  You just broke my heart, cause I know its true. That's true in Canada for anyone under 18.  The issue with that is the balance between the public's right to know. In the common law system all criminal charges are considered to be on behalf of the public.  This picture shows the difference between Europe and US media (NSFW): http://imgur.com/wyP2eci  The whole reason to make arrest information public is to protect against government disappearances. If the government can arrest people and there's no public record of it, there's potential for serious abuse. Holy shit what 80s movie did you people grow up in? The media never loses integrity over bad reporting.  > ""largest online white supremacist forum since Stormfront""  Did reddit get that title?  edit: Oh god, why oh why did I comment in /r/worldnews? IMO it absolutely didn't, Reddit only started to believe it when the two names were on the front page of every major newspaper, not the other way around. It's the reporters that fucked up. Thus causes them to have a shockingly low amount of empathy towards others. They're in their own bubble and think it is acceptable to commit these heinous acts. The majority of redditors live incredibly loney and isolated lives. That's exactly what ISIS has been doing lately. I don't really know if I'd call that proof, that's like 90% of /pol/ posts.  Just a matter of time till they figure out his reddit login. Im sure his the_donald posts have tons of upvotes. Top journalist The stories and information posted here are artistic works of fiction and falsehood. Only a fool would take anything posted here as fact.  seems about right. I enjoyed that, in a thread on T_D where people were calling for deportation of all Muslims and how horrible Muslims are, people started complaining after the reveal that the Muslim was a witness and not a suspect that the left was painting all T_D supporters as extremists and terrorists. They somehow don't see how ridiculous that hypocrisy is. I know there are many of you guys and gals out their just like you and I just wanted to tell you that as a Muslim I appreciate you not jumping to conclusions, being reasonable and supportive. These days it feels like my words hold no value because people would just label me as a terrorist supporter regardless of if the actual person is even Muslim or not. Race and religion shouldn't be the key factor for these kind of issues but with the state of the world it can't be helped but people like you help us with the support needed. It's just not the same if the only people supporting and vocalizing us is just other Muslim's. Again thank you so much.  Most of the users in that sub are loser kids who still use 4chan.  Shame, all that karma gone to waste. Could've been somebody I would be shocked if he did not.  That's the way consumption is heading. Quantity over quality.  That's a lot of them at this point. FOX is hot trash but I won't pretend they're unique in the low-information, clickbait aspect. I've never seen a group so in need of a safe space in my life.

Still waiting for Reddit to take action regarding this shit, considering that's against the ToS. Trump supporters are the biggest precious snowflakes, they're such pussies who can't handle reality, that its their alt-right racist side that is violent. Did the sun rise today?  It's literally nothing more than a foot note when a white, right winged nutjob is behind it.  I only noticed this because I once made a comment that I thought was pretty obviously sarcastic. Something about evolution being a lie and satan is the cause of homosexuality, and god only allows sinners to be shot therefore we don't need any gun control, that atheism is the most evil religion, etc.  I got about 20 people pointing out how internally inconsistent I was, how I was ignoring facts and data, etc.  I spent another 20 minutes copy/pasting my follow-ups and how I didn't think I'd need to add the ""/s"" because of how straight-up retarded my post was.  It was a real eye-opener. And this was during the start of the American primaries. Things have only gotten more awkward since then.

He was bullied in high school, did not have friends. Students remember him as quiet and/or arrogant in high school.  >In other words, he was one of you guys. Not a refugee. Not a foreigner. One of your own.  I wonder how long until a mod finds the post and bans him... Who the fuck would make a law stemming from the vile mucous blob that is Ann Coulter? Never mind Timothy McVeigh or Anders Breivik. In both cases, Muslims were originally blamed. Well, twice now radicalized white men have entered specifically a place of worship to kill innocents.  But we're not looking into that because reasons. It was /r/worldnews or /news I don't remember. One of the two threads yesterday.   I got banned from t_d in the primary days for saying Sanders is nothing like Trump   E: In response to your edit, I agree with you. I just wanted to point out I didn't actually come to t_d and expect logic, I came to one of the news subs and had t_d users argue with me. I've been banned for t_d for ages, I expect no logic or critical thinking there at all (and yet somehow it still leaves me disappointed). Basically, I wouldn't even bother if was Oh that fuck is for sure all over youtube comments Here's r/metacanada having a [premature celebration](https://www.reddit.com/r/onguardforthee/comments/5r2hse/metacanada_celebrating_that_someone_with_an_arab/) that a Muslim (now a witness) was arrested for the shooting. Which alt-right sub? I wanna get a daily dose of cringe ya but his point is to put the label alt-right in there like trump and co do with the radical-islam label  We hold still hold yearly memorials at many campuses across Canada to this day. And Denis Villeneuve, who is from Quebec, directed a breathtaking [movie about this event](http://imdb.com/title/tt1194238/) before he became known in Hollywood.

That is correct, except ""Quebec City community"" is not the correct translation of ""milieu communautaire de Qubec"". The latter means something like ""among (=in the milieu of) community organizations in Quebec City"" Kind of depends on the picture used though.

I can bet $5 there's already a suggestion on all the usual loonie-world subreddits. That one is a little different, that one is not knowing the full story, the other ones are just grabbing at a little snippet from a developing story. A little different, but similar. That was 100% the media's fault.  They spun that into some wild nonsensical tale just to make it more interesting.    Actual Story: McDonald's makes coffee dangerously hot because they say customers want it hotter than a volcano.  Coffee melts cup, spills in woman's lap and is so hot it melted a bunch of her skin (including her genitals) and she has to get surgery.  News Story: Dumb woman pours hot coffee in lap, sues McDonald's because coffee was hot.  This was the first time I'd realized that what was said on the news was not necessarily true.  This differs because the media purposely spun the story to make it more outlandish.  It wasn't them reporting before they had the details. Watch the documentary. The damage was worse than you can imagine from hot coffee Yups, with the Acadian Deportation. Pretty much, after the Conquest War in the mid-18th century, the English felt the French residents of what-was-to-become-Canada were fucking too much shit up, so they deported a vast part of the Acadians  And Creole is actually the language spoken in Haiti. Surely you mean Cajun, right?  Yeah, in this case it's the news outlets that fucked him over. Yeah, i have a mountain of respect for this guy.  Very rational, and level headed CBC has a policy of not saying a name until they've been charged, mad props to them for that. Richard Jewell is another good example - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Jewell My thoughts exactly. US cops would have shot him in the back as he ran Can Canada maybe please invade the U. S.?  > In the common law system all criminal charges are considered to be on behalf of the public.  It is not a criminal charge to be a suspect. It's ""technically it is possible that this guy did it"", and that is not for the public to decide.  Being charged, and the name being released, I guess so, yes. Having your entire reputation ruined overnight because some people died near you? No. The guy was not charged. Just detained. .... I have literally never thought about it that way before but it makes total sense. bullshit, the reason news articles post names is so they're the ones with the information first, so everyone clicks on their site to read the article.  It doesn't really matter if it's true or not, they just need the clicks. Yeah. In reality it'll be a three sentence retraction on the bottom corner of page 7.   Obligation fulfilled. What's wrong with what /u/laptopaccount is suggesting? I don't get it.  In the Netherlands a newspaper lost a lawsuit and had to clear a man's name because his face was clear in a picture of a policeman controlling cars because of terrorism, and it looked like he was suspicious. And all they did was report news with an actual picture of controls.  Is it that weird to request a correction by that man in Canada? Doesn't seem far fetched at all. Lmao yeah what's all this idealism? You can suefor random shitlike that... Like MLK Jr's wife sued the FBI for an apology and won as an example What do you think separates The New York Times and Dailymail? Yeah, you're right... No difference between the BBC and Fox News. reddit wears it like a badge of honor sometimes Has had it for sometime.  It has been a white nationalist recruiting ground for much longer.  Edit: oh geez my grammar was awful. Yea but for some reason Reddit users like to pretend the entire site is a homogeneous racist cesspool. The news source said they traced the ip address back to someone in quebec if im not mistaken This is precisely what drives me up the wall. If they want to cry victim, sure. It's annoying but there is validity to it. But to turn around and do exactly what they're complaining about to someone else? How do you keep that kind of cognitive dissonance from exploding your brain? I don't mean to be offensive here at all, but I am an atheist and am generally opposed to most organized religions. That does not mean I think religion should be eliminated through legislation or military action or that one religion should be targeted over another. But I think religion will disappear if enough people are given a good education and tragedies like this shooting won't happen anymore. Unfortunately, that time is a long way off.    I withheld judgement on this issue because there was enough of a WTF vibe about the initial reports that it wasn't logical to assume it was religious sectarian violence, especially in Canada. Don't let the loud and verbal minority keep you from feeling that you have a voice and deserve to be heard.  The problem is people with fundamentalist ideals, these assholes come in all shapes, races, political backgrounds, and religions.  Thank you for voicing your thoughts :)  Like you said, there are many of us who know you and most Muslims are good people. Pretty sure you can use that to buy toothpaste and gum at the prison commissary, so not all is lost.   Source: am toothpaste  He's a very nice man who people are mean to. They emulate the man who emboldened them to voice their hate and intolerance.  That *is* their safe space. *sniff* Seriously. /u/spez is enabling these monsters by allowing them more leeway than the rest of us. I'm not even talking about taking a stand against hatred as we have seen from other companies and organizations these past 3 days. We're just talking about fairly applying the fucking rules of the website to everyone. I feel Reddit needs to straight-up admit that they no longer have the energy or time to keep up with the professional trolls, neo-fascists, and haters and just start blanket-banning.   If the Tumpettes want to be left alone to post their libelous, hate-filled filth then let them start their own website (Herdit) and give each other nazi-boners all they want.  And then maybe, just maybe, we can have a grown-up discussion with real-life conservatives that have valid, reasonable opinions and aren't just trying to burn everything to the ground.  I'm not a conservative, but I do respect and honour the tradition of conservatism in the political arena. We are all better for it, provided it isn't high-jacked by the nazi element. Because fuck them. Wow, some of those comments are straight up calls to kill Muslims. Aren't there laws against that? As the sun rises in the East, I'm pretty sure sunshine won't be allowed back into the US for a while. Last night, both /r/The_Donald on Reddit and /pol/ on 4chan were having a circlejerk about [Coulter's Law.](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5qywho/coulters_law_is_now_in_full_effect/)  They were ecstatic when the name ""Mohammed Khadir"" was leaked online by sites like [The Daily Caller.](http://dailycaller.com/2017/01/30/breaking-news-quebec-city-attacker-on-mosque-identified-as-mohamed-khadir/)  Absolute silence this morning about Alexandre Bissonnette because they are too busy making memes about [Chuck Schumer's tears.](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5r0dq4/president_trump_only_109_people_out_of_325000/) I predicted this earlier in the /r/Canada thread. Just call it a cover up and continue to use alternative facts lol ALT-COMMENTS.  It's the Jews' fault for the holocaust! If they weren't around, the Nazis wouldn't have to kill them all! /s  We're dealing with monsters here. How do people get so fucked in the head? Quand t'es pas sure, utilise les deux pis t'as raison la moiti du temps... No no. Its ok because he only killed some would be terrorists in a mosque that were probably planning a bombing. ^^/s From my experience it takes them about 5 to 10 hours. Source have recently been banned from r/altright r/Hillaryforprison and r/conservative. I was banned from all 3 for offering up a view and opinion different from what their safe space wants. From altright I only posted the poem on the status of liberty.  White supremacists. You mean Charleston?

When I say they're real nazis I'm not exaggerating.   /R/altright  Ten seconds is all it will take but if you search around you'll find some really fucked up stuff. It's not even a small subreddit... They have more members than the subreddit for the city I live in. /r/altright  More like ""ain't right"" if you ask me. My university even has a memorial space dedicated to those grim events. I always pass by it when I head to the bus loop; a sobering reminder of the evil that exists in this world.  He clearly said that he was killing those women because he hated feminists. He asked them before shooting: are you feminist?  You are correct, though in his mind shooting female engineering students was the same as targeting feminists, which is what he had told a student. By the end, he was even shooting men.  I dunno if you are new to the internet but for almost the entirety of the MRAsphere the term feminist is interchangeable for women. Kind of like for racists every black man ever is in BLM Yes, good point to bring up. More like ""we saw him do that for a year""  Christ, he probably got all his kill crazy rage from people making fun of his stupid haircut. >Gold's Gym  What an absolute dickhead  ""Just some good ol' boys, never meanin' no harm."" McDonalds had also been warned about the temperature being dangerous and the woman only wanted the money to pay her medical bills. The coffee did not melt the cup. You are mistaken. Yeah... I read that and totally agree. The coffee they used to serve through the window in little flimsy cups was something like 190 degrees.... basically that will have the same effect as full 210F boiling water. The woman deserved every penny she got for her horrific injuries.  I think that's what his point was, that people would read the headline but not know what really happened throughout the case. Ah, up here in french history class it's referred to as Creole which apparently means any stable combo language. Wikipedia says there's dozens of examples, a lot from the Caribbean.  I just thought it's funny that exactly this situation has happened in the past. And Canadian The CBC named two suspects this morning. It was quickly taken down when the police tweeted that there was only one suspect and a witness. I know because I searched both names from that article.  it did not make any sense to me why a Muslim and a Canadian would both be suspects in a shooting at a mosque. So I waited for official word before jumping to conclusions.  And then everyone would be like, ""Well, it's his fault for running from a cop."" I can't believe its come to this in fucking America of all places. The public record of arrests is to prevent still a different type of tyranny.  The police can't ""disappear"" people if they need to keep public records of everyone they have in custody.  Yeah.  The problem is tricky.  The public have a right to know, but it shouldn't be broadcast by the media either.  In my opinion, stuff like this is why legislation is so hard to write. In Germany the article clearing somebody's name or a factual false article has to be as big and on the same page as the article which defamed the person. The Atlantic ocean  Yeah, Reddit users love to generalize all of Reddit. Except for themselves Yeah we're up North and everything but there's still 8 million people living in Quebec and igloos are a form of entertainment, despite some still quite popular beliefs.  [Meese](https://i.imgur.com/6WlJbA8.jpg) are still metal as fuck as ever though. Easy. A daily dose of Fascist Lies from knock-off De Fhrer It's pretty simple.  Step 1: Believe you're right  Step 2: Use whatever you're discussing to reinforce that belief. I know, not all Trump supporters are like them. But these guys sure are many and they sure are loud and whiny. And you cannot reason with them. They're like some idiot in school who keeps saying ""dickface"". Arguments don't work. They either grow out of it, or they stay in there forever. I started using their rhetoric now against them. You wouldn't believe how much it teases them. it's okay man. My best friend is an atheist. I know exactly what you mean and I respect your opinion and do not take any offense. At the end of the day we just need to be decent human beings. Have a good day man.  The thing that pisses me off about this so-called ""Coulter's Law"" is that *Canadian police and press are more careful and responsible about throwing information out there than in the States*. Ann Coulter should know; she's had run-ins with Canadian authority. That was happening all over this sub too. Worldnews is full of a bunch  of fuckin' nazis. CLINTONS drove the getaway car!!  They're scared, and insecure, and desperate. People do (and think) crazy shit when they're like that.  Doesn't justify shit, and they can all kiss my black ass, but at least we know why. > poem on the status of liberty.  Roses are red  Nothing is true  We blame all the Muslims  For things they don't do  Subs like that, ones the favor one political party exclusively, are there as an echo chamber. They serve no other purpose so I'm not surprised you were banned from them.  Creole French is pretty different from Chiac French (Which is a blend of french and english, and is the dialect mostly used in French communities in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick)   I'm French Canadian, so I learned a fair bit about it at school. There have also been deportation of the French Patriotes in the 1840's, after their revolt against the Loyalists (people faithful to England) failed.  Canada has a fascinating history, really.  Hell, he probably even apologized for creating such a ruckus. I get the joke, but boy does it bug me to no end. There are many irrational Canadians who will never forgive this man for doing nothing wrong, unfortunately it is just as Canadian as it is human, or American, or English, or Arabian, or Russian.  Technically correct, the best kind Man I hate people who generalize, they are all dummies. Last night I asked for data on this ""law"". Seriously, they could start collecting data right now and document it on twitter so they can prove that's an actual thing (probably won't show anything of significance). They can have:  * Time of suspect apprehended * Time of first instance of suspect name leak * Time of official announcement of name, race, and religion * Name, Ethnicity, and Religion * Region that the crime or attack took place   And then they can use that data to see if there is some sort of State or Media bias. That would be a healthy discussion for all of us. But no, they'll continue to be irrational.  If you sorted by mass downvotes in the thread last night you could see everyone calling out their bullshit. Pretty funny. I had one trying to tell me ""they were on our side"", keep your vitriol and disgusting rhetoric out of my country please. Especially not on the bodies of 6 of our dead. Fuck you.  Don't forget the Russian shills  I know people call Trump supporters Neo-Nazis but they're not. They're quite right wing and they're entitled to be sure, though I wish their sub was less of an echo chamber, but they're not outlandishly racist and prone to violence.  The altright subreddit users on the other hand, they are literal, 100% Neo-Nazis. Full belief that the Holocaust never happened, believe that the world is run by a Jewish elite, that the white race is superior to all others and that women are to be subjugated to men. One user was claiming Hitler hadn't gone far enough with the Jews, while at the same time denying that there was ever a genocide. It's easily the most cancerous subreddit right now. I'm from Quebec but lived in Louisiana. First time I heard a Cajun I didn't know what the hell he was saying, in French or English haha All blanket statements are dumb  EMAILS!!!! The altright one sounds insane! I remember this thought that was weirdly accurate. The people who believe that the Holocaust didn't happen are the same people who really wish it did. It's bewildering. Only a sith deals in absolutes

"26",25,"5r207c","2017-01-30",">About 9,000 names - nearly all German - are on the Auschwitz garrison list, some with photographs attached.  Wow I would not have guessed that 9,000 people were involved. > The INR hopes the list will prove that Auschwitz was not a Polish-run camp.  Do people actually think that the death camps were run by Poles? The issue of whether Poles held pogroms is a matter of historical debate, but I have yet to hear anybody think the SS was Polish. >More than a million people died there.  Holy shit. I knew millions died during WW2 in battle and in concentration camps, but I thought a single camp would be like 100-200k. One million just from Auschwitz alone is far more than I thought. Anyone know how many are still alive? I didn't see that in the article Never ever forget.  Hope no one takes the list and starts harassing descendants. Lets just hope people dont use the list of names to track down descendants of the Staff in order to exact some kind of revenge.  From the article:   > The INR hopes the list will prove that Auschwitz was not a Polish-run camp. More than a million people died there.  > the institute hoped to compile similar lists for other Nazi camps in occupied Poland.  > In cases where a person has stood trial, judicial documents relating to the case are included with the documents.   [The list itself](www.truthaboutcamps.eu/zalogass) as linked-to by [thenews.pl](http://www.thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/291201,Poland-publishes-names-of-former-Auschwitz-guards)   Note: Doesn't seem to be publicly available in English just yet. [This](http://en.truthaboutcamps.eu/) is what shows up, instead.   **[The list](http://pamiec.pl/pa/form/60,Zaloga-SS-KL-Auschwitz.html)**  [The portal to the list](http://truthaboutcamps.eu/th/zaloga-ss-kl-auschwitz/documentation-en)   Edit: Correction the second. The names are not yet around from what I've found so far. Anyone have a better link?   Final edit: The list is up.  **[The list](http://pamiec.pl/pa/form/60,Zaloga-SS-KL-Auschwitz.html)** As a german:   This is a good thing. To this day in our small town EVERYBODY knows who committed certain crimes at the end of the war, but the publishers of a book about the war censored it. Oh, and they remain some of the wealthiest families in town.   Don't forget the crimes.   Don't forget the names*.   Draw consequences.    Edit: *as in personal name. There are a lot of people who were involved who kids and grandkids are now wealthy, but they have buried the truth with their use fake names. I'm half-German, and searching the German-language list for my last name (which, I will note, is a very common last name in Germany). I've always wondered if there was a family link to the Nazis- my father says he's pretty sure there never was, but I'm curious if maybe something connects through extended family or something.    Obligatory note that obviously being German does not automatically mean a connection to Nazis. I fucking hate these types of articles.  Oh hey, someone put something online so we will write an article talking about it but won't actually give you the link because why would you want to look at it yourself? In other news :   >German historians say it's political motivated and there will be most likely no new revelations.  Anyone left alive will be in their nineties. Somehow I can't summon any hatred toward a toothless old fart who can't see or hear, and who thinks Kennedy is still president. Just checked. Wish I hadn't now! Polish family name which isn't/wasn't very common in Poland, my Grandfathers full name even less so. What a surprise! I need to double check his date of birth this evening to make 100% sure I've not got it wrong, but the other detail present is correct. Oh well. Fuck balls :( That would explain why my father had such detailed and real stories of his escape from Poland with his sister and mother, and other Poles. Whilst my Grandfathers time during the war was never spoken of. So nobody's going to notice it?   >It has been *hailed* as the most...    If only they could get an equally comprehensive list of inmates  To people who disbelieve the holocaust happened, this will do very little to persuade them otherwise.  For people who think Poles were the ones in charge of death camps, this will again be shrugged off as a list of fake names.  I feel like this might negatively affect the relatives of these people. Do you remember how hard middle school was? Now imagine your classmates find out your grand pappy was part of one of the worst regimes in human history; third only to the communist governments of the USSR and China, and certainly the worst Europe has ever seen.  Here in the states, we have a thing called HIPA, which protects a person's medical history. One of the stores in my hometown used to be a pharmacy in the 1920s, and they found an old list of scripts on an antique pharmacist's pad. Thinking nothing of it (these people would all be long dead by now), they put the scripts in the window as a novelty. Well this was a violation of HIPA, and in fact one of the grandchildren complained because it had their relative's name, and they didn't want people to know he needed to take morphine.   I don't know where I stand with this. I am glad that the list exists, and would never want to hide the information. In an ideal world we could publish this list, and people would take it at face value and read nothing more into it. Hopefully the populace can be cool enough that they don't cause any derision to relatives of the death camp workers. Why is a list of all of their names necessary? That's just an attempt to defile their family name. Pretty fucked up if you ask me. Go Poland! Many of the SS had far too clean a deaths. Hopefully the Soviet Union treated them with a lot more brutality than the west did. Yeah lets deny that thousands of polish citizens worked in those death camps.  And they were not even new to idea of polish run deathcamps - they used them in the 20's to kill 60-100 thousands of soviet soldiers. But were praised for it cause its ok to kill communist pigs. any chance Trump on dat list ? Weren't some of the German army prisoners that were forced to fight? Only the SS commanders and troops should be listed, IMO.  Heiled* FTFY Link to this database? Does anyone have a link to the website. Has anyone found a link to the list? I'd like to search it. ""So tonight I'm gonna party like its 19(84)"" 70 Years late. I'll make sure to bring this thread up whenever I encounter the ""move away from the past and don't be a whiny bitch"" people prevalent in news about WW2 controversies. to bad they just changed their names and went to south america to live like kings... ""Hailed"" Does anyone has got a link of the list? Not sure, but maybe non-German guards have been working for the SS there. There have been a few Dutch participants in the Waffen SS. Not really for concentration camps, I guess.  Anyway, finding a Dutch name on such a list would still be a burden for the people with the same surname - even if there's no family relationship.  Suppose, for sake of the argument, a Dutch politician finds his surname on the list.. press would start digging. i don't see the reason for this  after the guilty were punished, the name should have been forgotten.  why grant these animals the least bit of recognition for what they did? Good.  As time grows short and the generation that lived through the horrors of WWII and the Holocaust pass on, it is important to preserve this kind of information, and ensure it is available. I don't disagree.   I didn't make my point very clear so that's my fault. I was trying to say that it's very easy now for us to look back at people like that and immediately condemn them and proclaim that we would have made the other choice.   I don't know anyone who had to live under the Nazi regime. I have no real understanding of what's it like to be put under the boot of another group of people who would kill me without a second thought for refusing an order. Of course I'd like to think that I would have, but it's just not realistic.   My view on it is that while I'm not trying to excuse what any collaborators may have done, I'm not going to condemn them all right off the bat. Now, depending on what that collaboration was, there are certain actions that there is no possible circumstance that could make me view them as anything but traitors who should be dealt with.   But a police officer who is forced to continue working under who knows what type of threats shouldn't be dismissed just for that. I can understand why someone would do that if the alternative is their death and the deaths of their families. I would never expect anyone to put the lives of strangers, even friends, before theirs and their family's.  At the end of that day, a strangers life will never be more important to a person than the lives of their children, wives, siblings, etc.   Anybody who aids the enemy in the fight or occupation of their own people should be held to the most severe consequences, I will never disagree there. But it's not black and white, and while it would be no doubt much simpler and easier to just condemn everyone regardless of what their ""collaboration"" entailed and what exactly made them choose that path, is buying into the same kind of totalitarianism that started that war in the first place.   Really I think the only thing I am disagreeing with you about is judging every person accused of collaborating as guilty regardless of what they actually did and why. Especially since I'm preeeetty sure neither of us has any idea what it truly must have been like to be in their shoes.    Honestly I'm not very well informed on any of the specifics of the Nazi's occupation of other countries so I'm not specifically defending any particular actions by anyone.   This would be a really interesting discussion to have face to face, I really did a horrible job of explaining myself but I appreciate you taking to time to engage  Whooo  Good job I never told anyone my real name.  My mate Hernam is gonna be pissed as they musta thought his name was a typo.  Oh well back to watching t.v, I love Argentina's version of Deal or No Deal This seems a little insensitive towards (living) children of these people. Good. I look forward to a future list of climate criminals who held the world back from responding.  [removed] Do they have the Jewish people policing their own people to stay alive names down? Or is that a sensitive subject? Let this be a reminder to all the Police in America, you may be above the law now, but your family name will forever remain on a list just like this. Soon, we will see the names of Israeli commanders and soldiers on a similar list. Most comprehensive list? I mean, how incomprehensive can a list of names really be? It can't be hard to comprehend a list of names. Is George Soros on the list? Heroes. We shall never forget their sacrifice.  [removed] I can see the U.S. implementing something like this sometime in the future if Trump keeps going down the rabbit hole. Ill get started on the new list:  -Donald Trump  -Steve Bannon  -Kellyanne Conway  -Mike Pence  ... George Soros name on that list by any chance? I feel like someone's gonna hack this list and put trumps grandpas name on it, only to find out it's already there  Because making lists of names public is alway good. Anyone got a list of Mossad agents and Jewish Pedophiles because...stuff. Not all SS/Germans were bad, I had a great uncle in the SS that felt he should write a letter directly to Hitler telling him there were issues with the camps; he died in the gas chamber for his efforts. ""It's been hailed as the most comprehensible lost to date"" List of trump voters!  At some point the masses will want to blame someone!  Let the blamin begin! It was a factory of death. Over a million people passed through Auschwitz. It was as large as a small city. I recently visited Auschwitz, and when you're walking through it you can believe it. It's horrible how large and efficient it all was.  >The issue of whether Poles held pogroms is a matter of historical debate    [It's really not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedwabne_pogrom) It was [invented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_114#Operations_to_whitewash_German_responsibility_for_World_War_II) by a former *Abwehrpolizei* to whitewash German responsibility from the Holocaust.   Along the same lines, nobody refers to Guantanamo as a Cuban detention camp. A lot of news media to this day refer to Auschwitz etc as ""Polish death camps"" instead of ""Nazi-run death camps in occupied Poland"". Not surprising that this pisses off the Poles. >  The issue of whether Poles held pogroms is a matter of historical debate  There's not much debate about it actually. You'd be surprised, I live in Canada and in grade 10 we were taught that during WW2 Poles charged panzer tanks on horseback.  We were shown a video of this. I looked this up a couple years ago, it's just Nazi propaganda designed to make the Poles look stupid.  And for some reason it was being taught in a Canadian public school as fact and still might be to this day Even BBC recently in their article said that Poles were involved in running death camps. They've corrected the article on the 28th of January this year. So yeah... it happens in media almost every single week. It's fucking annoying.  Here's the link: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38745115  At the bottom of the article it says:  ""Correction 28 January 2017: This article has been amended to remove a reference to Polish train drivers being among those who collaborated with Germany. They were in fact conscripted back into work by force after the German occupation.""   No I don't get this. The polish have been running a constant campaign about it not being polish concentration camps, but nazi ones. I've never met someone who has even a basic grasp of intelligence think concentration camps were Polish at not nazi. You'd be surprised how many. Everyone who takes their ""knowledge"" of history from movies and mass media is susceptible to such lies. Ask people what they know about WW2 and most likely you will have a nonsensical recollection factoids which are taken straight out of movies, games and thin air rather than historic accounts.  There are also two major actors promoting the idea for political reasons:  * Jewish sources/some - there is a deliberate and concerted effort to paint Poles as sharing the responsibility for the Holocaust among many Jewish communities and organizations in America and the major ones (ADL) are either supporting it or not doing anything to change it - it helps as a political and cultural blackmail when Jewish organizations demand return of Jewish-owned properties that were nationalized after WW2 by the communist government.  These individuals tend to be linked to right-wing politics in Israel and America. So they slander preposterously to achieve material gain, and don't bother that there are numerous Jewish and Israeli public figures who oppose and protest such behaviour.Just recently [Shevah Weiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shevah_Weiss) who is a former Israeli ambassador to Poland, Yad Vashem director, member of the Knesset and generally a very educated man who happens also to be the survivor of the Holocaust spoke openly against these slanders. But who cares...   * German sources/some - There is a quite extensive effort on part of many German organizations who hope that by drawing attention to ""inherent Polish anti-semitism"" and distorting the clear optics of who ran the camps. Whether by repetitive ""accidental"" use of ""Polish death camps"" by the likes of ARD or ZDF - public TV stations in Germany or by counting German Jews as German and emphasizing that ""Germans were also in the camps"" while denying the same logic to Poland which had its Jewish population wiped out they try to shift the blame away from Germany. Paradoxically that only confirms another thing that many people want to avoid  - Nazis were *German*, expressed German nationalism and fought for German interests and Geramny did not ""suffer under Nazis"". It suffered under itself.  Why German government will punish Holocaust denial  but will not punish this is also interesting. And as usual the people who push those agendas are exactly the sort of people who would support Nazis if it were 30s today - the left in Germany doesn't have a problem admitting the truth about history, partly because they were not part of it ideologically.  The most disgusting thing about it however is that it is absolutely cynical. Both the Jewish and German individuals involved in this preposterous behaviour **know** they are lying. They are doing it to stir up controversy, divert attention, provoke extremist responses. In other words they are spitting in your face on purpose knowing that it will enrage you and they cover their intentions by ""oh it's just language, what we meant to say is that these are Polish because they are in Poland"".  To people in Poland this is just as bad as Holocaust denial. As a matter of fact **It is Holocaust denial**. Saying that someone else did it is just as bad as saying nobody did.  So when is German government going to slap fines and prison sentences on their own journalist for doing this...?  As someone who lost members of family in these ""Polish"" camps I am waiting quite anxiously.   They've been accused of that. A lot. For real. I think (but i may be wrong, because russia) that Poland lost a larger percentage of its overall population than any other country in Eurooe during ww2. I think something like 1/3rd of all poles died in the holocaust I remember hearing that the Polish government had or was going to make the words ""Polish Death Camps"" illegal to publish, under the justification that it makes people think that the Poles ran death camps during the holocaust.   Which, as an American, I thought was completely crazy, since I've never heard anyone in my life mistakenly think that the death camps in Poland were run by anyone but the Nazis, and it seems like actually *outlawing the words* would just draw attention to the non-issue. Its not an issue as to whether the Poles held pogroms - they did, both before and after the war.   Also, perhaps the camps werent run by Poles...but the Poles knew full well about the camps and about the persecution of Jews and little was done to help that. If you ever get the chance to visit Aushwitz or Birkenau you will see homes which predate the camp, surrounding the camp. To this day, Poland, which once upon a time had a large Jewish population, has no Jewish population. Anti semitism remains rampant and revisionist history of Poland during WWII is the norm.  Why does it matter whether it was run by Poles or Germans?  As long as we all agree it was a pretty horrible thing to do, does assigning blame at this point achieve anything?  In 20 years everybody who could concievably have worked at any of these camps will be dead, whether they be German, Austrian, Polish, or anything else.  I mean, I get that we should be accurate when recording history, but having this other agenda of ""proving"" who's to blame (or not) seems pointless. While the Nazis on trial certainly spewed a lot of bullshit, there is also the issue of Polish people helping recapture escaped Jews.  ""We Europe now! Look at our European Values!"" Yep. It was a pretty horrible place.  Auschwitz was more of a concentration city than a concentration ""camp""  edit: my grandma was there for 4 years. she had some stories.  edit 2: grandma on the jew side not the nazi side. I'd be a little less proud of her if she were on the nazi side :) Way more then a million. I think the final tally was 4.1 million deaths at Auschwitz. Yeah, they were pretty good at their jobs.  Can't be a lot. If you were born in 1927, you were 18 at the end of the war and 90 today. I would believe that - while there were 16-yo soldiers towards the end of the war - the guards would have been 18+, commanders obviously much older.  Far as I saw, I don't know if there's any number for that written anywhere.  > Never ever forget.   A lot of people don't believe in the Holocaust. They believe it was a lie and wildly exaggerated.  Like Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas for instance. He [wrote an entire book about it](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Other_Side:_The_Secret_Relationship_Between_Nazism_and_Zionism). He believes the Holocaust was, (*and I quote,*) ""a fantastic lie."" How many do you think remember for example Khmer Rouge or the Holodomor? It's all in the past, left to be forgotten. Never forget what? That'd be the worst outcome of this.   The descendants never did anything, but people seem to derive some weird pleasure from harassing them.  As a descendant I'm actually kinda worried about this.    Can't find the list though. I'm hoping for more of descendants realizing they're descendants  ""Oh fuck, grandpa wasn't a medic like he said"" Oh, it's bound to happen. People need an outlet for their frustration, granite blocks and windows can't hold their attention forever. too bad millions of people from these camps never had descendants >The list in Polish  It's in english, german and polish. I am unable to find the database on the [site](http://en.truthaboutcamps.eu/). Can someone please post a link to it please? Thanks for posting the links. That was way too goddamn hard to find from the article and even their website. > Don't forget the names.  Holding the people who commited the crimes responsible for them even decades after the war is morally defendable to me, but punishing their children and grandchildren for carrying the same name is not. Fine, they can get a new name to distance themselves but many families have other non-nazi relatives they would not want to distance themselves from and most families are very attached to their family name. People do not choose to be born, and they do not choose their biological parents.  Just don't treat the unrelated people (as in kids or pretty much anyone born after the whole cabacle happened, revanschism is bad). badly.  >Don't forget the crimes.  Certainly not!  >Don't forget the names.  Ehh... I guess not?  >Draw consequences.  Okay definitely don't do that.  Look, I'm going to say this both for you and for the sake of anyone else reading this thread: people reform. You might like to think that some people are just evil, and that once a villain always a villain, but in reality people can change just fine. I mean, even Josef ""Angel Of Death"" Mengele went on to be a fairly ordinary doctor, saving other people's lives and not hurting anyone. You might think attacking (not necessarily phsically) an ex-Nazi means you're doing justice, or making things even, or getting revenge or something, but in reality you'd just be attacking a now-harmless person because you can't accept that they're not the same man they used to be. How can we really not forget if their names are effectively banished from written record? I'm not accusing you, but it seems remarkable that you can still sit next to a SS member on a bus in Germany and not know it. Seems, as a white American, as though we are supposed to continually apologize and make up for slavery / Native American abuses (though there are more recent problems, most of the true massacres and violence happened generations ago). Meanwhile 11+ million were killed by the Germans only two generations ago but that is routinely swept under the rug.   It still amazes me how plain greedy and money grabbing the Nazis were, especially as that's what they accused everyone else of.  So? Is that a bad thing? Should these people suffer for what their ancestors did? Wasn't joining the Hitler Youth compulsory for all male children in Nazi Germany for a number of years? I think most German-Americans came before the first world war.  I'm german and swedish (how they kept me pure I will never know) but like 5th generation american, on all other sides (mom was born in England, to Americans).    I've found my last name (and other surnames in my family) on several different lists of Nazi and SS documents.  It's pretty weird, but all of my grandparents were in the US and fighting for the US during the war (though one was in intelligence, so you never know).  The surnames all go back to like the 12th century though so it's kinda hard to feel any real relation.    As far as we can tell none of my family ever owned slaves either (American slaving times, I'm sure I'm related to either slave or slaver from some point in history).    I'm also the only blonde in my family, and I'm a dude.   I put the link in the comments as a follow-up to the article.   [Here it is](http://truthaboutcamps.eu/th/zaloga-ss-kl-auschwitz/documentation-en) It's not about hating them. This is the INR responding to ignorant arseholes who think that Auschwitz was Polish-run.  there is an aushwitz documentary on netflix, some of the old guards and pretty un-repentant  still bragging about shit they stole from prisoners during intake etc... :(  If you had read the article, or even the comments, you would know that it's because some people claim that Auschwitz included Poles running it, when actually it was run by German Nazis inside occupied Poland. Duuuurrrhhhhh woaw yuo r so clevar adn oreigenel  You mean like captured Soviet troops? I doubt they put them to guard camps and preferred them in the fronts. Concentration camps were run by the SS. > Not sure, but maybe non-German guards have been working for the SS there. There have been a few Dutch participants in the Waffen SS.   50.000 Dutch in the SS-legions/Waffen-SS alone.    >Not really for concentration camps, I guess.  There was a small Dutch SS unit called ""SS-Wachbataillon Nordwest"" whose primary task was guarding concentration camps.      But when you joined the Waffen-SS you could be rotated to any part of the ever-expanding SS-empire, including the concentration camps. It seems that the SS increased the number of non-Reichsdeutsche in the KZ-system towards the end of the war.   So it was quite common for SS-personal being shifted around between combat units in the Waffen-SS and concentration camps.      The KZ-system was totally integrated into the Waffen-SS with all the ""classical"" W-SS divisions being formed near KZ-camps. The KZ-prisoners would eg. provide work detachments that would clean the W-SS barracks or help build structures etc.      The KZ-camps also manufactured SS-uniforms or weapon systems, just like they provided funding for the SS in general.     Even whole regular W-SS units could be shifted into temporary KZ-camp guard duty, typically by guarding ""Aussenkommandos"".    Won't someone think if the children!!! so edgy Attempting to make this comparison is an insult to people that were affected by the holocaust  New names are found all the time. The full death toll of WW2 and the Holocaust might never be known, but at least the record can be completed as well as possible. Wait, who're you on about?  It's not like the other genocides are *never* spoken about.   Maybe the jews are talking about this one so much because it *happened to them?*  Because this was the largest genocide in history, it was extemely well organized, industrialized, and killed between 12 and 15 million in under 6 years. That's a minimum of 5,475 people a day. We ought to remember it. We ought to remember any genocide. The Rwandan genocide should never be forgotten. The Armenian Genocide shouldn't be forgotten. The genocide in Serbia shouldn't be forgotten. And the Holocaust certainly shouldn't, lest we repeat it I dont know...maybe because the 6 MILLION Jews killed representing 80% of the then European Jewish population and was done so in a way never before seen or replicated in history?  Yeah, members of this administration are going to need to flee to Argentina the moment they leave office. Someone have some hate in their heart? Cmon, man. Why does it always have to be like this? Bush, Obama, Nixon, lbj, etc..  all people, the US citizens voted for? > Not all SS/Germans were bad, I had a great uncle in the SS that felt he should write a letter directly to Hitler telling him there were issues with the camps; he died in the gas chamber for his efforts.      Having read several scholarly works on the SS and worked in Bundesarchiv with SS records, I would say that the above story is completely unbelievable for many reasons.   First, such a case would have been well known since it would have passed Himmler personally without doubt. Secondly, I find it impossible to believe that Himmler would have allowed any member of the SS to be gassed. Shot, certainly, or being forced into front line action until they died, yes. But not gassed. Himmler was in total control of the SS penal system and very sensitive to under which forms his personal was punished.    So while your great uncle may have died while being a member of the SS, his real fate is most likely another one than the one you have been told.     If you know some personal details like full name, perhaps birth date or place of birth, you may be able to find his SS service records in the Bundesarchiv. While the records are far from complete, and often sometimes very brief, you may be lucky.  The SS weren't just your run of the mill Wehrmacht. The fact your Uncle was in the SS means you shouldn't be defending him at all and strike him from your family tree permanently.  Of course not all of them were bad, but when you're part of a system run by nuts like the Nazis, well...  New Slayer song It's actually Auschwitz-Birkenau complex. Auschwitz was built first, and was more or less a concentration camp. Birkenau (known as Auschwitz II) however has been built with one clear purpose - extermination. That's why it's so horryfyingly massive.  Its definitely a fact. But comparing few occurrences of  pogroms by polish hand to mass murder scale of german exterminations camps is little bit exaggeration isn't it? Except that's a Polish invention. It started with someone in an US news show accidentally calling it Polish camps and some Poles making a huge fuss about it. It's rather silly actually.  There's not a single source for this that isn't Polish. Sounds like made up bullshit.  Edit: And the Polish sources it links to are just random news articles and a foreign relations paper about Poland's efforts to stop the use of the 'Polish death camps' term. None of them are even written by historians.  There is no source for the claim that there was some conspiracy, it's just butthurt Poles being butthurt.    Indeed It pisses us a lot because the only thing that those camps have to do with Poland is that they were built in there and milions of Poles died there. And to all of you people that are saying Poles were colaborating with Nazis. Yes some of them were. Not because they wanted to. It was almost always because It was the only way to keep them and their families together and alive. It was war. People do many things that they are ashamed and forced to do just to survive.  We are disgusted that in 2017 some people still believe those camps were run by Poles.  Do you have examples of this? As it was placed in Poland, isn't it correct to say it's Polish? It doest create confussion, but pure grammaticaly it's correct, right? Where are you from? This is base-level knowledge of history. What's crazy is no one tells the Jews to get over it, but they have no problem telling black people get over slavery  Is this made up? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_at_Krojanty  And yet, I live close to a concentration camp and I've given tours to tourists, you'd be suprised how many believed the guards were Poles. It's a smoke screen because they don't want to face up to they other stuff they did do and the antisemitism still present in the culture  Oh, wow. I am German and I legitimately have never heard anyone say that ""Germany suffered under the Nazis"" or some such nonsense (Well, except Neo-Nazis). What people will say is that the war was hard on the ordinary people, which is true - but that doesn't and shouldn't mean that we don't know that is WAS Germany who was responsible.   On the contrary, there are literally hundreds of documentaries (the most famous ones from Guido Knopp for the ZDF) who emphasize that the Nazis WERE German. That they were just ordinary people who did horrible things because that's what happens when people blindly believe in ideologies and follow orders.   As for the ""Polish camps"", well, most often they are referred to as ""camps in Poland"", when talking specifically about their location. TBH I didn't even consider that there might be people who don't know that the camps were run by Germans.  At least no one who went to school in Germany thinks that. Maybe we need to be more aware that not everyone learns that in school.   I can't for the life of me see an agenda in the German media to downplay the Holocaust, but if you believe there is such a thing my comment will probably not do much to convince you otherwise, I'm afraid.   Anyway, thanks for reading if you made it this far!  Can you cite some sources on these 'concerted' jewish efforts? I've never seen anyone jewish suggest that poland or polish people are to blame for the holocaust.  There are certain aspects in which some polish people did harm jews such as a few pogroms after and during the holocaust. That is not equivelant to responsability for the whole thing and no one is sying that but still you cant ignore that these things happened. It is also a fact that a lot of jewish property is now in polish hands. Not saying it was deliberatly taken but why shouldnt people be allowed to reclaim what was rightfully theirs? > There is a quite extensive effort on part of many German organizations who hope that by drawing attention to ""inherent Polish anti-semitism"" and distorting the clear optics of who ran the camps. Whether by repetitive ""accidental"" use of ""Polish death camps"" by the likes of ARD or ZDF  Can you please back that claim up with proof?   I'm not saying you are making it up but I have never seen anything like that on either ARD or ZDF and I would be shocked to find out that it is true. > Jewish sources/some - there is a deliberate and concerted effort to paint Poles as sharing the responsibility for the Holocaust among many Jewish communities and organizations in America and the major ones (ADL) are either supporting it or not doing anything to change it   As a Pole, raised Catholic, very left leaning who lost family members to the camps and what was probably ""fuck it, let's get drunk and drive around shooting poles from a truck"" there is some shared responsibility by Poles because collaborators did help.   Sure, many ended up dead or had limbs broken by the Polish underground, but it happened.  Polish police officers reported for duty under german officers. Sure, they were told to report or face the death penalty, but they reported.   And sure, a good number (~15%) of them were murdered by the germans for engaging in resistance activities (and as many as half were really in an intelligence gathering role on the side of the resistance), but some were part of some apankas (roundups of random people, usually for slave labour or extermination camps)  They refused orders to execute jews, but in some cases watched the executions that stemmed from their actions, supposedly while crying.  And arguably the exceptionally firm anti collaborative stance of the polish underground kept the granatowa policja in check.  There is a lot of disinformation about Polish involvement - most of it by historical revisionists - but also a small element of truth.  You literally want people to be fined and jailed for Holocaust denial if they say a phrase like ""the Polish concentration camp Auschwitz"", and then insist they meant ""Auschwitz, the concentration camp in Poland""?  I have a splendid idea. Let's all never discuss the holocaust again because we're terrified that the slightest misphrasing could lead to jail time.  I'm sure there are a lot of pricks trying to shift blame, but you can't have laws be that draconian. You're not helping your argument that Poland has no issues with antisemitism by writing a wall of text accusing Jews of concocting a conspiracy together with Germans to give Poland a bad rep out of greed for Polish property.  Saying this as a fellow Pole, who has personally met with many misconceptions about the camps on the part of Jewish people, but that was due to misinformation, certainly not bad will or some weird conspiracy. I can't speak for your German perspective, but your Jewish antisemetic view on how they (all of them?) blackmail Polish citizens is wrong, or at least extremely narrow minded.  Individual cases might be something worth mentioning, but you're essentially doing the exact same thing you're criticising towards the entire Jewish religion. SOME people have exploited these facts and they happen to be Jewish. Most people are good (and some of them are even Jewish) ""many Eastern European"" you say like pinpointing who exactly is impossible. But it actually is :) Lithuanians and Ukrainians helped Germans in exterminating Jews and Poles in concentration camps. Other nations didn't really collaborate with Germans on large scale. > the Poles knew full well about the camps and about the persecution of Jews and little was done to help that.  Yeah, we knew full well about the camps. We even sent the UN [a nice letter about what was going on](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plik:The_Mass_Extermination_of_Jews_in_German_Occupied.pdf) (title too subtle?). Unfortunately, the American president was more interested in the condition of Polish horses.  What exactly were the people living next to the camp supposed to do? Bum-rush it with pitchforks?   Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't they also have the largest amount of Righteous Within the Nations? (i.e: people who selflessly put themselves in risk in order to protect Jews from persecution)  Edit: I just found out it's Righteous Among the Nations. My bad.  Polish Resistance was reporting about Holocaust to Allies.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witold_Pilecki Uh, weren't the Poles like......being genocided and enslaved at the time the Nazis were running the death camps in their country? >To this day, Poland, which once upon a time had a large Jewish population, has no Jewish population  Yes, because Germans literally destroyed most of them in the death camps... And the few that were left mostly migrated to Israel between then and now.  Didn't want to reply to the rest of your post because it was so asinine. >but the Poles knew full well about the camps   Would be hard not to, seeing how many of our relatives were imprisoned in them. Wow, how did she manage to survive for that long?  Totally insane. It's why Eisenhower traveled to the camps and wanted photographs taken, for fear that people would try to deny it ever happened.  > A lot of people don't believe in the Holocaust. They believe it was a lie and wildly exaggerated.  That boggles my mind. I mean, even if (just for arguments sake) the numbers are inflated, and that 6 million people didn't die at the hands of the Nazi's. Let's say the numbers are off by 2 million. Heck, let's say they're off by 3 million. That's still 3-4 *million* people killed.  Even if they think it's ""only"" 1 million people. That's an absolutely *insane* amount of civilians to be killed. Like an unfathomable amount. The systematic killing of millions of people on an industrial-level scale.   I just can't imagine people denying the holocaust happened, regardless. It's such an incredibly dark period in human history. Yes. I know.  That's insane.  That would have to be one fantastic lie indeed.  They would have to fabricate the Nuremberg trials with actors, who were apparently so devoted to the cause as to be executed on camera, somehow got all those soldiers who discovered the camps and liberated the Jews to lie in unison.  Fabricated all the photos of the camps, the bodies in the mass graves, fabricated thousands of stories of survivors.  This would have to be the most masterfully orchestrated deception of all time to get that many stories straight. Wasn't that the subject of his PhD thesis? Palestinian authorities have never been an ally of jews, they were hanging out with Hitler before Israel came to be.

Like that bannon guy in the US. Oh wait ... Film titled 'Denial' is out (or was out in the US) it's about a famous court case where they took on a historian who was a denier.   I thought he retracted that? like he took it back and apologised?   https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/27/world/middleeast/palestinian-leader-shifts-on-holocaust.html?_r=0  Also, he isnt the only holocaust denier. The most vocal on reddit are the altright /r/altright  who deny it. Abbas hasn't spoken about it since he apologised or whatever.  It shouldn't be.   ""Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?""  -Hitler, 1939 It depends where you live.    Since we, Europeans and Americans, were directly affected by the nazi holocaust, it's normal to talk about it much more than others.    I have a Cambodgian friend, the Khmer Rouges are totally not forgotten there. I 'member.   A whole lot of people, I think, given that they've been the American Right's favorite anti-communist drum for decades. [Here you go](http://pamiec.pl/pa/form/60,Zaloga-SS-KL-Auschwitz.html) Dr. Mengele was *sort of* a medic I won't oppose that result but I also see no reason to hope for it. A person who is completely innocent of wrongdoing doesn't need to be burdened with that knowledge. It serves no purpose. I'm not sure I see the point of this response. My statement that I don't want innocent people to end up having problems because of this is in no way a comment on the tragedy of the events or their long-term effects. Yes because the grand- and great grandchildren of these monsters definitely deserve to be punished for what their ancestors did.  /s Edit. My bad. I didn't see the links on the side. Will fix that bit.  I'm having trouble getting through to a list as well. Hopefully someone comes up with one (or if the website's still not ready to go, they update it).  You're welcome, but I still haven't cross an actual list of names. Sorry. Will look again tomorrow.  I already linked to that (crossed out). I don't see names yet, though.  That list worked for me! I don't know where you're getting this from, but that's not at all what I said/meant.   Of course the children have nothing to do with it. I used ""names"" like in personal name, not family name. Like Adolf Hitler is referring to a specific person, not a family.   My family had (all fallen) its fair share of SS/Wehrmacht soldiers, too...    Of course not.   The children have nothing to do with it. I used ""names"" like in personal name, not family name. Like Adolf Hitler is referring to a specific person, not a family.   > You might like to think that some people are just evil, and that once a villain always a villain  I'm actually not thinking that. Esp. during this time things were a lot more complicated.   > a now-harmless person  Well, the first question is when does one become a ""now-harmless"" person?   I met some people from my village who were in the Wehrmacht/Waffen-SS. I actually don't know if they committed war crimes, but I can assure you there are many old germans who didn't change their view a bit. Can we really assume they are harmless now? I'm not talking about harming them, but to be weary if we should let them take for ex. a political office. Prominent examples would be Kurt Kiesinger (former Nsdap then Chancellor) or Karl Carstens (former SA, NSDAP and then president). You can find a list of ""party-members"" who played a role in post war politics on wiki. [Link](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_ehemaliger_NSDAP-Mitglieder,_die_nach_Mai_1945_politisch_t%C3%A4tig_waren). If they have a political office they can do a lot of (political) damage. And yes I'm fully aware that the situation changed since '45.    The second question is if there is any prescription for the committed crime?   We have to ask our self if a SS-Soldier who shot prisoners of war or was on a watchtower in Birkenau should go without punishment if the crime happened a long time ago. If so, how long ago? Shouldn't he be punished even if he's now harmless?   To clearify: I'm not talking about attacking them or something, but about legal steps to investigate the crimes and will (perhaps) lead to a *legal* punishment.  Yea statute of limitations exists for a reason.  Upon seeing the title of this post the first thing that came to my mind was ""this will likely incite witch hunts"". Why do you think members of the SS should get the benefit of the doubt on ""reform""? The only reason they are now harmless is they dont have the backing to do it.  None, because that's not what I meant.   Of course the children have nothing to do with it. I used ""names"" like in personal name, not family name. Like Adolf Hitler is referring to a specific person, not a family.   My family had (all fallen) its fair share of SS/Wehrmacht soldiers, too...    Swept under the rug?  You've clearly never been to Germany, spoke to a German, or have learned a thing about German culture.  The facts of the Second World War is taught in schools and the country recognizes what occurred in its past. There are memorials throughout the country, and the internment camps are open to visit. I've only been to Dachau, but the aura of the place clings to your soul, and the visitors (many German) shared this sentiment. It's hard to describe, but the moment you step into the grounds, you're overcome with this feeling of complete depression, and the smell is hard to describe. you have no idea what you're talking about. would be hard to find a country that has looked their historic past longer in the eyes than germany. It's probably true of almost all people being greedy. They shouldn't benefit from the wealth they were able to get out of the situation. Obviously, nothing can be done about it, in a practical sense; however it is worth mentioning. I just asked my father about this- he mentioned that my grandmother manned searchlights during the War. I believe he is talking about the mandatory Reichsarbeitsdienst that came during WW2.   My grandfather was in the army (he was considerably older than my grandmother I believe, and I'm not sure what age they married), stationed in Norway. He was conscripted.   My step-grandfather, also German, was too young for the Hitler Youth at that time, apparently.  Edit: Just for the record- it is my understanding that my grandparents were not pro-Nazi. My grandmother and grandfather were both drawn for compulsory service. I don't know how much they even knew of the wider Nazi agenda. They did not live in a major city.  Edit edit: I changed some wording to avoid receiving hate. I'm not an American...? I just see three buttons, editors note, details on prosecution procedure, and sources. Am I just being an idiot here? Because I cant seem to see a list. German convicts yay i got a reply You say that now, but how high does the death toll need to get before you realize the US judicial system are the modern day nazis? They kill more US civilians than every terrorist group put together (even if we start the count the morning of 9/11), they have more active slave camps than any other country in the world, and they torture not only enemies, but their own civilians. That's exactly how you get your name on a list like this. Defending these scumbags is an insult to any decent human being, regardless of if they were affected by the holocaust. No, the german SS members were pretty much all scum. Maybe you had some Wehrmacht soldiers who werent *that* into the whole Nazi stuff(can be debated), but the SS? Nah. The point is.... There are people on this list of 9000 who may have disagreed with it, and maybe even died for that belief. His Uncle deserved death for being in the SS alone. My gods the fucking wehraboo apologism going on.  German efficiency. Yeah, that's what I meant, sorry if I phrased it poorly. Of course the scale is not comparable, these were small time murderers, and those were big time murderers. Either way, it doesn't diminish from their blame. Considering my family's origin, I'm lucky to be alive.   But I didn't compare. I countered the claim that 'the issue of whether the Polish held pogroms is a matter of historical debate'.    Please, read before commenting. While its undeniable that many Poles were forced into collaboration with the Nazi war-machine, its equally unquestionable that anti-semitism has deep roots throughout Eastern Europe. The Kielce Pogrom, just as an example, took place in 1946 when there were no Nazis left to blame. 42 Jewish refugees were butchered at the hands of Polish police, steel mill workers, and normal citizens. That's barbarism and denying that episodes like the aforementioned had anything to do with regretfully popular sentiments (even post-WW2) is an insult not only to the victims but also to the immeasurably courageous Polish Resistance. Well at least one SS man must have been of Polish origins and had a Polish surname.   Checkmate all concentration/death camps were run by Poles.    Also disgusted not disguised. [The Ministry of Fereign Affairs maintains a list.](http://www.msz.gov.pl/en/foreign_policy/against_polish_camps/)  The last occurrence was a week ago. Well, then Guantanamo Bay is Cuban Prison Camp, by definition of yours. The discussion isn't about grammar.  Quite a bit of time difference there. There are still people alive who experienced the holocaust. Slavery ended quite a while ago. What Americans should focus more on however is segregation in society that only officially ended 50 years ago. Modern day America still struggles with the effects of this to this day.  How is that relevant in *any* way? And who's ""they"" [have no problem telling...]? And there's barely any native Americans left to talk about how they were essentially genocided, and the Armenians that have the Turkish state denying any wrongdoing against them.... Oh no, it's not made up.  Did you read the article though?  > The incident became notable as reporters visiting the site soon after saw the dead bodies of horses and cavalrymen which led to false reports of Polish cavalry attacking German tanks. Nazi propaganda took advantage of this, suggesting that the Poles attacked intentionally, believing that the Germans still had the dummy tanks the Versailles treaty restrictions had permitted them.    No, it's because it's an insult to those who gave their lives hiding Jews who had been present in their society for hundreds of years. If you want pogroms, anti-semitism and collaboration go further east. Wait, wasn't it Angela Merkel herself who said something of this sort not that long ago? Note that it isn't 100% false. Like I always said Nazis did delegalize SPD and KPD for a reason. Even if in the next decade NSDAP managed to somehow bamboozle the general public into supporting their ideas and the war initially there were people who were beaten (often literally) into submission. The first camps began in Germany years before the war IIRC.  And then you have to add the 50years of indoctrination in the DDR - old Ossies have the most hate towards Poland as well as the highest resentment against being bunched up with ""Nazi"" Wessies.  The point is that it isn't some grand conspiracy to rewrite history. Like I said it is about specific political interests using this information *cynically* to stir up outrage the same way you see CNN/Fox/MSNBC or... reddit stirring up outrage, editing videos, pushing narratives. If you want to show Poles as xenophobic and anti-German all you need to do is make such statements a couple of times and a large portion of society in Poland will either be outraged or openly foaming at the mouth.  The problem is that it is a terrible thing to say. For example I remember what Polenwitze ( Wie nennt ein Pole seinen Sohn)  made me feel like in the 90s  but they were very often and sadly true and you can be angry about it but it's not like they are baseless. However to even indicate that Poland had anything to do with the camps... that's a blow below the belt.  And whoever is allowing those ""Polnische Vernichtungslager"" or ""Konzentrationslager"" knows that it will work better than a stupid rude joke. After the fall of Nazism, the wartime alliances ended and the Cold War began. Numerous war criminals, protected by chancellor Konrad Adenauer, joined domestic counter-intelligence in order to spy on the Soviet agents within the American-occupied zone. The United States Army turned to Reinhard Gehlen previously in the Wehrmacht for assistance. The West German intelligence formed Agency 114 (German: Dienststelle 114) within the Gehlen Organization; headed by Alfred Benzinger (a Nazi Abwehrpolizei), who in 1956 launched a coordinated action to move the blame away from the war criminals under various investigations. Benzinger adopted the deliberately ambiguous, loaded phrase ""Polish death camps"" in the mid 1960s in order to suggest, contrarily to the facts, that Poles, not Germans, were responsible for the mass genocide during World War II.  At the height of the Cold War, the clandestine Agency 114 had been merged into the BND, the successor of the Gehlen Org. It was located in Karlsruhe and the Zimmerle & Co. which served as the front, ostensibly specializing in roller blinds. Aside from Soviet counter-intelligence activities, the agency also began monitoring domestic leftists and pacifists. Alfred Benzinger, a well-experienced former officer of the secret Nazi military police Geheime Feldpolizei remained in charge. Among the former Nazis who also worked in the agency were: Konrad Fiebig, and Walter Kurreck. It was Benzinger who coordinated the action to propagate a deceitful term ""Polish Concentration Camps"" in popular media. The efforts are not to blame Poles for the holocaust but to slowly change the narrative in such a way that Poland resembles a willing collaborator because of the deeply rooted Polish anti-semitism. It is very subtle because what it hopes to achieve is to muddle up the distinction between ethnic tensions which resulted in pogroms which were caused by Russia and occured on Russian-occupied territory and the Holocaust in which Poland did its best to resist and fight it.  This also gets more complicated with the political division in Poland because the people responsible for the pogroms would lean Catholic/conservative while the people bashing them, apologizing for it etc tend to lean atheist/leftist. This is best exemplified with Jedwabne where a leftist (post-communist) president apologized *deliberately* in a provocative manner (as part of the internal in-fighting) and there was plenty of outrage from conservative Poles who did not want to be included in an apology for something they did not do.  Add on top of that a lot of the tensions came from Jews opposing Polish independence and many Jews having positions in communist *bezpyeka*...  It's complicated and the fact that some Bolshevik criminals have been protected by Israel from extradition certainly does not help Poles to introspect about their painful history. It's difficult to accept some historic blame if the people doing the blaming protect a murderer who killed your family.   But that's Holocaust industry in action - using a tragedy to bait people against each other so that you can use the opportunity for your own benefit.  There is another issue that is quite similar in nature - Vohlynian massacre - that is going in eerily similar way between Ukraine and Poland. The Polish-Jewish relations are simialr to what race relations in America are with one side blaming the other, lost causers and white apologists clashing with white guilt snowflakes etc.  >It is also a fact that a lot of jewish property is now in polish hands. Not saying it was deliberatly taken but why shouldnt people be allowed to reclaim what was rightfully theirs?  That's not as simple as you think. There's a legal concept called usucaption which means that if you use something for a number of years then you acquire a right to ownership. The properties were nationalized in 1945 based on [this law](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dekret_Bieruta) - sorry you have to translate it, no English entry - and for the next 45 years people lived there as if it was state property. Then 1989 came and the legal mess allowed for many of the properties to be re-privatized.. only people lived there as if it was ""theirs"" and probably would buy it if there was a way to do it under communism. Unfortunately after communism collapsed the new Polish state was both poor and in need of international political support... and guess who is  very influential  in the international community and who incidentally immediately jumped at the opportunity to get the properties before usucaption could be put into effect.  So it's not as clear whether it is ""rightfully theirs"" because with the exception of several public buildings many of those ""rightful"" properties are expropriating people who lose their homes due to a glitch in the law.   On top of that I don't think that any one individual residing in Israel should have the right to claim those properties (since they got a state for free) and any one individual living in the US shouldn't try it out of pure decency.  So it's not as clear as the ""rightful owners"" make it seem. Also the same law applies to many Poles - there were plenty of Polish owners who lost their wealth to communists and they have to wait for reprivatization. It is not fair if Jewish owners get to benefit from external pressure to push their cases to the top of the list.  In any case I think this whole thing is a scam. If usucaption had been in effect those people would have no title now. My family lost a lot of land in the east due to similar events and I do not complain. It's two generations of people ffs!    I think they should.  Another clear cut example is the Palestinian families who were chased from their homes by extreme-right-wing Zionist terror organisations Irgun and the Stern Gang during the Zionist seizure of Palestine in 1947 and who, to this day, still have the keys to the homes in cities such as Jaffa that the vicious regimes which descended from Irgun and the Stern Gang (eg Likud) refuse to even let them return to, let alone reclaim..    To be honest it's only anecdotal from my side but from family members I've heard many stories that support that. Besides accusations that Polish people actually ran the death camps more often you hear blame that Poland allowed concentration camps and completely ignores the fact that Poland was violently invaded an de facto became Germany. It also completely ignores the polish underground resistance that sheltered Jews and fought to save as many as they could.  Well, there is this [one case](https://www.zdf.de/doku-wissen/richtigstellung-tendera-102.html) I know of.   Edit: I don't think that there has been an agenda behind it though https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Polish_death_camp%22_controversy  http://www.tagesspiegel.de/medien/polnische-konzentrationslager-zdf-akzeptiert-gerichtsentscheidung-und-wird-sich-oeffentlich-entschuldigen/19172706.html  The most recent example. It is repeated all to often ""innocuously"" which is why so many people think it is deliberate in the sense that nobody in the organizations I mentioned makes sure that it is properly identified as a German camp. They do whenever German-Israeli relations are concerned and tread as if on glass. They do not care if they offend Poles.   I respect your opinion and all that, but I seriously don't understand your logic.   ""Ya they were threatened under pain of death, but so what""  Do you really truly believe that you'd rather die than follow orders?  People like to think they would, but when it actually happens and you're faced with the fact that you're life is going to be ended, there is no coming back, nobody is going to come in at the last second and save you, and even if you're the most fervent believer I guarantee you'll start to have that gnawing little doubt about god, souls, the meaning of life, and that maybe there is no more, maybe when we die we're just dead. No heaven. No hell. Nothing.  You'll accept all that, just so whatever you refused to do will end up most likely getting done anyway by someone who couldn't let then and there be their end?  It's a romantic notion, but I doubt it. I don't know you, I'm not saying you're a bad person at all, it's just that's the truth of the matter and I can't sit here and point fingers at someone for not giving up their life when I do not believe I would be able to do the same.   Every time I think about the holocaust, all I can think about it how they're may have been those who were sociopathic, sadistic, psychopathic, or whatever that did take pleasure in what happened, or just felt nothing. But those kind of people are the exception, not the rule. There's just no way that the vast majority of the people who knew what was going on and still took part were all psychopaths, they must've been ""normal people"" at some point at least. Like what flips that switch? What takes a regular person, going to the office, eating dinner with the family(or whatever, ""normal things""), and then a few years later they're overseeing the systematic extermination of millions of other people.  It fucking blows my mind.       And I know I'm way oversimplifying here but you get the point.  There were collaborators in the Jewish communities. There were Jews who sold out other Jews and nobody is claiming Jews are responsible for the Holocaust.   The Holocaust was a **policy  of the German government**  and notice that not every German can be blamed for it. I quite specifically state whenever this subject comes up that every single pro-Communist German and majority of SPD supporters (see how many Germans that includes by 1932) can claim innocence here.  Yet still as far as German statehood is concerned Holocaust was ""German"" even though NSDAP had (initially) only full support of 30-40% Germans.    The Holocaust has **never** been the policy of Polish government although some efforts to ""Polonize"" were present and they were pushed by Catholic nationalists many of whom were quite blatant anti-semites.   The difference between having xenophobic criminals and collaborators within your society and having your government institute a genocide is **fundamental** and the two need to be kept separate no matter how much right-wingers in Israel want to include all persecution of Jews throughout history as ""holocaust"".  Do Poles need to look back at their history and consider the instances of rampant anti-semitism? Of course!  Do Jews need to consider that they are not as innocent as they want to claim... they should (good luck there). But that is not the same as  taking part of the responsibility in the Holocaust. Ethnic tensions in Poland have a long history and they start with *Russia* and the influx of *Russian* Jews who were forbidden from settling in Russia due to [Pale of Settlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_of_Settlement). The explosion of tension started whenever Poles wanted to break away from Russia and Russian Jews would work against it. But that's different, it has almost exclusively a political undertone and often you would have ""good Jews"" and ""bad Jews"" based on who they supported (Poland or Russia/Soviet Union).  The Holocaust is, has been and will be German and we must never forget that. Period. If anyone tries to make it seem different is a despicable individual (and Trump-lover...is there a worse insult on reddit these days?).   I am opposed to the idea of Holocaust denial being penalized. Instead I want an education effort to be more comprehensive and less politicized ...but I am an idealist and I like both freedom of speech and growing as a society.  Yad Vashem recently criticized the plans for the law as ""Holocaust denial"" because they would put in danger blaming Poles for controversial episodes like Jedwabne. Since it is debatable whether that indeed was part of the Holocaust (inspired by Germans) or whether it was just a regular pogrom (inspired by ethnic tensions) I think that *this specific case* of denying that death camps were *only German* qualifies as Holocaust denial.  I think that it is very important to *always* add ""German""  to the phrase ""concentration camp in Poland"" because this shows exactly what happened in a single sentence. Germany invaded and occupied Poland and murdered millions of people who lived there based on their ethnicity.   Speaking the truth is never wrong and people who are embarassed of speaking the truth even when it has nothing to do with them have a problem.  >I have a splendid idea. Let's all never discuss the holocaust again because we're terrified that the slightest misphrasing could lead to jail time.  Fines. Just the same way many countries punish ""slightest misphrasing"" if it encroaches on *Jewish* interest.  Either we punish *all* lies or we don't punish anything. It is unacceptable that one group of people gets to blackmail and terrorize others with it and nobody else does.  The problem  is that it is constantly used for politics but I said what I think about it at the very beginning of my comment. Ok lets say that Jews made REALLY something worse they wiped out whole real country... oh wait. Educate yourself.  [New Antisemitism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_antisemitism)  That's an actual ""Jewish conspiracy"" and it is very much tied to specific conservative-leaning groups of Jews in Israel, America and Europe.  Anti-Defamation League is the leading organization here promoting a ridiculously biased understanding of what anti-semitism is. For example you oppose re-privatization of Jewish properties nationalized *seventy years ago* because you are a leftist - you are an anti-semite. You oppose supporting Israeli occupation of the West Bank because you are a pacifist and stick to 1947 solution - you are an anti-semite. You oppose people like Sheldon Adelson because of their ties to Israel influencing American politics against America's interest - you are an anti-semite. I remember how the left-leaning magazine ""Polityka"" ran an ADL-sponsored article with a test to see if you are an anti-semite and it was impossible to *not* be one if you had any critical opinion of Jewish/Israeli interest for *whatever* reason.  What do you think this is if not a conspiracy to use slander and blackmail to push for your political and material interest. It has **nothing** to do with genuine anti-semitism or the very peculiar anti-semitism in Poland which has mostly political roots and dated to Russian Jews opposing Polish independence under Russian occupation (1795-1918).    Thank your for providing evidence for my claims - ADL-inspired mentality in action. i care Well, even Holland had their homebred Nazis at that time.  People often fail to realize that the mechanics that enabled the rise of Nazi Germany are present in every single country to this day. > Other nations didn't really collaborate with Germans on large scale.  [They did not?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waffen-SS_foreign_volunteers_and_conscripts) The Poles also committed heinous pogroms before the nazis and Hitlers rise to the power...they also committed pogroms after the end of the war. Now...we could get into a debate about whether those actions were Polish in nature or communist/Soviet in nature...either way, there is no disputing the history of anti semitism in Poland.  That is correct. In fact, I wouldnt be here today if it wasnt for one of those people. My family comes from Vilna which was once the Jewish capitol of the world. Once the war broke out, my great grandma had to give my grandma and great aunt to christian families while she and my great grandfather went into hiding in the forest. My grandma was younger so she pretended to be one of the families children. My great aunt was a bit older so she pretended to be a maid of sorts. They both had fake baptism papers. After the war, my great grandma went back to get them and the family watching my grandma didnt want to give her up. Ive also been told my greant grandma looked so disheveled after the war that my grandma ran away from her when she first saw her.   With all of that said, Poland is still very anti semitic and Lithuania has no more Jews. The last time I was in Poland, I went to the Jewish quarter in Krakow and saw several swastikas sprayed on the walls.  What is the point of this post? I dont accuse all Poles or even a majority of Poles of being complicit...obviously there were thousands and thousands who did their best to help the Jews and fight the nazis. With that said, Poland has been and continues to be a very anti semitic society.   I dont feel like digging too much so Ill just give you the first study I found on google.   http://forward.com/news/world/191155/poland-poll-reveals-stubborn-anti-semitism-amid-je/ um yes they were, 2 million poles died in camps, and many more from hands of German soldiers. Germans had plan to kill all poles:  ""All Poles"", Heinrich Himmler swore, ""will disappear from the world"".  The Holocaust was just the straw that broke the camels back. There were roughly 3 million Jews in Poland pre WWII...Jews who had been persecuted in Polish society long before the nazis and were persecuted when they tried to return home after the war.   What is asinine is for you to pretend like anti semitism never existed in Poland and doesnt exist today.  It was not easy.  When a train arrived the selection took place. Weak ones were separated from strong individuals and sent under the shower. There was no shower but gas chambers.  So a lot of those who arrived didn't survive half an hour.   But those who did, lived under horrible conditions working in a factory. Patton loaded thousands of germans onto busses and made them walk the camps so they could never say that the allies were lieing about it.  I still can't believe the piles and piles of bodies. It's one thing to see mass graves of civilians killed in battle. It's still sad, but it's comprehensible. Seeing mass graves of civilians systematically killed in camps is something else. Broader definitions include the two to three million Soviet POWs who died as a result of mistreatment due to Nazi racial policies, two million non-Jewish ethnic Poles who died due to the conditions of Nazi occupation, 90,000220,000 Romani, 270,000 mentally and physically disabled killed in Germany's eugenics program, 80,000200,000 Freemasons, 20,00025,000 Slovenes, 5,00015,000 homosexuals, 2,5005,000 Jehovah's Witnesses and 7,000 Spanish Republicans, bringing the death toll to around 11 million You mean like the Armenian genocide? When did he deny the holocaust? He wrote a whole book denying the holocaust. It's not like he was drunk and misspoke. No, it definitely shouldn't be. And most historians today do not at all think that the government engineered the famine. Did collectivization exacerbate it? Absolutely. However, it's ridiculous to engineer a famine when you're in the process of industrialization and need all the food you can get. Thanks. Turns out my family worked at Buchenwald not Auschwitz. Yea, I just looked as well and no list. Any idea when it will be publicly available?  Yeah I just noticed. I'll be looking as well. I see 8502 names so far. Apologies if it came off that way, I was't trying to be condescending or correct you. ""Name"" is a fairly ambiguous term, I was just trying to add to your comment. The issues you mention may have been relevant some decades ago but today they are simply not relevant anymore in practice. They surely are still interesting in theory and have to be discussed somewhat. But as of 2017 nobody who could have any involvement in the SS would seriously consider taking a political office. They are older than 90 years today. There's usually not a statute of limitations for murder. A lot of counties don't have statute of limitations at all so that argument doesn't really work in regards to international affairs.  Maybe you need to educate yourself in what actually happened to the Nazis after the war then you will have more educated thoughts come to your mind first than ""OMG there will be a mob with pitchforks and everything because people are all dumb except me. Luck for those poor old nazis I am smart and liberal enough to to go online and tut tut."" It's not the Holocaust which was swept under the rug but the perpetrators. This was actually an ally policy to keep Germany on side during the cold war. For instance all life sentences from the Nuremburg trials were converted to 5 years in prison. Out of 3000 known SS murderers only 400 were ever tried at all. > rmany, spoke to a German, or hav  It was swept under the rug, they hired former SS and other collaborators to run the country, you're clearly full of sh** And certainly during wartime when you can plunder with impunity. Nothing can be done now but after the war some companies where dissolved/nationalized/restructured/forced to change product lines due to their more or less willing participation with either the Nazi government or one of their occupied puppets. Are you? Wrong link, sorry.   The actual list of names is still in Polish and doesn't seem to be publicly out, yet. It takes a while to load up, but [here it is](http://www.pamiec.pl/pa/form/60,Zaloga-SS-KL-Auschwitz.html).  Do you know any people from Armenia, Russia, China, Cambodia or Rwanda? I do, I know a lot of Rwandans, and they absolutely talk about this. Their genocide is so recent that it's very likely that if you go to Rwanda you'll see quite a few people, not even old, with missing limbs. Rwandans know it's important to not let the world forget about it. But the issue with that is, there aren't that many Tutsi compared to Jews, and it took place in one small country rather than across the most globally successful and culturally impactful continent on earth, so it's hard to draw as much attention to it. They do within their own circles, the Jewish people just have the lead in terms of resources. It's not like this is *all* they ever talk about.  That's a list of Jewish deaths alone and doesn't account for the systemic killing of Slavs, homosexuals, prisoners of war, among others.  Here  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1481975/The-Holocaust-death-toll.html Again, that's why we have to use bits like ""not all"" and ""pretty much all"". We can't speak for all the people who are long gone. There may very well have been dissenters.  No one's saying anything like ""all of them were in on it"" or anything.  Isn't over-staffing a sign of inefficiency? Germany bureaucracy  Auschwitz consisted of Auschwitz I (the original camp), Auschwitz IIBirkenau (a combination concentration/extermination camp), Auschwitz IIIMonowitz (a labor camp to staff an IG Farben factory), and 45 satellite camps (some serving various function mostly slave labour from farming to mining to factory work. 28 of these served corporations involved in the armaments industry. Including Siemens and IG Farben).  RE: Size It  occupied  approximately a further 40 square kilometres (the so- called  Interessengebiet    zone  of  interest), extending around Auschwitz I and  Auschwitz  II-Birkenau.  Furthermore,  dozens  of  sub-camps,  some  of  which  were  located  at  a  considerable  distance  from  the  main  camp, were subject to Auschwitz administration.   The fleeing Nazis attempted to destroy Auschwitz-Birkenau - dismantled crematoriums (known as Krema), destroyed written records. Crematoria I & II were ""dismantled"" with dynamite. Himmler ordered no prisoner left alive to be found. Where they could they attempted to burn the rest.  Upon liberation, approx. 600 were found dead on the ground of Birkenau alone various causes including machine gunned to death.  Elsewhere, in pure extermination camps, often semi-temporary sites the destruction was more complete and gives us a clear understanding that the Germans knew exactly the evil of what they were doing and that their goal was to make it as if it had never happened.    I understood it as such and was supportive of your claim. Lots of Poles (And Austrians and Bosnians) are in plain denial of collaboration/participation in nazi Genocide unlike Belgium, Netherland, Italy and France who admitted it at various levels of responsabilities. Okay now i wont overthink what you write, and instead of reading between lines (which you mentioned) ill just simply ask. In what order would you rank these nations regarding level of wrong done to Jews: Germany, Poland, Russia, England, France, USA, Lithuania, Ukraine. You can assign number representing weight if placing them in order would place 2 countries too close to each other. Hey I'm not saying that Poles are all innocent and were only victims. I agree that there were horrible acts of violence done by us. 

But i thought this topic is about holocaust. I'm refering ONLY to this exact thread. You can say we have done a lot of evil but DO NOT count holocaust into one of those things. That's all i wanted to say :) 
In ""today's Language"" you can say that I and many other Poles are triggered every time we see threads like this are still a thing in 2017.  It's called war, people often collaborate with occupiers for personal gain. Pretty sure AK executed people who sold Jews out anyway. If you look overall at Poland vs other occupied countries it really shines as a beacon of fuck you to the nazis. Besides allowing Germans to occupy Czechoslovakia, official government has never in any capacity collaborated with the Germans. There were no Polish SS divisions, although there were many from countries with far smaller populations such as Croatia, Lithuania,  Latvia or Romania. Polish citizens also hold the highest number of righteous among the nations, I think they have about a a quarter of all the awarded medals.   If this is a binary issue for you then yes, Poland/Polish citizens were complicit in helping exterminate those targeted by nazis including themselves. Every country was, the only exceptions I can think of is something like Monaco or Thailand. I guess they definitely never had a single instance of their subjects aiding nazis in anyway whatsoever.      As for antisemitism that was and still is rife everywhere, just look at Stalin's Jewish trails post WWII. My granda was on the train back to Europe from gulag, other prisoners were forcing you to show you foreskin and then depending on lack or possession of it throwing you out of the train. Most people/nations hate/envy Jews, just rarely taking it to genocidal level. Mostly because, well they are never poor or people assume that they control media/world. The reason there was so many of them in Poland in the first place was that they came there after being kicked out from Spain. Apparently Poland was pretty tolerant back in the day. I guess you agree with my post and this is just an irony? 
Kinda hard to tell nowadays where is the line :)
And sorry for language mistakes. I learned It mostly from games and reddit :D Ok, that is dishartening.   edit: now that ive read through some of these, most are taking issue withe articles stating that the death camps were in poland. Forcing corrections such as 'the national socialist german camps in occupied poland' is a bit of a strech. no one blamed poland by stating that the camps were there. The Native Americans died from exposure to disease. There was warring back and forth of course, but you can't really blame anyone for Native immune systems.   And small pox blankets are bullshit. They didn't even have germ theory. Maybe my teacher was just really good but he never told us they charged at tanks, that's what I should have said.  He said they were caught in battles that involved tanks and the Polish Military still had people on horseback and used this as the example of how unprepared nations were for the German Blitzkrieg.   This would have been..oh god like 15 years ago.  He was of Ukrainian descent so maybe he just had a bit more knowledge on WW2 than the average Canadian high school social teacher. > Polenwitze  What is ""Polenwitze""? Why are you pasting poorly sourced Wikipedia articles? You didn't provide any sources and your whole argument again reeks of antisemitism. No sympathy for your countrymen whos community was decimated by over 90% percent. And your comment 'very influental'...gross. Poles are still highly antisemitic and youre all proving it every time one of these threads pops up. I agree with you on that point but don't see how that has anything to do with the current discussion. Looking at your username it seems you're not very innocent.. Your family told you jews blame the poles for the holocaust to legitimize property claims? Sounds like theyre antisemitic. Thats the one accusation we do have against many polish people, antisemitism is rampant in poland and was very much so at least at the time of the war,bafore it and many years after. Some poles are still antisemitic and i can tell you that from  personal experience as a jew whos talked to many polish people. No jews ever said the polish people ran any camps however or blamed them for the holocaust. Only that many were not sad to profit from some of it. Many poles who saved jews are honored by israel as rofhtous among the nations on the other hand. One good example is janus korzac. Again, you will not see any jews saying the term 'polish death camps'. This accusation is suspicious of antisemitismitic reasoning ironicaly. Thanks for providing those links. I have to say though, the most recent example is a single incident from 2013. I'm not so sure this is really an issue as wide spread as you make it sound.    On the other hand, it might be a matter of perspective. The German word for death camp is Konzentrationslager (or KZ in short) and inherently implies that the camp was run by German Nazis. So even if I heard someone saying ""polnisches Konzentrationslager"" it might not even sound off to me because KZ already makes it clear that is was indeed run by the Germans and not the Polish. I weigh outcomes far heavier than intent, and if we're having a discussion about collaboration, it really comes down to the question ""was there collaboration?"" - the answer is yes.   Perhaps there were compelling reasons to collaborate, but that's irrelevant to the discussion.   > Do you really truly believe that you'd rather die than follow orders?  If my country's sworn allies betrayed us via direct action or inaction, I believe I'd refuse the ""orders"" coming from a nation that has been comfortable killing my people and resist, however that looks - and keep a spare bullet for myself.   > People like to think they would, but when it actually happens and you're faced with the fact that you're life is going to be ended, there is no coming back, nobody is going to come in at the last second and save you, and even if you're the most fervent believer I guarantee you'll start to have that gnawing little doubt about god, souls, the meaning of life, and that maybe there is no more, maybe when we die we're just dead. No heaven. No hell. Nothing.  I spent decades with significant suicidal ideation and attempted several times. I've travelled with ""nothing"" as my companion and have fallen into her welcoming arms. I really don't want to romanticize suicide, I'm happy where I am now and that I didn't succeed, but when it happened, I just really needed an off switch.   Would you be that different living in a country under siege? After watching your kids or partner get killed? I think most of us would be desperate for that off switch too.  > You'll accept all that, just so whatever you refused to do will end up most likely getting done anyway by someone who couldn't let then and there be their end?  Which is why collaborators must be dealt with. Having the understanding that an underground state enforces behaviour is comforting in a way.   > There's just no way that the vast majority of the people who knew what was going on and still took part were all psychopaths, they must've been ""normal people"" at some point at least.   It's the same way normal people ""cut the tall trees"" and engaged in a machete genocide. And isn't it terrifying that our species has this capacity for violence, murder and genocide? Or that it takes so little time to bring this inherent part of our nature out?  I have no idea what that means. Is this like in public school when kids made fun of you for not knowing the latest cool thing? What am I being accused of here? were talking about Eastern Europe... maybe to list should be added Latvia. Beside Latvia Lithuania and Ukraine other countries didn't really help. And keep in mind there is difference in helping in war, and in helping in extermination camps. Many countries helped Germans in war but they did it for their own country, hoping Germany would help them strengthen own country and weaken Russia. were talking about Eastern Europe... I was addressing your comment about the camps and Polish complicity in them, which is also what the original article is about. I was not talking about (nor denying) any pogroms. You seem to be redirecting. Swastikas in Krakw are 99% football related, because one main club (Cracovia) is commonly called 'Jews'. The nickname hails from before the war - as it had several Jewish players in the interwar period.  As weird as it sounds to someone foreign, the ostensibly antisemitic graffitis aren't really antisemitic, as their creators don't think about actual Jews, but about the competing football club.    It works the other way too, see:   https://www.wikipasy.pl/images/9/91/Szalik-1.jpg   http://i41.tinypic.com/do6trb.jpg 'sons of the Holy Land - born under the right star' So you're looking at history from perspective of your family member, who did actually survive the Holocaust, but it's still just an anecdotal evidence of one person, one person's opinion, one person's interpretation of facts - the person who saw it from the bottom. If you want to get some idea about what really happened, you should try to look from above, get broader overview. Have you ever tried it? Swastikas are made by a very vocal minority, usually also hooligans. It's very bad and unfortunate that this happens but the truth is most people don't care about the Jews, which arguably is a good sign. What's much more concerning it's that an influential part of the Polish Catholic Church is at least mildly anti-Semitic for reasons I can't comprehend. Interesting how this ""study"" does not quote the methods or the actual questions asked. Just as long as you can paint the entire Polish nations as antisemites, I suppose. Yes, that's my point. The poster above is apparently like ""lol, why did the Poles just sit on their hands while Hitler was shipping in and exterminating Jews in their country?"" Probably because they were an occupied people who were being slaughtered en mass, like you say. > The Holocaust was just the straw that broke the camels back.   Correct me if I am wrong, but I always had the perception that the  ""straw"" is one final, minor thing that ""breaks the camel's back"".  Correct me if I misread your intention, but did you just write that the Holocaust was one final, minor thing that sealed the fate of Polish Jews, who had suffered so much more prior to the Holocaust in the 20 years of pre-WWII Poland?  You are free to elucidate your meaning to bring it in line with what you really wanted to express, if you feel I've done you injustice with such a reading of your words.  > What is asinine is for you to pretend like anti semitism never existed in Poland and doesnt exist today.  Where did I pretend that in my post? Right, nowhere. Fact is your portrayal of Polish Jewish history is just not in line with historical facts. Educate yourself here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Jewish-Polish_history Saw somewhere awhile back where they would take captured german soldiers into a theatre room and show them footage of what had been going on in the camps. Many of the soldiers broke down while viewing the film since they didn't know that they had been fighting for such a horrible cause.   Are you sure that happened? Can't find any info on it. If those germans were your average trump supporter they would still deny what they were looking at.  edit: I'm not saying trump supporters deny the holocaust, I'm saying that no matter what trump does, his supporters will never believe it is bad. The picture of ""Last Jew of Vinnitsa"" breaks my heart every time I see it. By the time he was shot, most everyone he knew, cared about, or loved had been executed at the hands of the Nazi's. Heartbreaking. He doesn't deny it, he just failed to mention jews were among the victims. Babysteps ... one at a time. If the alt-right can do the same, apologise (even if it is fake) and admit that the Jews were wronged, i'll be happy.   My point is the person I replied to brought in Abbas, when he should have brought in the alt-right who are much more vocal regarding holocaust denial.  It's up, now  [over here](http://pamiec.pl/pa/form/60,Zaloga-SS-KL-Auschwitz.html) Aha! It's up, thanks for letting me know.  No worries!  The idea that *the Holocaust* would have a statute of limitations is rather peculiar...   Though at the same time I question the value in locking up the two or three 97 year old coots still living that participated in the Holocaust, especially those who have admitted their wrongs, reformed, and pose no threat to society. There were a lot of assumptions in that sentence for someone who knows nothing about me.  I was referring to the concept of the statute of limitations, not that it actually applies here in legality.  But, again assume you know what I meant better than I do.  I doubt debating someone with your attitude would even be productive, so beyond this I won't bother. I believe the majority of the camps were in rural areas, so there wasn't much wildlife to begin with (they had problems with concealing the smell of burning corpses to neighbours at first, but by the early 40s there wasn't much protesting you could do about it).  Anecdotally, I saw birds and whatnot, and the grass was mostly around the area. This is a good example of the Dachau that I remember from 2015: https://stevenglassman.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/dachau03.jpg  That is the foundation for the barracks of the people held there, as well as for the guards (the ones on the outskirts of this formation). It featured two or three rows of maybe 20-30 of these, I can't recall. Over 188,000 are estimated to have been incinerated in the 12 years of its operation, and its capacity felt like a few hundred - it was severely overpopulated. Ironically, after the war, it was used to house SS soldiers awaiting their trials, and native Germans who had been expelled from other countries awaiting resettlement. I can attest to the birds. They're there, but I didn't hear them. Yeah, honestly that seems strange to me. I'd expect an area with a lot of bodies buried near it to be teeming with life, since that's good for the soil. Unless something abnormal was done with them afterwards- I know sometimes the body pits were burned, and live prisoners could be tossed in as they worked around the pits. The ash might not be good for the soil in that case. Don't spread misinformation with such confidence.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials#Trial  I'm at work so I don't have the liberty of reading everything but there's plenty of individuals who were hanged or died in prison.   Do you have a source on the 400/3000 SS being tried? Just curious, I can't find numbers through my quick search Your comment history tells me all I need to know about you before I even begin to have a conversation about how narrow-minded you're being about something you don't have a modicum of exposure to, which would clearly be a waste of time. You have the internet at your fingertips - do some reading. No Also non Jews love the Holocaust. There is a certain demographic of middle aged women who will only watch documentaries about serial killers and nazis.  I feel like that's implied though.... Publishing the names with a headline like that? And the comments here, ""everyone should know who these people were... Never forget""  I just wanted to make the point that some of these may have been the good guys. At least I would like to think some of them were.... 9000 people learning of this on the job and being like ""oh this is totally okay"" would have some dire implication on human nature - something we share with them. Downvote me if you must. Over efficiency over staffing?? they were stuffed at exact number you need to kill millions ... > denial of collaboration/participation in nazi Genocide  There's a difference between ""collaboration"" and ""participation"". Were there Polish people who took active part in the Holocaust? Of course. Were there an organized effort comparable with Vichy France? The Polish Underground state did not participate in Holocaust and expended effort to alert the Western Allies about it. There's a difference between Vichy France or the Dutch volunteer SS divisions, so please don't compare the Poles to these. Never understood why people (no matter from where) are trying to deny  ""dark parts"" of their countries history. It's not like you are personally responsible for what your ancestors did, and there's no reason to be ashamed for that. Learning and accepting history is important to not repeating it.   Are we even on the same thread? I feel like I'm in a madhouse.   Why are you talking about a comparison, when I explicitly said, ""my comment was to counter the claim that the Polish did no wrong""?   Can you please, please follow the logical argument? I mean, it's not even of an abstract argument.   Here, let me dumb it down for you:    1. The issue of whether Poles held pogroms is a matter of historical debate   2. **no, it is not a matter of historical debate. here is exhibit (a) that Polish people did in fact hold pogrom(s) against Jews, in the town of Jedwabne**    In point 2, do you see any semblance of comparison between Nazi Germany and Poland? Do you see any reduction of blame of either? Do you see any ranking or any such thing? Who exactly are you protecting by this deflection of debate - the people that murdered my distant relatives?    I'm pretty sure I finished in praising the Polish resistance movement which, often to the last man, confronted German anti-partisans in brutal combat, many times fighting (and dying) alongside Polish Jews. I never once stated that Poland was obsequious to the Nazis, far from it (going as far as creating an Underground State is not the act of a fully compliant populace).    What I stated was uncontroversial. Anti-semitic sentiments are deeply entrenched in Eastern Europe. Lets not forget that the 'Protocols of the Elders of Zion' originated in the middling ranks of the Tsar's secret police and were smuggled into the rest of Europe in their backpacks after the revolution. I'm very much aware of the Righteous Among the Nations distinction and think its something that doesn't get brought up enough. Simply put, however, the Nazis did have sympathizers when their tanks rolled into Polish towns and villages (and likely retained some after they were defeated in the instance of Kielce). The defenders of Polish national pride do themselves no favors in denying that basic fact. That the number of Poles who aided Jewish neighbors far outnumber those who collaborated with the Nazis is, also, a fact. Yeah, totally I never use /s tag and i also can not be not sarcastic. Sorry. The adjective ""Polish"" does not merely have geographical connotations. You are definitely off-base with your assessment that ""forcing corrections such as 'the national socialist german camps in occupied poland' is a bit of a strech"" The treatment of native Americans in the 1800's and early 1900's; removal from land, mass murders by militias (or sometimes the US military), cultural erasure amounts to genocide  Trial of tears ring a bell? >  He said they were caught in battles that involved tanks and the Polish Military still had people on horseback and used this as the example of how unprepared nations were for the German Blitzkrieg.  Yes, most (all?) armies at the time still used cavalry for various reasons.  And yes sometimes a panzer unit would surprise a cavalry unit.  However, the initial claim was that the Poles were so stupid that they charged panzers on horseback.  This never happened, it wouldn't make any sense as a tactic. Polish jokes. My bad i should [link it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/""Polish_death_camp""_controversy) if someone didn't already.And your question should be;""Why are you pasting poorly sourced PART of Wikipedia article?[I can push you in right direction](https://networks.h-net.org/node/35008/reviews/44420/paehler-critchfield-partners-creation-men-behind-postwar-germanys) or tell you to go and /r/AskHistorians yourself.   What are you accusing me of?  I was just elaborating on your argument by providing another instance. > No jews ever said the polish people ran any camps however or blamed them for the holocaust.  A lot of them did; most recently J. T. Gross said that Poles killed more Jews than Germans, for example. Funny, as I was almost expecting that accusation. There were no property claims towards anybody we knew in our family or circle of friends. Our family didn't own anything before ww2 as they lost everything in ww1 nor did they gain anything during/after ww2. To the contrary they lost the little they rebuild again. Grandma and grandad survived but they lost so many family members to the point that my mom, aunt and I are now the last descendants.  To hear someone say broadly they were probably anti semitic and stole Jewish property is not uncommon. The term anti-semite is generously used whenever there is anything being said that could possibly throw a bad light on Jewish people. My grandfather was actually a watch maker in the suburbs of Warsaw, he had Jews in his family background few generations back. He was in fear himself. A lot of his business came from jewish clients. Our family had no reason to be anti semitic.  How many times do you think someone needs to say ""Jews deserved to be murdered"" before they get dragged before a judge? I think one time is enough. Similarly here - saying they were ""Polish"" is saying something very similar to ""Jews got what they deserved"". Now imagine a public media outlet does it. And it's the same outlet which makes a popular tv series about the war which has all Polish characters as rabid anti-semites. You'd think there's something wrong here.  Look for ""Polish death camps"" in English media. Even Obama made the mistake quite recently.  Again. It's not necessarily the ubiquity but the caliber of the statement.   The German word for death camp is *Vernichtungslager* and it means just that - an annihilation camp. Similarly *Konzentrationslager* means just that  - a concentration camp. Nobody puts ""KZ"" in the name and nobody calls the camps ""Konzentrationslager"" in English press. So no...it is exactly opposite to what you claim.    Some of the countries listed: Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Romania, Soviet Union, Yugoslavia  Totally not Eastern Europe, dude! /s Well I cant pretend to have ever heard that fact...its interesting in a weird sickening kind of way. With that said, I dont believe the marks I saw to be football related as they were in the jewish quarter and even on a wall of that famous Jewish cemetery in Krakow.  Any reason in particular you went out of your way to be this condescending? So... you seem to know, what happened? I'd like the broader view you speak of? Feels like your trying to make a point here but thought better of it and ended the comment a few lines early.   What are you even talking about? > an influential part of the Polish Catholic Church is at least mildly anti-Semitic for reasons I can't comprehend.  Poland was (by historical measures) a fairly cosmopolitan country for much of its history. The P-L commonwealth had Catholics, Orthodox, Jews, and even [Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipka_Tatars). To the extent that the Jews were singled out for hatred, it's not just some Catholic/Jewish thing.   I've read that after wars with the Tatars depopulated much of the realm, and there was a need to rebuild the economy, Jews were commonly employed as tax collectors and other estate managers (it was a reasonable career segue for many whose families had a connection to moneylending, which had historically been a disproportionately Jewish occupation). The nobles had no problem with this -- like I said, they were pretty cosmopolitan. As such, Jews were disproportionately playing the heavies who foreclosed on farms and collected taxes, etc. -- occupations that even today are accused of being open to exploitation -- I mean, let's face it, the banker whose job requires him to foreclose on the family farm is rarely portrayed as the good guy in the popular imagination even if he doesn't really have much of a choice. (And that works both ways -- when you're a banker or tax collector, and your job is to squeeze as much as you can from your tenants, the all-too-human tendency is to regard the ones who don't pay up as much as you think they should as being nothing but drunk, worthless peasants who deserve what they're getting. It makes the job easier.)   It's that added angle of ""Jews are exploiting us!"" and ""these peasants are nothing but worthless drunks!"" that made Polish Jewish/peasant relations so toxic. I've seen a fair amount of anti-semitic drivel over the last few years, but I've also read a few comments from Jews who still maintain that without the local Jewry, Poland was a nothing but a cultural wasteland of drunks and primitives. Prejudices linger. The fact that I saw them in a place that has basically zero Jews living there anymore is the saddest aspect. Imagine if there was still a thriving Jewish population. But yet, I agree that anti semitism and what I saw is perpetuated by a small but vocal minority.  Except i didnt try and paint the entire Polish nation as anti semites...I just said anti semitism was and is still rampant there. Which is true.  Europe as a whole and yes it broke the camels back. There were 3 million Polish Jews, today there are a handful. The hostility in your post and your referring to my post as asinine speaks to your belief. You are clearly trying to deny by being non responsive.  It happened at Dachau where they bused people in from Munich and I believe the Brits did it at Bergen Belsen as well. There is film footage. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMLXpNtPsp8 I didn't look into it (not the person you responded to), but Band of Brothers depicts such a scene, maybe it's based on something that happened (like most of the series).   In any case, I did find [this](http://rarehistoricalphotos.com/german-soldiers-forced-watch-footage-concentration-camps-1945/). https://youtu.be/HfWYhQgmE5Q I saw some footage of patton at a camp either during school or a documentary. I could see it playing up patton's involvement, but I know the allies documented germans touring the camps.   *found a source to substantiate my earlier post*   www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/u-s-army-and-the-holocaust www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/u-s-army-and-the-holocaust  ""General Patton was so angry at what he found at Buchenwald that he ordered the Military Police to go to Weimar, four miles away, and bring back 1,000 civilians to see what their leaders had done, to witness what some human beings could do to others. The MP's were so outraged they brought back 2,000."" Wow, what a crazy shot.   The jewish man has a look of being numb, anticipating his death or being in disbelief, and the executioner looks like his soul has fled him for being a deliverer of death. Wait, so who does he believe the victims were? Than someone who wrote a doctoral dissertation on denial? Please...LOL The Nazis tried to burn everything as they didn't want any evidence left against them. Most of the killing was done as they were losing the war so they knew the camps were likely to be found.

You just wanna deny it happened, or downplay. I would say that if you were a KZ guard, you would no longer belong to the good guys, even if you hated your work. Still blood on your hands. Well, I pointed out in the first comment/title-followup that it's more to prove to ignorant gits that the camp wasn't Polish-run or Polish-established.   Us Redditors are notorious for knee-jerk reactions, though.  It's also fair to point out that in the grand scheme of things, _some_ people in _some_ positions may not have been aware of at least the level of the atrocities, or how their specific roles contributed to them.  SS members get less benefit because they were the hand picked elite.  With that said, fuck Nazis in general, though. ber efficiency I don't know the actual number but something tells me *millions* (meaning at least 2 million) weren't killed at this one camp right? I mean it was only 6 million total wasn't it?  Ugh. Listen to me. ""Only 6 million killed."" :( ""There's a difference between ""collaboration"" and ""participation"".""  Yes, thats why I used two words.   ""There's a difference between Vichy France or the Dutch volunteer SS divisions,""  Yes thats why I said ""various levels of responsabilities"". Wich mean various personnal and/or administrative levels.   The role of Poland in Nazi gnocide is basically an ideological precursor/enabler with Russia. The country generalized the mass executions of Jews way before Nazis took power. Last pogrom in France happened ONE CENTURY before the last in Poland.   Various level of collaboration/inspiration/participation indeed. And tremendous various levels of recognition of those crimes. Im not even sure a young Croation know what an Oustachi is, and what they did, or Turkey recognize the implication in the Holocaust. The shoah one, because they are in denial of the other.  There's a difference, but collaboration is definitely a form of participation.   Edit: This is just idiotic. Imagine collaborating with bank robbers and trying to convince the cops you weren't part of the robbery. Your part is different, but it's not non existent. You participated. That's objectively true, not a matter for political debate.  I think many people don't want to learn from history. Worrying about not repeating history might mean they cannot do whatever they want to do. It's about diluting the responsibility. Germans organized all that and killed also millions of ethnic Poles with goal of extermination and enslavement the remaining few.  You ask for occupied nations marked for extermination to admit participation because of some criminals or coerced people ?  Let me remind you that Germans were forcing people also Jews into helping them, for example Jews were forced to push their brethren onto burning Bialystok synagogue, Jewish elders in Judenrte in all ghettos were in charge of selecting their own people for extermination in Auschwitz. Many many other situations like this.   That was standard German tactic, they reveled in anguish of Jews and those they deemed subhuman.  But nowadays Germans are not existent in that discussion, mythical Nazis did it all, and here you are saying that victimized nations should take responsibility. The Turks spring to mind The biggest problem with the Holocaust, honestly, is that it's kind of allowed the other countries in Europe to get a pass on *long* histories of pogroms and antisemitism. Obviously the Holocaust was far more devastating than any other Jewish persecution, but what happened still happened. When that ""dark part"" happens at the same time as when someone attempts to enslave/genocide your nation, you tend to be touchy about the way people bring it up.  Let me put it this way: imagine that whenever the subject of Holocaust shows up, some asshole shows up to remind everyone of Israeli war crimes (seen it happen EDIT: in this thread, even). Perhaps because half of it is lies.   r/holocaust jumping on ""how dare you"" horse - check;   ending argument ""im right because my relatives are Jewish and died in german concentration camps"" - check;   diversion of topic by stating "" all deaths all equal no matter if one person died or million"" - check;   personal attack  ""let me dumb it down for you"" - check;   refusing to answer 2 line question with 10 line emotional burst - check;    hereby people of internet i present You a internet dick;   advice - stay away or he'll pull you down into mud, and defeat you by having advantage of his natural habitat I would extended antisemitism to basically every country with measurable Jewish population, not just slavs or eastern europe. Where I am originally from, the city was built and created by textile industry. Each and every one of the textile overlords was Jewish. The situation was same in most Polish cities at the time. Imagine if every single industrialist in USA, like Ford, Rockefeller or Morgan were all Jewish with very few exceptions. That was situation in Poland, yeah it had antisemitism but it was largely rooted in class warfare rather then religious or cultural one. Jews were often the elite owning a disproportionate amount of wealth and land, they wouldn't have much easier under communist rule either or a French revolution equivalent.    Most states saw Jews as a foreign force that would serve themselves or their own, rather than the country of which they were citizens of. That's why often they were denied high government positions. Which is kind of true seeing how surprisingly often Jews would often spy on their home country and forward intelligence to Israel. [Eli Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Cohen) is just an example.  Rednecks do what rednecks do. If your village gets invaded and first thing you do is try to murder or snitch on the nearest Jew that really says a lot about your intelligence. I'd like to say it's just a village mentality, but antisemitism is same now as it was back then. Jews are just an easy scapegoat,  kind of like gays in Russia or EU in UK. It is still an insult to call someone a Jew in Poland,  but most people don't even know why. I guess it's mostly football type hooligans anyway.      Also by the way Poland is generally xenophobic as fuck, mostly due to its historical existential struggle.    It didn't say 'polish', it was 'in poland'. Dont twist my words. It pales in comparison to the death toll from exposure to smallpox. Whole civilizations and societies were wiped out without ever seeing one European because disease spread to all of them.  Trail of tears does! Yeah I know that was the claim I'm just saying that wasn't what I was taught in school is all. That the BND was full of former Nazis is well documented. What I can't find is a source for this claim: >It was Benzinger who coordinated the action to propagate a deceitful term ""Polish Concentration Camps"" in popular media.  /r/AskHistorians doesn't know either and the Wiki article's only source is a Polish newspaper  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/52r61g/recently_poland_has_outlawed_the_term_polish/ Another instance of things that happened in poland or between poles and jews? no you didn't. Thats what were talking about here. Throwing around examples of other ethnic cleansings has nothing to do with it. If i start talking about native americans rights and forced removal and land theft ot also wouldnt explain what happened in poland and whos responsible or deserves what at all. So why are they saying jews blame poles for the holocaust?  > How many times do you think someone needs to say ""Jews deserved to be murdered"" before they get dragged before a judge? I think one time is enough. Similarly here - saying they were ""Polish"" is saying something very similar to ""Jews got what they deserved"".      Sorry but that is such an unreasonable over the top analogy, it devalues your whole argumentation.       > The German word for death camp is Vernichtungslager and it means just that - an annihilation camp. Similarly Konzentrationslager means just that - a concentration camp. Nobody puts ""KZ"" in the name and nobody calls the camps ""Konzentrationslager"" in English press. So no...it is exactly opposite to what you claim.      Vernichtungslager and Konzentrationslager can be used somewhat interchangably but Konzentrationslager is the more common used word and it is pretty much exclusively used for the death camps under Nazi control.   In any case, I was merely making an admissing that my perspective on the issue might be different because of semantic differences in English and German. Pointing out that the English media doesn't use German words is pretty pointless in that case and in no way indicates that things are opposite of what I claim. Albania Croatia Romania Yugoslavia operated in southern Europe. They didn't really participate in core actions of 2WW and they didn't cooperate fully, if you look at number of soldiers from those countries and number of population you'll see that very small fraction actually either joined german forces or was send by government. Hungary participated in northern actions, but they didn't, like other countries from list, participate in killings. And please don't mention Soviet Union, you sound funny. Truth is Russians defeated Germans in 2 WW , they did majority of work. They died in millions while France England and USA was watching.  I think complete indifference to the actual Jews is much closer to the truth.   Similar thing with Ajax Amsterdam:   [They call themselves the ""Yid Army"" and ""Super Jews""](http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/football-why-tottenham-and-ajax-fans-have-a-jewish-identity-a-926095.html)    [Dutch police investigate 'burn the Jews' anti-Semitic chants at FC Utrect vs Ajax football match](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/dutch-police-investigate-burn-the-jews-anti-semitic-chants-at-fc-utrect-vs-ajax-football-match-10160426.html)    Did they mean *actual* Jews? No, they don't even register. Indifference. Actual antisemitic memes are used because 'Jew' is treated like a keyword. I guess if a club got an 'Armenian' nickname there would be genocide-related slogans too.  Yes, condescension of the person I was replying to. About your poor knowledge and strong bias - one most likely resulting from the earlier. I can buy that, makes perfect sense, thanks. So if you had meant Europe as a whole, then it would have been prudent to mention that you had meant Europe as a whole, because phrases like   >Jews who had been persecuted in Polish society long before the nazis and were persecuted when they tried to return home after the war.  do not exactly make it clear you had been referring to ""Europe as a whole"", instead of Poland specifically.  Additionally, as you had been told, a strong - I believe - case could be made for the Holocaust being the greater part of the reason why there were fewer Jews after the war than before it, so the war and what happened to it do not exactly - to my eyes - meet the criterion of being the ""one final, minor thing"", or the straw. Will we agree? Interesting but I couldn't find any info about Patton being involved or those Germans being forced to do it.  EDIT: Managed to dig up a bit more info: apparently there was a 'de-Nazification' programme that was put in place after the war which involved Germans being made to visit nearby concentration camps. But you specifically said Patton loaded 1000s onto buses and walked them through the camps. Do you have a source for that? https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/27/statement-president-international-holocaust-remembrance-day  Well, generally innocent victims i guess. Could mean anyone, no mention of antisemitism or jews though.  Then again he also called this https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/02/donald-trump-star-of-david-tweet-hillary-clinton#img-1 a sheriff star. So yeah, he doesn't even acknowledge it so far that he denies it. They say holocaust denial is the worst thing, it isn't. It brings controversy, it brings protests, it gets talked about and refuted.  Alt right are more dangerous to jews than Abbas.  Regardless of names, his ""facts"" are wrong. The holocaust was not the largest genocide in the history of the world. Something tells me you live in the country where the real largest genocide happened, and I'm sure you're thankful for it. What about those that refused and were shot for it, but are still on the list of people who worked there? And today ber efficiency saves people from my drinking and driving. Pretty cool. Well, the killing only stopped because the Nazi regime lost the war. The regime made far reaching plans for the extermination of upwards 45 million ""Jews and Slavs"" (including 20 million Poles) on the eastern territories alone. See ""Generalplan Ost"".      So had the Nazi regime won the war, the death camps would likely have continued their industrial scale mass murder. So yeah, Auschwitz was staffed to kill many millions. Are you serious? You're not even on the point of the debate in the first comment. You're entirely derailing the thread, and still have not responded to a single question I posed:   In point 2, do you see any semblance of comparison between Nazi Germany and Poland?    How is that so difficult? Of course I'm going to have to dumb it down for you since you've already demonstrated a complete lack of reading comprehension.    >diversion of topic by stating "" all deaths all equal no matter if one person died or million"" - check;    Please, point out to me where I've said that.    >ending argument ""im right because my relatives are Jewish and died in german concentration camps"" - check;    Same, where?    >jumping on ""how dare you"" horse - check;   Where?

They literally are all corrections to publications stating ""Polish (...) camp"" - so, don't quite know what you're talking about. Ahh I see what you mean, I misread some of your post. Yes,it seems conjectural at best,been doing some digging and author of those words has some serious issiues with providing sources for his claims.My apologies.   It involved Polish Jews aplenty; I guess that's what triggered my association of the two highly analogous events. Because they did blame them. I'm just talking from the perspective of our family and I'm repeating what my grandma told me. They just did, just like you assumed off the bat that my family tried to legitimize property claims. I know what the accepted facts were but that didn't change how people treated each other in day to day life. After the war there was a lot of animosity from Jewish people towards all poles. Many Jews that came back after the war accused everyone of being anti semitic and collaborators. If someone refuses to listen and learn they can't be convinced that water is wet. Even so... I imagine that the Dutch and the Poles would be quite offended if some footballers from another nation decided to name themselves after them, and the opposing football teams used historically-sensitive insults at them. Well that is fucked How about instead of talking out of your ass you point to examples of my ""poor knowledge.""   I still dont even know what you are talking about. The story of my family is true, as is the fact that anti semitism is rampant in Eastern Europe today just as it was before the war. So what are you taking issue with? Anyone that knows anything about Polish history know how often it's borders changed and how often control over it shifted. But sure.   I have no idea what you are getting at From jewishvirtuallibrary.org (http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/u-s-army-and-the-holocaust)  ""General Patton was so angry at what he found at Buchenwald that he ordered the Military Police to go to Weimar, four miles away, and bring back 1,000 civilians to see what their leaders had done, to witness what some human beings could do to others. The MP's were so outraged they brought back 2,000.""  Abbas pays people who kill Jews and praises them and has done so for decades (he was the financier of the munich olympics massacre). Alt right are big moronic talkers but they arent about to start blowing up buses full of Jews.  > Something tells me you live in the country where the real largest genocide happened, and I'm sure you're thankful for it.  [The Harrying of the North of 1069?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrying_of_the_North) I doubt they would appear on that list, since it seems to be a list of active personnel. Besides, [it is extremely hard](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1pozn1/as_a_member_of_the_nazi_ss_what_was_the/) to come by backed up cases of SS members being shot for refusing to take part in atrocities - typically [they would be sent to prison](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/44jndm/are_there_any_instances_of_ss_officers_being_put/czrf6cc/). I would believe the same goes for KZ guards.  I don't really understand why you care that much for KZ guards - the whole of Germany was bombed to hell and back and there were many more civilians in that country who had nothing to do with the war and who disliked the Nazis than among SS members. The power of pivoting and rebranding. Typhus and starvation killed the majority, after the alllies destroyed the supply lines.  So youre admitting that poles participated in ethnic cleansing. That is relevent, now i understand you. Very very few came back and then there were two pogroms and even fewer stayed. You still havent said what it is your family told you, you made the connectoon to property claims yourself. Where is the sympathy for their fellow countrymen who lost over 90% of their community?! There were collabirators, not people who worked in camps but those who ratted out jews in hiding or just were happy to see them gone. Not all but it did exist widely. This lack of sympathy reeks of antisemitism. Yes. Indifference can be easily mistaken for hate.  calm down lol > examples of my ""poor knowledge.""  For example, you're supporting your opinion that ""anti semitism (sic) is rampant in Eastern Europe today just as it was before the war"" with quoting grafitti you saw Krakow and ""first study you found on google"" (do you know methodology of it?). Even if this was true, your argumentation is so weak it's clear you have no idea what are you posting about. Good work.  No, but they have the ability to stir the anti semitism pot in the western world, which is how the Holocaust came about in the first place.  > Typhus and starvation killed the majority, after the alllies destroyed the supply lines.      Mass murder by deliberately starving people was part of the Nazi regime plans even before the war started.      And you are of course wrong about how the Nazi regime murdered the majority of Jews. Most where killed in ""Toteslagers"" like Treblinka, Chelmno, etc. primarily in gas chambers. They didn't starve or die by disease in those death camps, simply for the very reason they would be killed within hours of arrival in those camps.      Trying to blame the allied forces for the Holocaust is such a bizarre claim that it is obviously that you have never read a scholarly work about the second world war.    Yep, in both instances I think they did - ethnic Poles in Poland and Polish Jews in Palestine.. Did I make that connection?  > Your family told you jews blame the poles for the holocaust to legitimize property claims? Sounds like theyre antisemitic.     What exactly are you trying to dissect? I seriously don't remember anything specific they told me (grandfather passed in '89 and grandma 2 years ago) , just that there was general animosity and blame towards everybody that wasn't Jewish unless you were directly harboring Jews, and if not they would call you collaborator and anti semite not even knowing of my grandfather's background... So from what that I said do you derive a lack of sympathy? What type of sympathy should they have shown after they've been run down,  murdered and bombed themselves, to then subsequently be called anti semites... The longer I talk to you the more I understand what they meant.  When did I ever say anti Semitism is just as rampant today as it was then? You are freaking out and I am not sure why...Sorry if it offends you that Poland has a large anti Semitic population... I was worried that i was about to be hounded by a holocaust denier. So glad you're just curious and not a neo-nazi. They can and do stir the pot...but its certainly is not how the Holocaust came about in any way of looking at things.

As to whether China actually intends to fight a war against the US, I doubt it, because they can't win, especially at sea. of all the futures I don't want, it's Fallout I don't want the most. Eventually China and US will join into an economic/corporate alliance, which people will, in a spur of massive creativity, call *The Alliance*.

Revolution, browncoats, reavers, etc. [Well, we had a pretty good run](https://youtu.be/ci6tjWGRGEo?t=3190).  The chance of war has increased greatly, since China decided to turn its behaviour colonial in the South China Sea. Building militarized, artificial islands near sovereign nations far from your own borders - and then aggressively claiming bogus 'territorial rights' in the area... *that* has increased the chance for war.  China's bullying of smaller nations is destined to bloody its own nose in the near future, unless they back down. China cannot win a military conflict against a much more powerful opponent. They were likely hoping for continued relative-pacifism from the United States. The world already knows that is no longer in the cards... the 800-pound gorilla has awakened from its 8-year nap - and China knows it.  We are all in danger from the last superpower, and from China and Russia. Large, strong, ambitious nations always oppress the weak when it suits their goals... that is how civilization functions.  I find it unsurprising whenever a strong nation produces propaganda claiming its own acts of aggression are the fault of a rival. Business as usual. People should stop making a big deal out of this, The chances of war is pretty slim compared to the cold war. Trump is just being an idiot by thinking he can do foreign relations like a business and use empty threats.   Xi is well known for being a very pragmatic person so unless Trump orders the attack first, nothing will happen. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys6skqxQKMk  Unlike the propaganda China didn't built that island as an offensive stance but a defense against USA's policy to contain China with all the military bases around China. China would be in deep trouble if one of their main trade routes gets blocked by the US. Which btw, China isnt the only country that have artificial islands in the SCS, they are actually one of the latter countries that joined in. http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2056033/china-not-only-one-militarising-south-china-sea  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_containment_policy  https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2331190/us-readies-for-war-with-china-with-400-bases-of-ships-and-nukes-to-create-perfect-noose-around-superpower-rival/  Please don't tell me that they built those bases there to protect US allies from China, China usually have an second strike mentality whereby unless you attack them first they will never attack. China cares too much about their economy to waste time on war. Unlike the US; where they topple governments for influence and resources, China would rather do it peacefully by investing in the country and propping up their economy which will garner larger returns in the long run. http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/03/africa/what-africans-really-think-of-china/   All those that keep wishing for a war thinking they will easily dominate China are being extremely naive and ignorant.  USA may have the best offence with their powerful army but they are not fighting in the middle of the ocean they are fighting near China so don't underestimate China's strong defence with ""anti-access/area denial strategy (A2/AD)""   http://thediplomat.com/2013/07/americas-airsea-battle-vs-chinas-a2ad-who-wins/   It will not go well for both sides with insanely high causalities on both ends.. How many Americans are willing to make that sacrifice over an island half-way across the world to prove their hegemony...   All in all I don't think a war will happen even if Trump wants it, unless the US staff and Generals are morons... from an english only newspaper founded by an australian and a revolutionary for what became taiwan. certainly no bias at all! /s Fuck! They're playing right into Bannon and Trump's hands!  So we're getting the Sino-American war 51 years early. Good luck getting trump to declare war. People seem to forget Trump cannot declare war How people just stop seeing, hearing, listening, and posting BS bias information that only helps to stir discontent among nations of people for a fucking month!!! Then let's see how important these fuck-heads in so-called political BS authority are important or not like what happened 2 and half years ago for the US Federal Govt. Shutdown?! Cause apparently wars only happen when enough foolish and gullible people accept to join in a war - if people just simply went about their day not giving a fuck about morons who ""act"" as authority figures, everyday would be a-oh-muthafucking-kay! It would likely come from a stand off in the south China sea, but I'm more inclined to believe there will be a trade war. Too many U.S corporations are using China's practical slave-wage policies to fill the world with cheap American-designed goods. It's out of control, and America has lost over  7 million jobs to China over the past few decades. My bet is on a trade war.  War seems inevitable given the overwhelming stupidity of the human race.   It is not important. What is ,is the crowd size at the inauguration.  the more trump acts like a shit flinging baboon, the more its going to piss off other countries It's just an excuse to do what they were going to do anyway. This is only going to be felt by the nations of the SCS. It takes living in courage to prepare for peace.  It takes living in fear to prepare for war.  Live and breathe peace.   Edit: Honestly we need to flat out ignore headlines like this. This is how the notion rhat people want war is pushed in the first place.  Let's not be the mouthpieces of warmongers.

Sounds like the safest regions in the world right now are Africa and the Middle East. I wish the military enlisted men and women would simply boycott war--at least under manchild president. Oh good. I didn't want to sleep tonight either. They fucking need uncle Kenny G playing that smooth as silk saxophone piece! Over what?  What has happened to spur this?   why would they cut off their cash flow? Western business has been funding their military for decades by exploiting oppressed labor. Propaganda at best this is.  And why the hell do you want to fuck around with Asians? NONONONONONONO NO! My country is NOT gonna start another war so my friends and family can fight for a sociopathic manchild pretending to have pissing contest with a nation who knows how long their dick is and gives no fucks about whose shoulder they're hefting it onto. Lets do this The chair is against the wall. The chair is against the wall. John has a long mustache. John has a long mustache.  I don't want to set the wooorld oooon fiiiiiiiire.... Next step is for trump to deport all Chinese or hold them in camps. Best to keep them in camps so they are in a concentrated area. Australia  *Stares anxiously back and forth between his BFF and his hot girlfriend he's been courting for years* Fallout's timeline is happening!

That is obvious to people with common sense. The problem today, in my perspective, is that so many Americans are so ignorant and selfish that they think war will make things better and that it is one sided, not even remotely caring about the sever consequences to innocent people or to themselves and loved ones. I don't want war... and yet, if it does come to it, I look forward to it. Not because I want the other side to lose, because I want to finally vent out my hatred towards the true enemy, the ignorant sheep who keep putting us into this mess. I imagine the enemy invading the U.S. border overwhelming us and martial law is put into effect. And if that does happen, the trump trolls will finally get what's comming to them. Wow China really has no grasp of Trump do they?  They must think he is all show... they don't get he really is this stupid. He will go to war China, he doesn't care about consequences!  He isn't saber rattling he is a fucking buffoon, do not posture with him.   I think Trump/Putin want war with china. Now I'm picturing a bunch of Americans and Chinese saying this while pointing guns at each other in a mexican standoff. Tell that bitch to be cool! Really though. Can anyone point to specific threats the Chinese would be feeling?   All I've been hearing about from the US administration is internal policy/chaos, and quips about Russia, Iran, Israel, Mexico, etc.  EDIT: thanks everyone!  To be fair, it's pretty clear that China don't want to be the ones declaring war. Not unless Trump does something really provocative, like a travel ban or trade embargo, and in that event, they could hardly be blamed because that's basically a declaration of war anyway.  WHAT'S FONZIE LIKE!? China and Russia are allies, if we attack them and Russia aids them....we are fucked Ok China... stop being dramatic you big baby  Nuclear winter is coming. Si vis pacem para bellum MAD sure proves that wrong Off topic and not about China or trump but what if you didn't prepare for it and couldn't prevent it? ""Why are you preparing for war!?""  ""we are not preparing to fight one! It is just a preventive measure...you know in case a war breaks out""   'To secure peace, is to prepare for war' - James Hetfield. I was just reading about something like this actually:  ""Pursuit and defense of an acquisitive desire mimetically reinforces the desire of the rival/model/obstacle and vice-versa, leading to an escalation of conflict unless something external to the conflict (like a taboo or a legal authority) intercedes or unless one of the rivals submits or dies. Girard calls this mimetic escalation scandal, after the Greek wordskandalon, suggesting a trap or snare. A chief characteristic of scandal is that attempts to escape a problem only makes the problem worse (analogous to pulling against a snare). An example is the behavior of a nation-state perceived to be threatened by another nation-state. (A familiar situation?) Its defensive preparations look to its rival like aggressive provocations, which only increase the perceived threat. The rival then arms itself defensively, which is interpreted as aggression by the other side, and so on and so on. Therefore, the actions that were undertaken to secure each nation from threat have actually increased the threat and have fed a dynamic that is dangerously self-reinforcing (e.g. Europe, circa 1914.)""  source:  https://woodybelangia.com/what-is-mimetic-theory/    Einstein never said this... As a Russian, I'm fairly certain that in current political climate Russia is very likely to side with the US in this one. And if the US and Russia get together, there's not much anyone can do. New California Republic or Brotherhood of Steel? lmao i swear i thought the same thing Under budget and ahead of schedule :( DEMOCRACY IS NON NEGOTIABLE  I remember when that was never a concern with Sanders. I wouldn't get gloomy about this yet.  China seems to be using Trump's indelicate and unpracticed diplomatic skills as an excuse to provoke.  Its all a fake shit show.   Based on her foreign policy relations with russia were aparently going to sour. This was a point pushed by republicans and the point pushed for the democrats was relations with china was to sour.   Really based on these unfounded claims the major parties were simply asking 'who do you want a war with, China or Russia?'. However IIRC they weren't major talking points in the campaign. They're both warmongers. Hillary was instrumental in helping attack Libya, Syria, and supporting the coup in Ukraine. She wanted a no-fly zone in Syria, which would have caused war with Russia. http://reason.com/blog/2016/10/31/hillary-clinton-adviser-attack-iran  Just because Trump is a shit sandwich doesn't mean Hillary wouldn't have been one too. She would have, just not with China is all..  It'll be fun seeing what happens next eh? Anyone who actually believes either Trump or Hillary pulling the USA into a war with a superpower is beyond delusional. Money still fuels this world, money doesn't have much use if people are dead. The USA, Russia, China etc at the most will invade or bully smaller countries who can't defend themselves, which is what the US and Russia have done. We can have Bernie Sanders as our president and money will still power this country over ethics and reason. We haven't blown each other up in the Cold War where Americans and Communists had the most inhumane bitter hatred for each other, and we aren't going to go to war now where the tensions haven't even reach half of what it was back then. Well, yeah dude. She had *emails*. > that Hillary would get the USA into anther war  When was the US ever out of war?  It has been arming and bombing for decades now. Its just that in the last decade drones became a viable alternative so that you don't hear about death of US soldiers all that often. This election was an illusion of choice. Both were the wrong choice.  Well, she did get us into multiple proxy wars, so regardless of your political leanings that is sort of a safe bet. no no no... we would get into another war if some pms-y moody bitch got elected. had nothing to do with hillary. Well this thing with China was coming anyway. Better now than when countries are able to produce infinite bomb drones. And better just China than China plus the entire Middle East.  It is basically the opium wars all over again. This is what happens when you let trade imbalances go crazy. That's correct and there was a sound basis for that claim.  Hillary's war-mongering was Middle Eastern-based while Trump's war-mongering is Asian-based.  Hillary's views on foreign affairs resemble Henry Kissinger's largely because she has long considered him a foreign affairs mentor.  Kissinger is/was a hawk too. She spoke about going to war against Russia so when you recall being told it was literally by her.  The tensions have been rising over the past couple of years, this isn't really a result of Trump. But their statements may just be a jab at Trump b/c they may see a weakness, the weakness of not willing to go to war.  Which is ridiculous because Trump has repeatedly acknowledged that he might go to war with Iran and North Korea, and has promised a trade war with China.  first you have to watch a live documentary about how fucked up earth is, and why you have to leave for mars immediately.  P.S. the documentary runs for at least another 4-8 years From Churchill, 1901:  ""In former days, when wars arose from individual causes, from the policy of a Minister or the passion of a King, when they were fought by small regular armies of professional soldiers, and when their course was retarded by the difficulties of communication and supply, and often suspended by the winter season, it was possible to limit the liabilities of the combatants. But now, when mighty populations are impelled on each other, each individual severally embittered and inflamedwhen the resources of science and civilisation sweep away everything that might mitigate their fury, a European war can only end in the ruin of the vanquished and the scarcely less fatal commercial dislocation and exhaustion of the conquerors. Democracy is more vindictive than Cabinets. The wars of peoples will be more terrible than those of kings."" > The people will not accept war.  As if they ever have. Agreed.  If they want war so badly, let them pick up the gun.   I don't think China would be preparing for an offensive war. And to be honest, I think both sides would lose such a war. While I agree the US has an advantage, I don't want to say that an industrialized country with 4 times our population has no chance of winning, especially if we have no support from Europe. It'd be a long and bloody fight, and probably will involve a draft. I'd really rather us not be a part of that.  And that's not counting the risk of escalating into nuclear war, because China has those. Given that their economy is heavily tied to the US, and would fall drastically if there was a war, this is all bullshit reporting because.. Trump. what scares me is how well I think I'd take to scavenging and living in a subway system. As long as I have my ship and not like a leaf on the wind. Are you refering to mass effect? Because I cant wait for that timeline to happen just so I can bang a hot Asari chick It's crazy how accurate this game predicted the future. > China's bullying of smaller nations is destined to bloody its own nose in the near future, unless they back down.  I know off topic... but I can't help but think of vilifying Mexico over what is objectively a very amicable trading relationship, but has not turned over to propaganda over a widely ignorant population (regarding trading relationships).    >The chance of war has increased greatly, since China decided to turn its behaviour colonial in the South China Sea. Building militarized, artificial islands near sovereign nations far from your own borders - and then aggressively claiming bogus 'territorial rights' in the area... that has increased the chance for war.  Here is a link to an article that contains a graphic of the 400 (that's FOUR HUNDRED) US military bases that currently encircle china:  https://newint.org/features/2016/12/01/the-coming-war-on-china/  And yet China building defensive military installations in the South CHINA sea is aggressive to the US...?  >China's bullying of smaller nations  Here is a list of the governments the US has overthrown or attempted to overthrow since 1949:  https://williamblum.org/essays/read/overthrowing-other-peoples-governments-the-master-list  >Large, strong, ambitious nations  Here is a link to the wiki article on UN security council veto powers:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_veto_power  You may notice that the least frequent user of this power (by a huge margin) is China, because China does not give a shit about any country other than itself (not necessarily a good thing in itself, but China has no serious ambitions towards appropriating another country or its resources).  >I find it unsurprising whenever a strong nation produces propaganda claiming its own acts of aggression are the fault of a rival. Business as usual.  I'm actually ready to believe that this last bit is satire, because of how often even in recent history America has been caught doing this. >  China cannot win a military conflict against a much more powerful opponent. They were likely hoping for continued relative-pacifism from the United States. The world already knows that is no longer in the cards... the 800-pound gorilla has awakened from its 8-year nap - and China knows it.  Where's the punchline? The US doesn't have the will to fight anyone right now, it's too busy shooting itself the foot with a machine gun. > the 800-pound gorilla has awakened  the biggest gorilla species, Eastern gorilla, weigh from 300-450lbs.  an 800 pound gorilla needs to be threw into a fat camp You must be living under a rock the past year.  Direct claimants like Phillipines and Malaysia doesn't view Chinas as aggressive and they have given up refuting China's claims in SCS. it's a defacto victory for China, the US is wayyyy too late, everyone knows this, including China.  Phillipines told US to screw off with FOPN, and even Australia/Japan refuses to join US patrols in SCS...  That's how powerful China is. Even US allies refuse to join US FOPN patrols due to China's influence, and China hasn't even fired a single bullet. I have a question, if you think the US should go to war with China over what they are doing in the South China Sea, then do you also believe that other countries should have at least sanctioned the shit out of the US for invading Iraq? Hahaha. Yup. Always put the blame on the other guy. It's clearly all their fault. Business as usual.  > the 800-pound gorilla  is that how people see Americans now?damn, the obese problem is real I wrote this somewhere else, but I'll repost it here since I'm lazy:  China has had the Nine-Dashed Line in the South China Sea since at least 1947, before either Vietnam or the Philippines were even independent states, and I would note that this territorial claim was not challenged by the United States back then, since China was then formally recognized via the ROC government. Furthermore, China's first formal claims to the Spratley and Paracel Islands date back to the 1870s, and they successfully defended their administration of those islands from the French and the British, conducted surveys, etc. If you look up the dispute on Wikipedia, you will note that it is a proven historical fact that China considered the Spratley and Paracel Islands to be Chinese territory since the 19th century:  >1883  When the Spratlys and Paracels were surveyed by Germany in 1883, China issued protests.[9][10] 1887  The Convention Respecting the Delimitation of the Frontier Between China and Tonkin between France and the Qing Empire set the maritime boundary in the Gulf of Tonkin.[16][17][18]   >The 1887 Chinese-Vietnamese Boundary convention signed between France and China after the Sino-French War said that China was the owner of the Spratly and Paracel islands.[2][9][19]  In other words, their claim is hardly ""colonial,"" and for most of that territory, their claim is probably stronger than that of either Vietnam or the Philippines (who really only began claiming the currently disputed territories as their own in the 1970s by the absurd argument that they were terra nullius).   I'm consistently amazed at how one-sided and biased the reporting on the South China Sea issue is in the Western press. The Chinese version of the events is never presented, and instead we get sanctimonious moral indignation at Chinese ""land-grabs"" and ""bullying"" (ignoring the fact that Vietnam and the Philippines have done the same thing, albeit more incompetently). It's just terrible and unprecedented that China has ignored a (non-UN and not legally-binding) arbitration court ruling that it didn't participate in when THE most flagrant violation of international arbitration in recent history was the United States's refusal to accept the [legally-binding judgment of the ICJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua_v._United_States) that the United States had violated international law by supporting the Contra death squads and mining Nicaragua's harbors in an attempt to overthrow the Nicaraguan government--that's at least a hundred times worse than dredging sand and spraying fishing boats with water. The lop-sidedness of it all would be hilarious if it weren't so maddening. If the United States wants other countries to abide by international rulings, they should start by doing so themselves.  Oh, and I want to say something about the credibility of the PCA court ruling. I'll gloss over the obvious fact that China did not accept its validity over matters of sovereignty and refused to participate (how fair is a trial with only one party present?). The judgment not only invalidated vast swathes of EEZ from China, but also from Vietnam and the Philippines and possibly threatens French Polynesia and American Pacific territories by employing revolutionary new interpretations of maritime law (one of the reasons why Vietnam, for example, has been less than enthusiastic about what has been hailed as a huge victory in the ignorant Western media). Most hilariously, it declared that Taiping Island, the largest island in the Spratley Archipelago with a permanent population of 200 people, was merely a ""rock."" This rightfully received universal ridicule from all informed observers, and the media didn't have big bad China to accuse of propaganda, because Taiping Island is administered by Taiwan and the strongest response against this was from the Taiwanese. And lets remember as well that Trump wanted a military style inauguration ~~with missiles~~ included in the parade and military fly overs.   **Edit:** the only source for the missile claim was an unnamed source from the Huffington Post so we can guarantee thats false. my bad   But trump has said he wanted to ""[show off the military at his inauguration](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-donald-trump-came-up-with-make-america-great-again/2017/01/17/fb6acf5e-dbf7-11e6-ad42-f3375f271c9c_story.html?utm_term=.93783c02179f)"" China is also the only player that can justify big defense spending. And what right has the US military to be in that region of the world? Fallout 3 China still can bomb the shit out of Japan and South Korea, Hawaii and Guam and it is not going to be funny. Not forgetting that they have a nuclear weapon trump card. I hope the tensions decrease. To be fair, China already claimed those waters, and had done so for ages. They haven't suddenly started operating in what they see as foreign waters.  >  China cannot win a military conflict against a much more powerful opponent.  China is nuclear. That is the great equaliser.  Well said sir, well said All the article does is quote some Chinese official statement from an official website.  Try reading the article before crying about fake news. I think you're right.  I would believe they're itching to exploit that as a distraction from their own pending misdeeds. If people are apathetic toward it then maybe.  Speak like his is exactly how war is conjured.  Don't do the work of the enemy for them.   Words and intent are activators of existence.  Be careful what you help conjure.  I don't mean to be rude or anything but we should all be aware of how our individual thoughts and actions affect the whole. Apparently the leftwing believe that Trump calling Taiwan's President is so bad that China is correct to threaten war.  The leftwing has truly gone off the rails. Literally none of that is coming true and even looks like coming true. Just Scaremongering bullshit everywhere and you're delusional if you actually believe your prediction is even slightly accurate, and if you think you have the foresight to make such predictions.  What is the Russian-Chinese relationship like?  The actual Mexicans creep around in the background taking the wall down brick by brick quietly.  No ticky, no laundry. I'm pretty sure a Mexican standoff has 3 parties, not 2.  This would just be a regular standoff. Then an axe smashes a hole in the door and a head comes through ""HERE'S DONNIE"" and then all shit hits the fan. You mean Chinese saying this as we park a few carrier groups of the coast off china  Be cool Hunny Bunny! Be cool!  Trump often talked about the unfairness of Chinese-US trade relations which had upset the Chinese to a small degree but the major issues are Taiwan and the South China Sea. With Taiwan, Trump had a phone call with the Taiwanese president and generally has been much more open about Taiwan being an independent country and may consider ending the One China policy. The South China Sea issue is much more relevant though as his Secretary of State said that the US would no longer allow the Chinese to continue their island building and that further access to the islands would be denied implying a military blockade which is the main source of the recent rhetoric. The biggest threat that China is feeling at being surrounded by US allies in the First Island Chain is their current inability to field nuclear ballistic submarines in the West Pacific, as they are hemmed in by South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Philippines, et cetera. Any submarine trying to break through would be detected, thus nullifying the SSBN nuclear deterrent.  The South China Sea issue goes beyond the mere ownership of the islands. Until they have the means to operate nuclear ballistic submarines undetected in the West Pacific (e.g. by controlling Taiwan, or escorting SSBNs with fully-fledged carrier groups), the SCS serves as a critical short-term solution to complete China's nuclear triad. The construction of a submarine base on Hainan Island is no coincidence.  In other words, China critically needs to control the SCS for itself so that their sea-based nuclear deterrent has a safe, if only temporary, area to operate in. All the sovereignty bullcrap is little more than a cover story (though it is still important to preserve the legitimacy of the Chinese government by maintaining 'territorial integrity'). The real conflict here is that China needs somewhere to field their SSBNs, and for now, a Chinese-controlled SCS is the best place for that. A blockade of the South China Sea islands by the Trump administration. Since the official position of the Chinese government is that the territory is their land, that would be a declaration of war to do so. That's why former president Obama sent warships but never prevented them from making contact with the islands. Taiwan, SCS. There are bunch of stuff Trump threaten to do thst the Chinese will unquestionably view as DOW. It's a minor member of the party/military sabre-rattling to try to show off in China.  It's the very definition of pointless. The Chinese's plot; climate change? Trump's rhetoric to [build more nuclear missiles](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-tweets-apparent-call-more-us-nuclear-weapons-n699221), [the decision](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-usa-thaad-idUSKBN12Z028) to put a [THAAD missile battery near China in South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_High_Altitude_Area_Defense) which could potentially destabilize [MAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction) and [US Congress issuing a study on Russia and China's nuclear survivability](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-01-30/nuclear-strike-survival-for-russia-china-get-new-u-s-review). Not to mention other things people already covered, his threats to renounce the One China Policy and talk to forcible remove Chinese presence in the S. China Sea on disputed islands. Tillerson seems to be pushing the idea that they intend to push the Chinese off of the contested South China Sea islands they developed to act as power projection points in lieu of having more aircraft carriers. My hope is that Trump is purposefully bringing the Chinese to a boiling point. China does NOT want to fight one of its biggest trading partners that has the most advanced military and best power projection capabilities in the world. But if you push them, or anyone else really, they HAVE to push back or risk looking weak and losing legitimacy. If Trump can bring the Chinese to the sweet spot where they almost definitely have to go to war and would give almost anything for an out, he will have created enough leverage to make something big happen. And that something, if I were him, would be agreeing to redraw the lines allowing for greater Chinese power projection into the South China Sea, in exchange for them removing Kim Jong Un. The North Korean elite are turning on Un, and you better believe China has the pull to back them and pull the plug on the Kim dynasty. NK would upgrade to a plutocracy, and become a relatively sane world player, and possibly open up to more trade and capitalize on its rare earth deposits to develop. But, then again Trump might just swing on China and kick off a nuclear war. It's 50/50 really. It's going to be about the islands. China will shoot down a recon aircraft sooner or later and trump will not be disrespected like that. Even IF there was a travel ban or a partial trade embargo, how would a shooting war help China?  Once China kills a couple hundred Americans or invades Taiwan, is there ANY CHANCE that the US would LIFT such a travel ban or trade embargo for years?  With the current administration in Washington?  There will be a dance re: trade and other issues and, IMHO, both sides will come to a temporary arrangement that is likely less unfair than the current state of things.   Yet saying Mexico should do a trade war with the US isn't?  Victim blaming at it's finest.  let's hope not It is?  Well, I've been meaning to buy a new jacket. Truer words have not been spoken. The big powers, be it Rome and Pathia, or in the modern world USA and Russia(not a great power, but has nukes)/China will only remain at peace if they maintain military parity. As soon as the tips in military parity tip too much in one way or the other, some warmonger will arise and convince his side to attack.   Yeah sure if you wanna live in fear and predicate your actions on such fear.  This is one of the mental traps that perpetuates war.   The Romans preserved peace by massacring entire tribes and cities when they got out of line.  But he did pen it. In a letter to a congressman Robert Hale of Portland in December 4 1946, specifically:   >""You cannot simultaneously prevent and prepare for war. The very prevention of war requires more faith, courage and resolution than are needed to prepare for war. We must all do our share, that we may be equal to the task of peace."" lol my bad. good eye The last time the USA and Russia worked toward a common goal, WW2 ended. great leader of N.Korea will fight them.  All Hail! Why is there such an enmity between Russia and China? You're assuming the rest of the world would stand by and watch. Listen man, that's a wonderful sentinment, but as an American I am deeply suspicious of your government and frankly I don't think Russia has, ever had, or ever will have America's best interests in mind.    In this scenario I only see Russia aiding the US if they had something significant to gain or were able to back stab the US in some way. Always loved me some power armor. Idk how the NCR are not more successful.  They have the largest population, they are the only thing coming close to a real functioning state. And then these same people propped up a douchebag who rides a golden escalator to his office in an Ivory tower as The Man of the Common People.   What is the most appropriate word or phrase to describe something that is simultaneously depressing and hilarious?  They're both greedy.  The only Presidential contender who distinguished themselves by displaying high standards of integrity and sound moral/ethical judgment was Bernie Sanders. She's just as greedy. I hear you, but you know, after this election process, I've stopped saying ""x isn't going to happen. It can't happen"". Because every time I've done that, Improbable X has happened. exactly, it's posturing for domestic news fodder. wake me up when the US sets up a blockade in the SCS. ""Trump will never win the nomination""  ""Trump will never be president""  You are literally jinxing mankind's survival. Stop it. There is no reason whatsoever for China to go to war with us. It would be economic disaster for them to go to war with us. Definitely just nonsense from media to stir up more people... This really underestimates the issue: if you go around grabbing pussies, be prepared to be scratched by a few.  yeah, it's totally China who's provoking.  Also, it makes sense to be prepared for something like this.  I doubt America isn't ready for war with China. It's all fake until you realize the clown who couldn't even ignore Twitter baiting by anonymous people online while running a presidential campaign is what stands between us and international conflict.  Trump wants the same http://www.businessinsider.com/trumps-safe-zones-syria-refugees-world-war-2017-1?utm_content=buffer76a5c&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer So much fun. The Clintons were bought out by the Chinese during Bill's time in office. Sounds like Mad Dog  ""Anybody who thinks Britain and Germany would go to war over some dead Austro-Hungarian Archduke is just crazy! The global economic order has far too much to lose from a war. And major powers only bully or invade smaller countries like Serbia. This situation will never turn into a global conflagration, humans are far too rational!""~ Everybody ITT, had reddit existed in 1914.  yeah but a minor war in 2 years will almost certainly guarantee a second term... i don't think... and please correct me if I'm wrong, that America has ever voted out a war time president. I agree that total war is certainly out of the question Nobody thought Trump could possibly get elected. Then nobody thought he would follow through on his campaign promises. All that needs to happen to start a war is for the US to try and blockade the SCS. If the Chinese decide to sink it (which they could easily do with missiles from the mainland) it will be instant war. > Americans and Communists had the most inhumane bitter hatred for each other  That's an interesting comparison. Is 'Communist' a nationality or is 'American' a political philosophy? American Communists must have hated themselves! While I applaud your level headed reaction and your misplace faith in humanity's greed, You're assuming that the decision as to whether or not there is a war lies only with the U.S. I feel like you're mostly right. Plus at this stage pretty much any war between superpowers would devastate both countries since we all have enough nukes to destroy the entire planet.  I dunno...just doesn't seem realistic. I don't even think someone as dumb as trump would go after China or Russia, and I'm sure their respective leaders all feel the same way about us. I don't recall saying we weren't at war?  Just said *another*. They were both bad, but they weren't both wrong. One was a continuation of the status quo, the other was a huge risk. Untrue. Not even close to being equivalent choices.   The truth right here. oh oh.... I'm actually in that documentary! Always have.  Good luck winning a game of chess without your pawns. Uhhh... pretty much every scenario involves China going on the offensive.  EG: ""Taiwan becomes independent?  We promise to declare war on them."" Nuclear war = end of world.   Country (A) nukes country (B). B's allies nuke country A. A's allies nuke B's allies. World is gone. The draft scares the shit out of me. I will not fight for an orange cheeto They have no chance of winning. Military spending isn't even comparable. Might do a lot of damage though.  > While I agree the US has an advantage, I don't want to say that an industrialized country with 4 times our population has no chance of winning, especially if we have no support from Europe. It'd be a long and bloody fight, and probably will involve a draft. I'd really rather us not be a part of that.  This would be a sea war.   It's not bullshit reporting, the quotes from Chinese officials are all real. Now, you're right that there's no real risk of war, but to *call the reporting fake* shows you did not read the article, and just want to cry ""fake news"" What scares me is how surely I would blow my brains out at the first surefire signs of total societal breakdown. I think he's referring to Firefly I can't believe you haven't watched the future historical many-part documentary called Firefly. Also there are quite a few artificial islands in the area built by all the different countries who want to claim the area. China is actually super late to the artificial island show. I'm Australian but live and work in China. I fully agree with you sadly we are on a website where your point of view will be downvoted by ignorant haters or people who don't fully read or understand the situation.   I'd like to further add it's so hypocritical of the US... in the 1980's they mined Nicaragua's Harbors. Nicaragua attempted to Sue them in international court. The international court found the US guilty of this however the US denied international jurisdiction and refused to acknowledge any international ruling unless the US agrees to allow the case be seen in court.. Sounds like someone doesn't like other people playing by the same rules as themselves..   Furthermore it's funny how the USA is not actually a member of the 'Law of the sea treaty' but wants China to abide by the rules of it. Don't believe me? Look it up it's true.  You just have to understand that US military bases are Peace-Bases, while not-US bases are War-Bases. Simply really The SCS is obviously more important to China. I always saw people arguing that SCS is one of the most important trade route, and the free navigation is a core value of US so the only way left for China is to back down, but from China's point of view most of these trade route goes from and to China, if there is only one country who want to make sure the SCS is safe it got be China, and the US's operation in SCS is nothing about free or international law, but a desire of the feeling of control and power, mix with anxiety and insecurity from the recent China growth. None of that is relevant to the issue in the SCS.  China took a small sand bar which was underwater, and then literally built an island with sand and fill dredged up from the sea floor, then put missile launchers and an airport on it, and then declared it an island and Chinese territory, meaning that it now has a 24 mile diameter claim to the waters around it.  This island just so happens to be in the middle of one of the largest international shipping lanes in the world.    This is a geopolitical power grab without precedent.  It is illegal, and China would consider the United States ""building"" a similar island in the SCS an act of war. I think we should just authorize any country to build war base in international waters because US. War is perhaps the simplest, and among the most-effective means of re-directing a population's anger... as long as the enemy shoots first. Trump is begging for a war. It gives a nice bump to the incumbent. No one will notice his crazy edicts. A countries will for war isn't like physical stamina. If we engaged in a land War that was justified and had the public behind it that will will come back. You don't need will to fight *before* a war, it comes when that war begins. If China were to strike at US assets or allies, that will would materialize post-haste. As would the orders for several US carriers groups, the most powerful military assets on Earth, to show China what a strong naval tradition is. Japan learned this lesson long ago.  America. The 800 pound obese gorrilla. Needs to be carried on a stretcher to reach his bananas. Well if Heavyweights is any indication, that gorilla is in for a damn good time that was under obama I don't remember Iraq becoming part of the usa. We shouldn't have invaded Iraq. Most Americans think this. But nobody sanctions the US because it hurts us less than it hurts you. Not attempting to disagree, just stating why. Last time I visited the US, obesity wasn't as bad as I remember from previous visits. Could be random chance, I guess. Overweight, over fed and endangered. That's how that American commented sees America. The rest of the world sees America very differently, I think.  Do you have a source for this? All you've just described is China controlling its own stuff, and not having anything to do with anyone else. How does that indicate a desire to become a global hegemony? Any country has every right to operate in international waters, that is the whole point of international waters. The question- who throws the first nuke? I dont have much faith in ol' Donny > China is nuclear. That is the great equaliser.  If a nuclear exchange did occur, China might be able to destroy some of America's West coast. It would be devestating, but America would survive and recover. Meanwhile literally every inch of China would be turned to glass.   The only country with nuclear parity with the USA is Russia. The smaller nuclear powers like China, France, UK, India etc can ""only"" inflict massive damage to the US. They couldn't destroy it outright.  So in a nuclear war between China and America, both sides lose, but America loses a lot less. this isn't news period, it's an editorial :P I am now under the impression no one reads this website. If anything I feel posting here has zero impact so I do take some artistic license. I joined this website to find people of similar intelligence and interests. While there's been a handful of people that fit that description the rest are hopelessly ignorant, just like the worlds population. I appreciate your thoughts. By the spirits of Leslie Nielsen and Peter Sellers, can we make this movie? Starring Danny Trejo.  Alternatively this scenario will convince Mexico to build the wall. Let China and america go to war and keep mexico out of it. I can see this on some sort of a political cartoon Can't we just get Roger Waters? Building up the bricks between america and china. 5 dudes can probably break it down in a few hours. &nbsp;   Source: Mexican with Macgyver ass uncles.  Welp, [TIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_standoff).     >A Mexican standoff is a confrontation between two or more parties in which no participant can proceed or retreat without being exposed to danger. As a result, all participants need to maintain the strategic tension, which remains unresolved until some outside event makes it possible to resolve it. I suppose we could add North Korea and Japan to the mix. In this scenario they'd probably be perched up in their apartment building armed with sniper rifles. [Tell that bitch ta chill](https://youtu.be/aTLXGF0hS7M) Okay, thanks.  I did hear about the Taiwan call, but I didn't know if that was still viable since it was so long ago.  I had not heard about SecState implying a military blockade... Trump has already seriously pissed off the giants of Silicon Valley. If he starts so,e trade war with China, I bet half the Fortune 500 companies rage on republican reps and senators. They're spineless and pliable. They'll bring trump to heel and look good doing it to the non-idiotic republican voting bloc.  Perhaps South Korea wouldn't need missile defense if China would stop propping up the insane North Korean government.  China is the cause of these problems.... not Trump. Even though America is basically asking to be attacked when they fly their aircraft low over China's island bases.  No, America won't be disrespected like that. Are we supposed to take a kneel to the Chinese now? Probably true. China would likely not start a war with the US if that happened. Especially since the US would have no guarantee of coming out from a trade embargo with China better than China would.  A trade war with Mexico would have slightly different implications for the world economy and global stability than China. That said, I am not at all suggesting a trade war with Mexico is beneficial for anyone.  No matter what policies the USA may decide on, I think it's safe to say they're not planning on letting go of the reins of the most advanced and powerful army in the history of mankind.  It'll take decades still to top that kind of power projection even if Russia/China/... put absolutely all their eggs in one basket. Therefore China and Russia should become more powerful to offset the parity which currently tips overwhelmingly towards the US. Rome fell, just saying. It worked. you just slapped that guy in the face over the internet using facts And Stalin killed tens of millions of people. Awesome times. Americans are afraid of us because Cold War, Russians feel disdain for Americans because the communist era created a belief that Americans are:  1) Stupid  2) Helpless consumerists  3) Have no values Because they're right next to each other. It's possible (though difficult) to get the US to back off on regional affairs, but being literally next to each other, they will forever be competing in regional affairs.  We're just cattle in the hands of powerful people. If you see it that way, it's much easier to see where things are going.  Nobody ever has anyone's best interests in mind, however I feel like Trump and Putin will click together and find a common interest to stand for, mainly because both Putin and Trump are demagogues that like pretending to be the ""voice of reason"". > word or phrase to describe something that is simultaneously depressing and hilarious?  We don't have that one, do we?  Seems like we've got a word for most things.  This should exist.  Let's get it going.  I'll call it lacrimedy. Surely the Germans have a word for it. Soggy popcorn. The man of the common people? I thought he was a Washington outsider? I hadn't heard that.... Common people like him cause he's dumb like them. > What is the most appropriate word or phrase to describe something that is simultaneously depressing and hilarious?

Man, his cabinet of ex-Goldman Sachs execs (remember? the same ones that the right was so concerned owned hilary?) have a combined net worth greater than the bottom 1/3rd of the nation *put together*.   Any time I have mentioned this to a Trump supporter, I always get the same answer back: ""That means they know how to make MONEY!"" You could please say a few things like ""/u/Thedutchjelle is going to win the lottery"" or ""/u/thedutchjelle is going to find a gf"" ?      On a more serious note, I'll just sit this whole thing out. I can't really do much about it and if people want to nuke each other then whatever. >I've stopped saying ""x isn't going to happen. It can't happen"". Because every time I've done that, Improbable X has happened.  Tom Brady isn't going to lose this super bowl Remind Me 2 weeks! See you in a hundred years then  Yeah a war would be unbelievably costly for both sides.  Even just a purely naval conflict.  It would cost the US incredible amounts of money to send ships and lose many of them.  China's entire navy would be destroyed, and nothing would really change.      The foundation of the Sino-US relationship is the 'One China' consenus. Trump has gone out publicly and questioned the US adherence to that consensus. Without that consensus there can be no relationship and diplomacy.   China might be doing a bit of sabre rattling but it was the US who first started stirring the pot.  Both sides are provoking for internal gains.  However, I think China is being more militarily provocative.  I understand that we position our military in close proximity to their country, but you have to also consider their neighbors who resoundingly oppose China's territorial claims.  Building these sandcastles, putting military equipment on them, and then attempting to block US ships and planes in international territory is provocative.  That has been going on for a couple of years now but recently they seem to be leaking and making off handed remarks about military accomplishments and readiness.  I would guarantee (as a prestigious reddit user)  that if Obama called Taiwan it would not be nearly as big of a deal.  Trump has shown that he can be easily baited and it seems that is what they are trying to do.   Complex issue. Very interesting.  That happened before nuclear weapons were a thing. In today's world, a full-scale conflict between two nuclear armed nations is almost impossible. Any small-scale conflicts or frictions would quickly lead to a ceasefire, and one nation would lose out more on the terms of the ceasefire due to the difference in military strength, but that's it.  Superpowers have far too much to lose in the connected world of today. As the president of China, Xi Jinping himself put it, there is no Thucydides trap that would lead to war, only strategic miscalculations. Countries would only go to war if they grossly miscalculate their capabilities and strategic positions, the equivalence of giving up a basket of fruit for a single fruit that has fallen onto the ground. TIL 2017 = 1914 As far as on the books weaponry, China has the most advanced missile systems, ICBM's, and their fighter jets even rival our new YF-22 Raptors.  As for off the book records... who knows what the hell anyone really has -_- The U.S. would not start a blockade without neutralizing land base missiles, that's like trying to start a no fly zone while leaving enemy air defenses functioning, you're just giving your enemy a really easy target. Since an air incursion into Chinese air space with the purpose of destroying military installations would start a war the likes of which we've never seen, it is not that simple and will not just happen because Trump has an angry moment. Our generals aren't idiots, even if we think Trump is. Sorry, I should say Westerners and Communists or Americans and Soviets. I shouldn't say Communists because Yugoslavia loved Americans up until its dissolution. It takes quite of few nukes to kill the entire human race. I imagine only 0,1% of the land on earth would be uninhabitable if not less after such a theoretical war. I don't know much about the strategy of international politics, trade and economics - but I've wondered if this point isn't right on the money.  At least one kind of globalism (but sometimes the anit-globalists are talking of something different) is the entangling of superpowers in a relationship of co-dependence through economics.  It's hard to think of any other plausible way towards a (relatively speaking) peaceful world, where we never have to fight a world war again.  But on the other hand, its tough to swallow that we ought to sit in relative parity and co-dependence with regimes that do not value liberty. dang. can I have your stuff? Indeed. It's just that China is much better at it and has far more resources to expend.    fellow australian here, i can only say that this site is (usually) extremely biased whenever ""china"" comes up as a topic with people who have no knowledge spouting nonsense everywhere In exactly the same boat, an Aussie working in China. The amount of misinformation and bias on this site is unbelievable, especially considering a lot of people here like to think of themselves as ""reasonable and critical thinkers."" Anti-China/Pro Us rhetoric is only intensifying as people are looking for the new ""enemy."" And American drones are carrying payloads of peace. You must be living under a rock. Phillipines has ditched US to embrace China as of the past year. LOL It's not whataboutism, I'm offering you the actual reasons why China has been building in the SCS. It's not an act of aggression from a nation bent on building a global hegemony, as the US loves to claim, but a defensive act in response to 400 military bases being constructed around them.  I don't know much about the US-Philippines relationship, but i'm pretty sure Rodrigo Duterte had recently ordered all US troops out of the Philippines? (as in, definitely within the last couple of years)? Im sure the US military bases have been erected only to protect weak nations from evil bullies. Thank God for the United States. Exactly. Smaller countries that we've helped. That are our allies. That have fought side by side with us. Were loyal and hopefully we don't abandon our friends.  >China took a small sand bar which was underwater, and then literally built an island with sand and fill dredged up from the sea floor, then put missile launchers and an airport on it, and then declared it an island and Chinese territory, meaning that it now has a 24 mile diameter claim to the waters around it. This island just so happens to be in the middle of one of the largest international shipping lanes in the world.  You clearly have not read the article I linked to. In 2015 the US held a military ""exercise"" that organised their naval forces into a blockade in the pacific - essentially testing out whether they could quickly and efficiently cut off China's access to coal and oil. The SCS building started happening soon after this event.  >This is a geopolitical power grab without precedent. It is illegal, and China would consider the United States ""building"" a similar island in the SCS an act of war.  Excuse this childish response, but OBVIOUSLY China would perceive the UNITED STATES building in the South CHINA sea an act of war, but the UNITED STATES is HALF OF THE WAY AROUND THE WORLD from China.   Shouldn't the real issues be, ""how is the US allowed to build literally thousands of military bases in so many other countries around the world without those bases being reported as aggressive building by the US? Why is one sandbar with missile launchers on it (which, by the way, cannot reach the US) considered aggressive building by China? Why is the military base in South Korea, which also has missile launchers within easy range of Beijing, not considered aggressive?"" The enemy doesn't even have to shoot first. You just have to convince the population that the enemy is in the wrong, and this has already been done with respect to China and the South China Sea. The most likely path to a military conflict between the US and China is:  * Trump demands that China abandons its artificial island bases in the South China Sea. * China says no. * Trump sends the US navy to blow up the bases, according to the understanding that they are illegal. * China waits until the US fires the first shot, then retaliates. * War begins, Taiwan declares independence, etc.  It's not a very hard path for the US to take, and so the burden is actually on China to understand when they can't win, and to back off. And you'd be mistaken if you think the Chinese are going to shoot first.  If you have been paying attention, they're very careful to limit the extent of their aggression.  I'm sure Trump would love to goad them into firing the first shot, but he's going to find himself outmaneuvered because he's playing the game that China wants to play. That war would absolutely annihilate the global economy. It would be practically guaranteed to spark a massive recession, not to mention the loss of thousands, if not millions, of lives. I'd be curious to know if he's got any money tied up in a market that would profit from war, ala Haliburton during Iraq 2.0. That's a scary thought, but you're right. A war would be the best political move for Trump, because folks tend to lower their guard to authoritarianism when the country is at war. Trump's supporters would be willing to justify literally *anything* he did. How many millions would perish in a land war against China? Such a war would make anything except the world wars look like a game of CoD. If it happens, I sure hope Europe and Russia has the sense to stay out of it for once. You think people are going to rally against an offensive war against China?  Good luck with that. And even if you do that, a land war fought in China will be very hard. Millions will be pumped with iron and six feet under by the end.  Wasn't there something that went along with ""Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line""? Yes, because Australia and Japan, two countries that just got screwed by Trump canceling TPP, will now be much more likely to go to war with China for the US due to Trump's god tier diplomacy skills. Heh... yup.  The two situations could not possibly be more different. rest of world here, [this is what we think of America](https://i.imgflip.com/16h1l2.jpg) An interview he gave journalist from the washington post. Part of his statement:   > Being a great president has to do with a lot of things, but one of them is being a great cheerleader for the country, Trump said. And were going to show the people as we build up our military, were going to display our military. That military may come marching down Pennsylvania Avenue. That military may be flying over New York City and Washington, D.C., for parades. I mean, were going to be showing our military, he added.   [link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-donald-trump-came-up-with-make-america-great-again/2017/01/17/fb6acf5e-dbf7-11e6-ad42-f3375f271c9c_story.html?utm_term=.93783c02179f) Even china Really? Judging by the reports about how threatening Russian and Chinese airplanes/ships are in international waters/airspace i was sure that it was a US only space.    But if US can, try to deal with China. Watching US and China become enemies would be a blast. Much more fun than the relic of the cold war Russia, since it could not bite back as hard as China could.   > If a nuclear exchange did occur, China might be able to destroy some of America's West coast. It would be devestating, but America would survive and recover. Meanwhile literally every inch of China would be turned to glass.  Considering literally none of us known how many nuclear weapons China has, that's quite the presumption. And you don't need thousands of nukes to destroy a country. You only need to attack cities and bases. The UK could wipe out a vast majority of the US's population, as well as most of America's military capability, despite only having a few hundred nuclear weapons. The damage caused by 1000 nuclear weapons would not necessarily be that much worse than the damage caused by 100, because they would both completely cripple a country for generations to come.   1: It's not an editorial  2: You're insinuating real quotes are fake news because you don't like the source Can we throw Clive Owen in the mix, just because? UK represent. Yes. Please. Watch the movie ""Machete Kills"" Guaranteed satisfaction.  That'd be smart of them.  All the US has to do to ""win"" a war with China (both loose a but, China looses worse):  Declare no more trade with China other than deemed essential or priority goods for the next four years.  Will hurt the US, but the US can (mostly) get the cheap crap from elsewhere or just start to make non-crap that costs more but can be repaired.  Damage to China would be more than double (perhaps a multiple of double) the damage to the US.  Might be enough economic pain to trigger an internal revolt in China within a few years time.  Now, if there IS a limited shooting war as a result, the US would wind up doing the same thing (cut trade) for the same basic result (although the short term cut of quasi essentials would cause the US more pain than just cutting out the cheap crap).  China knows this.  Thus no shooting war.  I'm down, lol. Or he can just do the soundtrack! *breathes heavily...* he's... he's cool? Yeah it was a while ago but Trump did invite a Taiwanese delegation to the inauguration (not sure if they came or not) which brings it back into focus. Personally I don't think the blockade will happen, it wasn't directly stated just assumed by reporters and Chinese media because how else are you going to stop access, so I think it was just a statement made without much thought which is concerning in and of itself and kind of undermines my hopes. That makes absolutely no sense. THANK GOD Trump is pissing off Silicon Valley.  H1-B abuse is so rampant that it's not even abuse anymore - it's a way of life for all of the big tech companies.  They are deathly afraid that they're going to have to start hiring Americans when/if Trump follows through with the rumblings about a major overhaul of the program by Trump. Which becomes a chicken and the egg issue because they wouldn't need to prop up North Korea if US didn't have bases in SK. NK wouldn't be in its current state if US didn't repeatedly ignore Chinese warnings against approaching its boarder, resulting on the ensuing military response.  >Discounting the Chinese Threat  >In the face of these warnings, the JCS instructed MacArthur to continue his advance north to destroy the DPRK armed forces as long as there was no threat of a major Chinese or Soviet intervention. These instructions were based upon a National Security Council decision made before the Inchon landing.[26] The Secretary of State also disregarded these warnings, telling the press that Chinese intervention would be sheer madness.  >By the end of the month, the US Ambassador in Moscow reported that Soviet and Chinese contacts told both the British and Dutch Ambassadors that if foreign troops cross the 38th parallel, China would intervene.[27] This specific warning was also repeated to various journalists, and on 29 September, the Associated Press in Moscow reported that both China and the Soviet Union would take a grave view of US forces crossing the 38th parallel.[28] Finally, at the end of the month, in a major public policy address celebrating the first anniversary of the establishment of the Peoples Republic of China, Zhou En-lai branded the United States as Chinas worst enemy and stated that China will not allow a neighbor to be invaded.[29]  >Once again, these warnings were ignored, and US-UN forces continued to push the DRPK forces northward. On 2 October, Mao cabled Stalin advising that China would intervene and asked for Soviet military assistance.[30] Three days later, the CCP Central Committee officially decided to intervene.[31] US intelligence, however, continued its reporting theme that while Chinese capability was present, Chinese intent was lacking. On 6 October, the US Joint Intelligence Indications Committee stated that the Chinese capability to intervene had grown, but the Chinese threat to do so was questionable.[32] That same day, the CIA Weekly Summary advised that the possibility of Soviet or Chinese intervention continued to diminish. It also restated the belief that Soviet requirements would drive any such decision.  >Two days later, the Soviet position was delivered to the Chinese. Stalin advised Mao that the USSR could not provide the military supplies and air cover over Manchuria that Mao had requested. He also asked Mao not to engage in a large-scale offensive against US troops, because such an action might lead to a war between the United States and the Soviet Union.[33]  >On 12 October, CIA Office of Records and Estimates Paper 58-50, entitled Critical Situations in The Far EastThreat of Full Chinese Communist Intervention in Korea, concluded that, While full-scale Chinese Communist intervention in Korea must be regarded as a continuing possibility, a consideration of all known factors leads to the conclusion that barring a Soviet decision for global war, such action is not probable in 1950.[34] So, both the United States and the Soviet Union saw any large-scale Chinese intervention as potentially stimulating a global war, and the US understanding of the Soviet position was, indeed, sound. Internal Chinese priorities, however, continued to be discounted by Washington, which still believed that the Soviets controlled overall Communist actions worldwide.  >The next day, the CCP Politburo decided that China should intervene in the war even without Soviet military support. Based on this decision, it was Stalin who relented on his earlier request and agreed to provide military supplies against a Soviet loan extended to the Chinese. He also agreed to turn over Soviet aircraft in China to the PLA and to move Soviet air units into position to defend Chinese territory.[35] Thus, the Chinese not only made a unilateral decision to intervene for nationalistic purposes, but also intimidated the Soviets into supporting them.  https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/fall_winter_2001/article06.html  Feels like Reddit is repeating history as it questions China's willingness to use its military while discounting clear red lines. Well a trade war with Mexico would unify the Hispanic nations against the US while greatly serving Chinese interests. The US will probably no longer be a Super Power by the end of the semester. >  I think it's safe to say they're not planning on letting go of the reins of the most advanced and powerful army in the history of mankind.

Fitting quote for Reddit in general No it eventually didn't  yes? have they conquered the world and made a peaceful utopia? Guy was technically right though. Einstein never expressed it verbally. That wasn't a US+Russia thing, it was a Stalin thing. I kinda know that but what about China? I've read someplace that during the Cold War, Russia asked/told/requested that US didn't involve itself/retaliate in case of a nuclear war between Russia and China. And the only reason that such a war didn't start it's because US denied to not involve itself in a war between Russia and China. That's serious business and it's shocking to know that that enmity didn't subsided. Putin is using Trump.  Not clicking with or working with him.  Putin doesn't have Trump's or America's best interest in mind.  That's not a bad word. *Lacrimedy*. That's not a tinny sort of word at all. In Denmark we call it ""tragikomisk"". It is a fusion of the two words ""tragisk"" meaning tragic, and ""komisk"", meaning comical. How about ""trump"", I think that sums it up perfectly. we call it comic tragedy.  It has many precedents in history, and it's two faces are the faces of US carnival, Mardi Gras.   In Spanish is *tragicmico*. Yeah you have a word for everything when you just stitch words together. Doesn't make it pronounceable though. We could go with Tragicomic or Tragilarious. See, this half-assed attitude is why you can't get a girlfriend. /u/thedutchjelle will be searching the desolate wasteland that was his hometown and finds an empty bunker filled with food, video games, and 6 new Realdolls still in their box. The ""one china"" is bullshit, because everyone, including China knows, that Taiwan is an own country. It is time that 25 million people and their democratic elected governemnt can decide their own future and the big bully China without a legitimate government elected by its people should just stay quiet. but then SK ""resoundingly oppose"" Japan's territorial claims in SK-Japan disputes, Russia ""resoundingly oppose"" Japan's claims in Russia-Japan disputes, and so on and so forth. and it goes completely the other way as well.   China is in much closer proximity than the US to even the places where they have the least legitimacy in claiming, and yet the US is allowed to have their military travel anywhere and contain anyone they want without fear of being called ""aggressive"" or trying to colonize.   It really is very hypocritical.  The year is different. People are still the same.  I'd say the Chinese do outclass us in Anti-Ship missiles however the US has many more ICBM's than the Chinese and most of the Chinese missiles aren't equipped with MIRV's and thus should hopefully be able to be shot down. When it comes to aircraft the US greatly outclass the Chinese, their newest fighter the J-20 is likely to at least be comparable to the F-22 (YF-22 was the technology demonstrator designation and we've had them since the late 90's so hardly new) but they exist in far inferior numbers with no more than 10 produced that they're simply a non-factor in any possible engagement. The other new fighter the J-31 hasn't even been produced for deployment yet. China's missile systems aren't that advanced, and their ICBMs can't use MIRV warheads, which greatly reduces their effectiveness. As for jets... A) they only have like 10 J-20s, and they have several issues, B) they are comparable to the YF-22.... which was a tech demonstrator and far inferior to the F-22, and C), they're both last-gen.  > I should say Westerners and Communists  That also doesn't make sense for the same reasons.  > I shouldn't say Communists because Yugoslavia loved Americans up until its dissolution.  Yugoslavia is not a monolithic entity and had different positions with regards to the Soviet Union, USA, Communism, Socialism, Capitalism throughout its existence. What is ""radiation"" for $500, Alex?  No it takes very little of our super-powered nukes to fuck everything up. ( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013EF000205/full )  If you detonate about 50 of them (keep in mind that there are more than 15 000 currently in existence) it would put up enough black soot in the stratostphere to fuck up the sunlight and transform all of the planet in an inhabitable wasteland. You don't study physics or chemistry do you? Sure buddy. Hope you enjoy my 300 gig worth of painstakingly archived music files in the post-apocalypse...:D Thank fuck for your sane replies. Jesus, everytime China comes up, it's the same bullshit arguments and narrative that attack china.  And the ICBMs carry payloads of democracy. > It's not a very hard path for the US to take, and so the burden is actually on China to understand when they can't win, and to back off.  It all comes down to how everybody prepares for the conflict, and the following factors are the most important:  1. How far is the US actually willing to commit to this war?  2. How long can Taiwan defend itself.   If Taiwan is unable to defend itself long enough for significant US assistance to arrive in time, or if the US is not willing to fully commit, the result is a Taiwanese annexation.   If the US is willing to fully commit, and Taiwan is able to hold off, then you have a military confrontation which will result in many dead and a recession for everybody involved, if not worse.   Everybody knows China is going to be very committed. The question will fall onto Taiwan, and, given that it is going to be a defensive war, how long the US public is willing to allow the farce to continue on.    You're scaring the crap out of me right now  feels vaguely like spanish american war/korean war/vietnam war, cold war.... wait China has a totalitarian regime. They have a culture where losing face is to be avoided at all costs. Their population is 4 times that of the US. They have a strong industry. They have huge armed forces. They have modern weapons. They have nukes.  I don't doubt that the US would ""win"" a total war scenario, but I don't think the US could win a regional/limited war in the South China Sea. Thinking it is ""not a very hard path for the US to take"" is extremely dangerous. A total war would leave no victors, only destruction. > Trump sends the US navy to blow up the bases, according to the understanding that they are illegal.  Even if they *are* illegal does not mean the US Navy can go around blowing things up.   > It's not a very hard path for the US to take, and so the burden is actually on China to understand when they can't win, and to back off.  It is unclear who will win in a standoff in the South China Sea. A standoff does not mean actually shooting, just lots of actions to harass the other side. Given the geographic location, it is far cheaper for the Chinese to harass the Americans, then the other way around.    >It's not a very hard path for the US to take, and so the burden is actually on China to understand when they can't win, and to back off.  And that's where you are wrong. It's the US who can't win. They will not understand that before they've lost most of their naval forces, but that's fine. Well then they're playing with fire, because I'm sure there's nothing that Trump would like more than to aggressively posture himself in the South China Sea, and it's a conflict that China is very unlikely to win. You're right. One is shooting fishermen with waterguns. The other is condemning hundreds of thousands to death and destabalising the region in an illegal war.   Could not possibly be more different.

They just can't stay globally competitive by hiring stupid ones with no skills, hence the need for highly educated foreign workers.   If you're actually world class talent (or even just minimally competent) there's no trouble getting a job in silicon valley, it's just entitled losers who feel like being born in the right place makes a high paying job their birthright who are having issues competing in the job market.      So I don't think it's true that they're afraid of hiring Americans.  They're just afraid they'll have to lower their quality standards by having to hire *only* Americans...they're scraping the bottom of the barrel as it is, tbh, and still can't get enough competent people, even with he current situation.     Lol no.  Mexico closer to china already happened a long time ago with their port deals and China buying up companies.  A trade war wouldn't change a thing.  If anything it would benefit the us by putting much needed pressure on them to reel in the ridiculous one sided deals they demanded a long time ago.  We have been incredibly patient so far. The guy said he never ""said it"" but he did likely say it in his head if he wrote it. Just an alternative view.  Which the US ignored, despite that claiming the result of World War 2 as some kind of morally superior victory, dragging the whole world into your bloody rivalry immediately afterwards. But hey, *""look what we accomplished!""* is an easier mindset to have. You don't know that. Nobody does.   All we can do is sit back, wait, and watch. It only took me a couple minutes to conceive it, but it required a life time of laughing through my tears. No. No. Quite woody. Quite woody Lacrimas for tears and -medy for comedy? I like it Better than my original suggestion of Tragedy, traj- from tragedy, and -edy from comedy. I don't think it worked as well as yours though... Doesn't work in English because that a euphemism for farting. In English it's tragicomic. German word for it is actually tragikomisch so that fits. Be that as it may, international politics and diplomacy don't work on 'what should happen' but what is the reality. The reality is that any formal declaration of independence by Taiwan will lead to war, and the Taiwanese people know it. That's why even they won't support independence but rather the status quo.  The weapons are very different. FALLOUT 5 CONFIRMED One world ran under a globalized economy, and the other didn't. I don't understand why people keep having this notion that another world war is looming on the horizon.   The people are not the same. Europe in 1914 was a powder keg, people wanted to go to war. They didn't know the horrors of the modern battlefield. They thought that the war would be over by winter. If archduke ferdinand wasn't assassinated, something else would've started WWI  That's not the case here. Our world has become very globalized. Things that happen on one side of the globe can and will also affect the other side. Our economies are very connected, declaring war will tank our economies and spiral it into another depression. It's why the U.S. never bother to challenge Russia after the Crimea situation or the Ukraine civil war.    Read an article a little while ago that basically says yes, every hundred years or so we have a fucking massive period of destruction and decline. Be it caused by disease, war, whatever; it happens.  Right now we are entering one such period. It might feel like the end of the world, like life as we know it is being irrevocably changed, but it probably felt that way in the middle ages with the Black Death, and I bet it definitely felt that way on the Western Front in 1914. People survive, people grow, and from the ashes they rise... Providing those ashes aren't radioactive, in which case they'll rise as gamma-zombies or something, and ya know... that's pretty exciting, right? Good to know! What I've heard was learned from articles citing particular cruise missiles, and ICBM's being more advanced than any other nation. Considering how much money they're pouring into their military expanse, coupled with most nations getting their technology made in China -- lead me to believe it's a likely scenario.  Also I thought the YF-22 and F-22 were the same exact plane, just that the 'Y' was sometimes dropped. I don't claim to be too up to snuff with military weaponry -- Just what I've read in various articles which are or are not accurate depending upon the journalist.  Curious -- I remember reading that the F-22 is possibly the last manned aircraft as it greatly exceeds what the human body is capable of withstanding with lots of room to maneuver beyond that that point. It depends on which nukes we use, actually.  If we could fast-track the Neutron Bombs into production (or if we have secret stock like many people theorize), we could easily destroy their population with minimal effects elsewhere in the world. Radiation taken into account. Look at Ukraine. The uninhabitable area isn't too big. Sure, a nuclear war would be devastating, but not doomsday-like. Most lethal radiation is gone within a very short time.  Consider the fact that Hiroshima has been continuously populated since the atomic bombing. Don't be scared. The war with China will be over very fast. If you don't want to deal with fallout and watching people you care about die, get close to a military installation as soon as the nukes start flying. The Dong Feng will burn things up within a couple of miles. Imagine that, human civilization ends because americans wanted to see ""liberal tears""  never underestimate human stupidity Even in a limited regional war, the US would prevail.  The US would be able to gain air superiority and naval superiority rather quickly.  Any radar installations used for guiding missiles would get neutralized quickly. That is a serious overestimation of Chinese military capabilities, last I checked the US had 11 carrier groups to a single Chinese owned Soviet relic. Similarly, the Chinese Air Force is entirely untested and all their technology has been developed via cloning systems they have 'borrowed' from other countries, there is no chance that they can face the US in naval or air conflict. What the Chinese *do* have is a massive wall of bodies to stack at their own doorstep so defensively speaking I doubt the US could touch them without going nuclear, I don't really see a reality where we try to invade mainland China though. As to the culture and industry of China you are failing to account for the fact that their population is massively oppressed and totally ripe for unrest, paying slave wages is well and good until bombs start dropping and workers realize their lives are worth more than a dollar a day.   The US would unequivocally demolish the Chinese in a regional conflict because no one does force projection better than we do. The US has several friendly nations and bases in the neighborhood, political support from the countries currently being railroaded by the Chinese, and a military that is both larger and far more advanced than anything China could hope to field. Should we avoid armed conflict at all cost? Absolutely. Does China know we would curb stomp them in any conflict so all this trash talk is opportunistic sabre-rattling? Most definitely. They have population and a strong industry, but are hopelessly out-matched in terms of conventional warfare regardless.      Their infantry is not nearly as mobile as it needs to be (lack of proper mechanization, especially helicopters, relies primarily on trains to move around). Comparatively, US ground forces are highly mobile (there are I think upwards of 6,000 helicopters to the Chinese ~800). As well, the current Chinese military has far less experience in fighting modern wars than the US. (Although to be fair the US experience is primarily in anti-insurgency and asymmetrical warfare).    In the air, the USAF both outnumbers and out-techs the PLAAF; the Chinese airforce (I believe in the neighbourhood of 1500 aircraft) is only about 50% modern (that being 4th generation or newer aircraft), the other half being remnants from the Cold War. By comparison, the USAF has I think about 5,000 aircraft with about 2/3rds being modern (though in fairness the F-15 is an early 4th generation plane). The United States has a much more highly developed air infrastructure in terms of airports and aircraft carriers (which I will get to next).    Now looking purely at numbers, again China appears to have the advantage at sea, outnumbering the US by a bit less than 2 to 1. However, China has a single aircraft carrier: the US has *nineteen*. The ability to deploy aircraft from a mobile platform is hugely important (especially given the USAF's existing superiority). The numbers again are misleading, in that about 20% of the Chinese navy is composed of small patrol craft. I can't speak all too much to the quality of the ships on either side, so I won't conjecture further.      Speaking just in terms of defensive mobility and infrastructure, the United States has a vast edge. The US has far better highway and rail networks along which transport personnel and equipment. They have more oil, they have a larger budget, and a very self-defence oriented culture (according to Wikipedia, there are 112 legally owned guns for every 100 Americans, and only about 5 guns per hundred Chinese).      I don't doubt that the Chinese could give the US a good tussle, but without significant allies (or a large and sudden improvement of their military) I can't imagine them effecting major triumph.      TL;DR China is big, but big =/= better.      Also, a lot of this information might be out of date/slightly inaccurate, this was a slapdash summary based mostly from memory. Thank you for emphasizing total war.  We start to truly eclipse them in aspects that cause tremendous devastation.  It's not like we have soldiers with exoskeletons and they are still using t-shirts - we've got more accurate bombs, navy, and Air Force.  These things yield mass casualties.  If China was next doors to the US - say, where Canada is today - then your analysis would make sense, and the US would have to be very, very careful about engaging China in a total war, since there is a high possibility of them being able to leverage their massive man power and their many missile platforms into mutually destructive behavior that would result in both countries being ruined.   But China is not next doors to the US. They are on the other side of the Pacific Ocean. To get to the US, they would have to get through the massive US fleet, consisting of 11 carrier battle groups, which give the US complete air and naval supremacy. Their only way of doing actual physical damage to the US would then be through long range ballistic missiles, which they likely won't use because it'd start a nuclear war in which they can only lose. The US will take economic hits, certainly, and military losses, perhaps even severe military losses. But all the actual physical destruction will be on their side, for not only can the US rain destruction on China through carrier battle groups, but can also bomb their territory from bases in Japan and South Korea. Thus, unless China has the ability to neutralize Japan and South Korea AND fight off US carrier groups at the start of the war, they simply cannot avoid getting into a war of attrition that will see their country ruined, and the US relatively unscathed.  Consequently, the US military advantage against China is actually quite massive, and will remain so until China develops either a blue water navy competitive with the US's, or develops so many nukes and ballistic delivery devices that nobody wants to bluff China for fear that they push the FUCK THE WORLD button. I find the latter scenario more practical for them as I don't think China will ever be able to overcome US advantages in the Pacific. Not unless they can get Japan on their side, which due to history is simply impossible. > I don't doubt that the US would ""win"" a total war scenario, but I don't think the US could win a regional/limited war in the South China Sea.   We'd stomp them at sea. I don't think we'd be storming beaches so man power is a non-issue.  Here's the thing - the US isn't going to fire the first shot either.  And if nobody fires a shot, China wins. China has far shorter supply-lines than the US to a conflict in the South China Sea. I don't doubt that the US would win a global total war kind of conflict, but I strongly doubt that a regional conflict could be outright won. It could end in a draw like it did in Korea, a Pyrrhic victory, or it could end in disaster. [lol](http://i.imgur.com/pt0EdrV.jpg) China has claimed those waters as theirs territorial waters for ages - and multiple other countries in the area have conflicting claims with one another. Some waters have overlapping claims from four or five countries.

Alternative Fact That was communism vs capitalism. Communism died the war is national interests vs liberal scum and we can all get on board to annihilate the liberal chinese.  You should submit it to the dictionary people The difference between tragedy and comedy is largely one of point of view though. Or you know, also a real word.  I thought it was lacrimedy.  I like yours better though. too bad thats not a real word Not arguing against the idea that mutually assured destruction etc. due to nukes might make people more cautious, but the lesson of history is also that things can get out of hand really, really fast and that humans are not always rational actors (in fact they rarely are).   It's incredible that you could argue a world war can't happen, and use *Crimea* as an argument for it; when just a few years ago, everybody thought *the exact same damn thing* about landgrabs happening in Europe through force.  I remember in command and conquer generals I used to neutron bomb my friends tanks and steel them with my massive infantry army and narcisitically laugh at his frustration. But seeing something like that in real life. Where everyone just straight up dies with no warning and no damage to infrastructure is horrifying imagery. >""Five days or five weeks or five months, but it certainly isn't going to last any longer than that.""  -Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense, on the Iraq war    >Its silly talking about how many years we will have to spend in the jungles of Vietnam when we could pave the whole country and put parking stripes on it and still be home for Christmas.  -Ronald Reagan, Governor of California, on the war in Vietnam    >""My opinion is that this war will be closed in less than six months from this time.""  -Union Soldier, from letter written before the battle of Shiloh, early in the US civil war Shit man. If it gets out that we have carrier groups moving to the SCS for a confrontation, I'm getting the F out of here.   I'm already feeling paranoid enough to prepare a ""go bag"", starting to collect information from my international friends in the ""God-forbid"" case that I need to flee the States, and collect my documents to be able to take off at a moment's notice.   I'm not dying in no nuke strike, and I'm *definitely* not getting drafted by an authoritarian to go drown in the Pacific. How much of the combined American forces would be committed to a limited regional war? Do you think popular opinion at home would support a commitment large enough to win such a war? How many American deaths before the US has to withdraw from the war due to popular opinion at home? Don't mistake China for Iraq.  Let's hope we never find out. China doesn't have carrier groups because China is a primarily defensive force. US built carriers because of its role as the peacekeeper for NATO, which necessitates force projection with its navy.   The US would never fight a war on their turf nor will China land troops in the US. At most it is going to be a confrontation between the carrier group and chinese fleet with anti-ship missiles.  You also severely underestimate Chinese patriotism. US can only win at naval warfare, but in land warfare on China's doorstep, US cannot defeat China. The Vietnam wars and Korean war is a testament to China's land warfare ability. Would the US commit 11 carrier groups to this? How many of them could be lost before popular opinion in the US demands either a withdrawal from the conflict or a commitment to total war?  I have no doubt the US would win a total war scenario, but I expect the casualties on the American side to dwarf any previous conflict.  Let's hope we never find out. > As to the culture and industry of China you are failing to account for the fact that their population is massively oppressed and totally ripe for unrest, paying slave wages is well and good until bombs start dropping and workers realize their lives are worth more than a dollar a day.  Quality of life for most Chinese has positively exploded over the last 20-30 years. They've gone from primarily agricultural to manufacturing to post-industrial in just a few decades. There are a lot of people who are *extremely* loyal to the government system as a result. The amount of disposable income for median Chinese household has doubled every six-eight years or so for almost almost two decades.   Also you are badly underestimating China's ability to force-project locally. China is a modern industrialized nation with a large and competent military that surely understands American doctrine and has some tricks up its collective sleeves. In a real war (the US hasn't really been in one since the 50s) no one fights fair - everyone plays dirty and does what you least expect them to do. We wouldn't need nukes to invade mainland, just an 8 month bombing campaign after we establish dominance in the sea and air. US can only win at naval warfare, but in land warfare on China's doorstep, US cannot defeat China. The Vietnam wars and Korean war is a testament to China's land warfare ability. It may be just a meme, but isn't the US Navy second only to the USAF in terms of number of aircraft in the world? they'd sink your fleet with nukes/swarms of explosive drones, what then? Which is the last thing Trump wants... If it ACTUALLY came down to that, I'm willing to bet he'll take the first shot. > China has far shorter supply-lines than the US to a conflict in the South China Sea.  Did you forgot about all the allied naval bases nearby? That's supposing that the US went in alone, but I think everyone in the region would support the US in a conflict against China.  No one wants China there, because they'd be terrible for trade.  I think Australia in particular would join the US in a heartbeat.   Those claims are counter to international law (edit:**that China has signed and ratified are we just going to keep ignoring this here? Speech500's comment below ignores that 160 countries got together to write UNCLOS, the treaty that governs how territorial waters are set and what is allowed in international waters. China is free to leave this treaty if they wish, but until then they should abide by what they signed**), and are far beyond the 12 mile territorial water limit. The length of the claim is not important here, the UN courts have already decided. They also decided you can't artificially build islands to stake a claim. [removed] Not how the world works.  We have more then enough domestic production to meet needs,  as in we could be self sufficient.  Price of all the cheap goods would go up,  Walmart aisles would suffer;  but the American way of life would go on.  Domestic manufacturing would catch up and within a decade we would be back to the same level of overindulgence.  The rest of the world would absolutely suffer without us if we stopped producing goods in foreign country's.    Especially if we blocked certain technologies like CPU's,  electronics from being licensed and sold in other country's.  Not saying that our business's would necessarily stand united with America in a trade war,  just that if they did we would decimate country's like Mexico,  and put a hurt on country's like China.   Would it be in our interest to do so?  In my opinion the long term benefits are greater for us if we did.  It would benefit us long term to suffer the temporary hardships a trade war might impose (like not being able to buy trinkets and 4.99$ sweatpants at Walmart); I just doubt the government and American people as a whole have the spine to shove it to the people that need it shoved to them.  I should.  There are dictionary people, did you know?  It's called the usage council.  I remember thinking that sounded like a fun gig when I was a kid.  I doubt it pays well. Tragedy is when I cut my finger.  Comedy is when you walk into an open sewer and die.  \- Mel Brooks It is a real German word. Tragikomdie meaning tragic comedy.   Here is the dictionary entry : http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Tragikomoedie  It actually is. And it just further proves my point. Crimea happened. The Ukraine civil war happened. But none of them started a world war.  Or for instance, how there was only something like an 8% chance of Donald Trump winning the presidency the day before the election. Those minute chances are still a valid and scary possibility.  There was massive public backlash against Neutron Bombs both times the US tried to produce them. No this war actually *would* be over fast. Because everyone would be dead. MAD is still in play.  > Its silly talking about how many years we will have to spend in the jungles of Vietnam when we could pave the whole country and put parking stripes on it and still be home for Christmas.  So apparently Reagan made these comments in '65. By that time the French had long since been driven out of Indochina (Vietnam). LBJ (and later Nixon) also authorized huge bombing campaigns that didn't work. If nukes start flying there will be nowhere to hide or flee to.  Since we're theorizing. Only industrial and military targets would be destroyed first. There are people at the other end as well. And hopefully we don't piss them off by targeting their civilians. Although, with Russians, it's a bit of a risk. They may target civilian centers just for the fuck of it. Like a video game. I still think, Canada will be fine. No one really wants to hurt the Canadians. And yes, got my route planned and cash and gold ready to go. Anyone stupid enough to believe anyone will nuke unless a last resort is not educated enough to be listened to. Simple as. If China were to lets say pull a Japan and launch a surprise attack, the USA's attitude would do a complete 180 towards war.  December 6th, 1941 the day before Pearl Harbor, the general consensus was the USA would avoid war at all costs as the country was suffering from the great depression still, and if attacked it would try to negotiate its way out in order to avoid more bloodshed.  If the surprise attack does enough damage the USA would probably be willing to do anything and pay any cost to win.  Also for the US to win it just has to blockade China and target farms and factories with airstrikes, as China does have to feed over a billion people. I agree with you that it would be best to not find out.  However, I think the US casualties would be higher than Iraq, which in turn would motivate the US public to want to fight more. I don't disagree, I just don't really see a reality where the US enters a land war with China, they just don't have anything the US particularly wants.  I don't know about all 11 but what was Obama's pivot plan, 80% or something? Having 7 or 8 carrier groups floating through your backyard is a serious problem, especially when your outdated technology makes getting into the heart of one problematic. I definitely agree though, loss would be steep for the US because I do not doubt that the Chinese would take a Russian approach and hurl bodies at us until it hurt too bad to keep fighting. Like congress or the American public will allow US to move 11 carrier group to south asia sea.   If US was a dictatorship it might happen. Unfortunately US is a democracy during a period of high antiwar sentiment. There is absolutely no political appetite for anything resembling a war, especially against a power like China.   Furthermore the US attack won't even achieve much. You can't invade China, far too difficult and costly. All you can do attempt to gain air supremacy in a huge territory while slowly losing your ships and aircraft to missiles. Which we know they are dumping money into its development,  but we don't know how capable they are.  It would be an absolutely pointless endeavour. > Quality of life for most Chinese has positively exploded over the last 20-30 years. They've gone from primarily agricultural to manufacturing to post-industrial in just a few decades. There are a lot of people who are extremely loyal to the government system as a result. The amount of disposable income for median Chinese household has doubled every six-eight years or so for almost almost two decades.  I'm not arguing that China isn't a growing threat but the improvement you are referencing is fairly easy to obtain when you are literally beginning from zero, if everyone was a dirt floor rice farmer 2 decades ago then progress seems stellar. What I am arguing, though, is that culturally speaking the nation is a powder keg that is ripe for exploding: oppressive government policies, starvation wages, extreme over crowding, and serious wealth inequality mean that a shooting war has serious potential to rock the cultural status quo.   >China is a modern industrialized nation with a large and competent military   Large, yes, but competent or well equipped? That remains to be seen. Most of their tech is cloned from other nations and they haven't been involved in real conflict in quite some time. I won't argue that US operations in the Middle East constitute a war with an equal opponent but there is something to be said for having a command structure in place that is accustomed to  actual conflict. My money is far and away on the US every single time.  I imagine that the USAF could easily overpower the PLAAF; do not overlook the importance of air superiority. I don't believe that either side could launch a successful ground invasion of the other. (I think China has an even worse chance than the US, given US air and naval superiority).     Re Vietnam and Korea: that was a very, very long time ago (and in the case of the Vietnam war, a very different context; it was a guerilla war in which the primary Chinese action was providing support and material, not actually fighting in a conventional capacity). Possibly, but it's much, much harder for him to win if America is the aggressor. Which will be targeted by literally thousands of Chinese mainland based ballistic and cruise missiles at the first stage of war.      In the context of a conflict of this scale, I doubt Australia could make much of a difference. I mean, their armed forces are limited compared to the US and China, and their supply lines would also be long.  Of course you have closer allies, such as South Korea, Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines that could make a difference. I still doubt any land-invasion of China could result in anything but a complete loss for the American side or nuclear war as a last resort from the Chinese side. At best a Pyrrhic victory.  This is scary as hell to think about - I truly hope Trump and Xi Jinping has more sense than we have given them credit for in this thread. > Australia in particular would join the US in a heartbeat  Maybe if the conflict was against some no name nation that couldn't do anything back. Outside of the unlikely efficacy of the Australians in that war, they would suffer huge economic repercussions for an offensive war. You understand that China is Australia's largest market right, the destination of 1/3rd of all Australian goods and where 1/5th of their imports come from?  Additionally, politically supporting and actually fighting a war are two very different concepts. And even then, I think you overestimate the level of support you're going to get. All the countries in the region, regardless of their political crises and activities, are close trading partners with China. In the case of the Indo-Chinese nation, any vietnamese support is almost for sure going to guarantee Chinese troop movement. Even if you want to point to the Sino-Vietnamese war as an example of Vietnam fighting against China relatively successfully, bloodshed wise, most of the statistics point to Vietnam overwhelmingly losing out, with agricultural industries and more halted partially as a result of the war.   So no, most likely, the US will be going in there alone, or with only minimal support. Also, the reason everybody is fighting over the region is not because of trade. China has not threatened trade in the region nor has it claimed that it plans to control the routes and selectively allow ships passed; the reason everybody wants that territory is because of the resources that lie underneath.   And even if you did go in there and manage to somehow win a war, after thousands upon thousands of casualties, what's the end result going to be? Are you going to require an indemnity from China? Good luck getting them to pay; that would assume you actually stepped foot into mainland China and made headway. Are you going to make them agree to Taiwanese Independence? Good job. You've only done a little in changing the realities of their situation. It's helpful but will it be worth the billions spent and the thousands dead? Meanwhile, don't forget that we'll all be suffering as a result of this conflict.  You read way too much misinformation on this issue from Western media. The only southeast asian country that would support the US in a conflict against China is Vietnam. All other countries have relatively good ties with China and stand to lose a LOT economically if they went against China. Australia, in particular, has China as its largest trading partner, its total trade with China about equal to the sum of its next three top trading partners. China, along with many countries, just sees those international laws as the unfair imposition of western values and restrictions upon weaker countries. And they're not entirely wrong. Because it's a simple fact that a lot of international laws exist purely because America, and America's friends, wanted to dictate the world. I'm not saying international laws are bad, but I do understand why certain countries would dislike them or refuse to acknowledge them. It's very questionable whether such a western-centric set of laws should even apply any more, in a world where the west controls an increasingly small slice of the pie.  International law pretty much equals American law, lets not forget America plays international police. Where are ""CPU's"" and ""electronics"" manufactured these days? Do you really feel all that in control? oops. would have guessed 2 k#s, i suck You realize the Nazis and Japanese were doing a lot of land grabbing without starting a world war... until they started a world war, right?  Japan grabbed Korea, Taiwan, etc, not a world war. Germany grabbed disputed land from neighbors. Not a world war. Then, a world war.  People are trying to tell you to look at the SIGNS. There are SIGNS leading up to major shifts. No; what that proves is that reality pays our beliefs about what can and can't happen no mind.  It was already true that it is naive to think a world war can't happen anymore.   On top of that, when Crimea happened, there was still sane leadership in the west. The Trump administration on the other hand, comes across as completely unhinged, and has already proven its inability to govern effectively in numerous ways. I have no confidence about the notion that they won't escalate things to the breaking point. You have to have blinders on to state with any degree of confidence that things can't possibly get real fucking bad real fucking quick.  I think he meant wasn't that Crimea will start WWIII but that just like you're saying WWIII can never happen, Europeans said that there could never be military conquests by a developed country in a post Cold War world. Very true, but I doubt that unless the US lands troops on Chinese mainland, there won't be nukes flying.  Very true unfortunately. If a nuclear exchange were to start, every nuclear capable country would likely be involved within minutes. Depending on where you're located, you might survive the initial destruction, but everything would be so fucked for so long afterward that you'll probably wish you hadn't. That's exactly the opposite of what happened in Vietnam and things today are much more real with up to the minute pictures/videos.   Thousands of dead American soldiers and it would be social media 24/7.   That war would not be one America would stand for.  Idk about it being that hard to sink the carriers I seem to recall a story going around a while ago (might be mis remembering it was 1+ years ago) about a Chinese sub popping up right next to a carrier group undetected and while that glaring flaw in US ASuW might have been remedied there's still the threat of the ""Carrier Killer"" missiles like the DF-21D which I'm sure the Chinese have been devoting a lot of resources to in the past few years > e I do not doubt that the Chinese would take a Russian approach and hurl bodies at us until it hurt too bad to keep fighting.  In a sea battle, I'm not seeing how bodies would help much....attempted to pile on those tiny pacific islands(with few or no civilians to worry about) is just asking to get pounded by air or ship artillery.  Air and naval superiority did not win the Vietnam or Korea wars, and China has exponentnially gotten more powerful since then, closing the gap in tech, air, naval, etc...   It's not a very long time ago, since US has not achieved any materially innovative weaponry that China hasn't achieved yet (ie. GPS, stealth, aircraft carriers, etc... China has now)  If US couldn't defeat China back then, it's unlikely to win any landwars on it's borders. That's why even Taiwan is going to be ditched by US.    Air superiority rely entirely on carriers, and China has been developing military technology in the past decade with the primary goal of defeating carrier groups.  Feel free to underestimate them. Its not so much that Australia as a military force would make a difference. But it is a secure place to make a staging ground for such a war. Safe ports, island continent and existing American bases would all assist greatly in an effort to contain China. China also hve a lot of enemies in the region with rather large populations. > All other countries have relatively good ties with China and stand to lose a LOT economically if they went against China.   They're the ones bitching and asking for US help. If they don't want us there, and are happy to concede territory to the chinese, they are welcome.  Then they shouldn't have signed and ratified the treaty... Who else has problems with freedom of navigation and the limits of international waters?  The US didn't ratify UNCLOS, so you're wrong there too. They are a signatory and still uphold freedom of navigation. > It's very questionable whether such a western-centric set of laws should even apply any more, in a world where the west controls an increasingly small slice of the pie.  I'd normally agree but in this care its less east versus west but china vs anybody else who wants a claim.  Then again, I don't blame them for trying.  The current UNCLOS was negotiated between 160 nations...  In fact, the US didn't like the agreements from 1994 and didn't ratify the latest version. Framing this as American law is pretty silly.  The US still abides by UNCLOS and is one of the few countries with a large enough navy to enforce it. Yeah that was WWII. You know, before the invention of nuclear weapons, before our economies were deeply linked, before globalization.   That's was 70 years ago. From WWI to WWII it was only 30 years. After WWII, countries around the world created the UN (a far better counterpart to the League of Nations) in order to prevent another world war.   Look at us now, still no world war. Even during the Cuban missile crisis, the situation then was far more volatile than our now, we had American ships staring down Soviets ships moments away from nuclear detonation. But that didn't happen. Even the people then knew that a world war would be absolutely catastrophic.    Trump is blinded by greed. He's a businessman not a politician. A world war would not financially benefit him or his companies at all. There would be not way he would let that happen.   Sure, he'll say things here and there, he'll rant on Twitter, but there's a big difference from saying you might declare war than actually doing it.  What? When did they say that?  there might be a couple flying at the carrier group If it's the same story I remember then the sub was a Swedish diesel boat that managed to slip inside the group and nab the Reagen but the point definitely stands. I think the trick is that the sub would need to slip in 8 different times, that's the perk of having that many carriers.  As to the missiles I would think the US strategy would look a lot like our early move in OIF in that the Air Force would melt the majority of missile and radar sites before the carriers ever got in range. Sure as shit not gonna be as simple as steam rolling the Iraqis but I would wager we got a plan for that. One of the future types of warfare that the US is preparing for involves swarm tactics that would allow a whole shit load of small threats to overwhelm one of our carrier groups. It is not unreasonable to think that a Chinese strategy to counter our carrier groups would involve a large amount of low cost vessels attacking our ships in waves, think a couple hundred lightly armored speed boats that would blaze through defense and basically kamikaze our large ships. In that type of strategy having a large number of bodies with relatively low cost per unit would give the US some serious trouble. I was really referring to any ground fighting that would occur though, trying to take on any sort of land engagement on the Chinese mainland would invariably see hordes of low-investment units being tossed at US forces until sentiment shifted and we pulled away. People also like to ignore the fact that building machines and weaponry for projection and offensive capabilities is infinitely more difficult to build for defensive capabilities, and that pioneering new technologies is much more expensive then rebuilding on the footsteps of others.   This is why China primarily focuses on defensive technologies. In doing so, if a war breaks out and they are forced onto the defensive, it's just a long, drawn-out conflict until the US public loses its appetite for war.    This is the thing I don't get. Even if you don't believe in DF-21, at least have some respect for one of the most powerful and ingenious military nations in world history - (remember Sun Tzu?) - to do what you least expect and to hold a trump card or two in reserve.   Zero-day software exploits, drone swarms, EMP weapons, agents provocateur, exotic and/or unconventional weapons you and I can't even imagine - overtly attacking China on their own home turf seems like a hilariously awful idea.  Really? Who exactly asked for US presence there? The last I've heard, the Philippine president wants the US military out of their country.  They probably ratified the treaty for the same reason everyone else did - because the most powerful countries pressured it on the rest of the world.  > Who else has problems with freedom of navigation and the limits of international waters?  I don't have statistics on this specific law, but I can say with complete surety that a lot of countries (most of which are developing ones) consider international laws to be an imposition of western values.  Kinda. China isn't the only country in the area with conflicting claims. [It's a whole mess.](http://www.npr.org/news/graphics/2012/09/map-island-dispute-624.gif) China is just the only country to actually enforce their claims.

"28",27,"5r1m83","2017-01-30","It was, that's historical fact. Not sure why he should apologize for stating a fact, the entire palastine/jerusalem area was inhabited by jews before the muslim invasions. Next up - Palestinians demand apology when UN chief says Parthenon Greek, Big Ben British. Sorry, Palestinians. Those who know verifiable historical fact when they see it reject your attempts to erase Jews from the history books. Give it a couple of years and they'll be able to say Palmyra never existed. Kind of like certain Buddhist sites in Afghanistan have been wiped from the record. Centuries from now, people will say there's no evidence, just some people wrote about these places once. It's just a myth.   It was.  And in an act of pettiness and immaturity, the muslims destroyed what was left and built a mosque on top of it, purely out of spite.  It's time for the spite mosque to go. The question is, is the UN chief a big enough pussy to do it? How is this even controversial? Facts have a zionist bias  [removed] This is like the Palestinians demanding an apology when Micheal Jordan wasn't enshrined into the Basketball Hall of Fame as a Washington Wizard. Good god. They need to get over themselves. It's a fact not an opinion.  the Jewish temple is far more important than those mosques. those are just some mosques that got built there. but they are hardly the most sacred site in Islam. that's in Mecca. But the temple IS the most sacred site for Jews. so it's not fair and the Muslims need to back the fuck off. I mean it's their own fault for putting those mosques there back in the day. they probably thought the Jews would never return. but guess what they fucking did. so quit whining, shut the fuck up, and move your mosques. you have plenty more. I dont know why a bunch of muslims from another land thought they could take over the religious importance of a foreign country. this would be like if Buddhists built a temple in Rome and then 1 thousand years later they were complaining when Catholics wanted to move the temple, and Buddhists acted like they had always been in Rome and that they were more important than Catholics  For his next trick he should draw a cartoon of their favorite prophet and his 9 year old child bride.  It does not make sense to use historical facts to speak about our time's geopolitical structure.  If one does that, then it opens a big can of worms.  For example, the whole US was home to native Indians for a much longer period of time than that of Americans.  Much of Europe was under the Roman Empire boot for many eons.  Instanbul (ex Konstantinople) was Vyzantine etc.  Right now the temple mount is occupied by Muslims, i lt has a mosque on it, so if we admit in any other case that previous owners of lands don't have any rights to those lands now, we should also admit the same in this case as well.  Yes. this is true. let the third Temple be rebuild soon. Instead of fighting all these wars, we should take all that war money and build a giant spaceship for everyone who believes in magic books.  Imagine how much better off society would be. Jewish Telegraphic Agency is not a news source - it's a propaganda piece for the Israeli administration.  Adnan al-Husseini, the Palestinian Authoritys Jerusalem Affairs minister asked for an apology - not ""the Palestinians.""  Until a majority of Palestinians and Israelis agree to create an egalitarian state where equal rights and opportunities are provided to all citizens and no citizen should fear for their life because of their Religious association then the bigots on both sides can go fuck themselves.   Wow, 3000 years ago Jewish people lived in the area of Israel - it doesn't give you a right to invade and destroy the lives of people who have lived there for thousands of years since.   But equally, a stateless and cruelly attacked people should be able to have a state of their own. Both sides need to be adults about this instead of petulant greedy children.   While Palestinian terror groups/freedom fighters (depending on your view) have used despicable tactics it is pretty clear that the overwhelming use of unjust violence falls on the Israelis. This ethno-nationalist sentiment that is massively popular in Israel is testament to the stupidity of Humans in general. The Holocaust was caused by Ethno-nationalism and now the Jewish people in Israel, the biggest victims of that ideology, are turning into the very force they suffered from.   The climate in Israel shows me that as a race, Humans do not learn. If a Jewish community (of all people!) can so openly accept this rise of segregation and brutal oppression of minorities, then surely Europe and the US are not safe from the rebirth of true Fascism.   People telling me to shrug off Trump, Brexit, PiS, Front National, Jobbik/Fidesz, Golden Dawn, Svoboda and Fascist movements in Russia, Serbia, Austria, Sweden etc should all heed this warning. And worse, regardless of whether we elect right wing or left wing parties, they all seem so keen on spying on us and curbing our civil liberties. Circumventing our bills of rights or constitutional freedoms for their own monetary and political gain.   I really worry for the future. We might bring our kids into a dark and dangerous world... Perhaps it is best not to have children at all. Who gives a shit?  It was thousands of years ago.  I wish we would just irradiate the fucking thing so that nobody can go there for 10,000 years. It is the known site of the second temple, aka the temple of Herod, but what they are clinging to is the notion that the mount is the site of the first temple, aka ""the temple of Solomon"".  Here's the problem with that; there is not a shred of written or physical evidence that the first temple even existed, or that Solomon existed, outside of a few books of the old testament, which are full of outright falsehoods, and extreme exagerations that were compiled and edited only after the babylonian exile period. None of the texts which mention the temple existed when the temple suppossedly exist, and even then these texts are self-contradictory.  Even if the temple did exist, it  probably wasn't a site dedicated to the worship of yahweh, the traditional god of Judaism, but would have been a site dedicated to the worship of El and his consort Astarte/Asherah, or possibly to the worship of Baal Haddad, two other dieties of the great Canaanite pantheon.  There was probably little to no gold at the temple, certainly no golden altar, or candle sticks, or cherubim. It probably had a stone altar, a gilded statue of El upon the ark, and was painted throughout, not gilded - much like how we now know that Greek and egyptian temples were painted to the extreme.  If any site should claim to he the home to Judaism, it should be the temple sites at Tel Mot, or Mediggo, not the fabricated propaganda peice that the bible holds up.  ps - my opnion is that Jersualem should be an independant entity, free of Israel or Palestine, and internally regulated by the citizens thereof via direct democracy. they probably deny it is on earth also. I can't wait for Seleukid revivalists to overthrow the Israeli government. For fourty thousand years it was Volcae. I still havnt seen a lick of rent from any of these squatters. Does anyone know the UNESCO decision claiming the site is solely Islamic? That seems pretty weird, Jerusalem was home to the Jews for over a thousand years before Muhammad was even born O_o It's one of those inconvenient *hate facts*. History and facts have never stood in the way of these kinds of people. Now if they could only tear down that wall under the Al Aqsa Mosque that the Palestinians refuse to allow we might actually give further concrete proof of that and may even reveal the Holy of Holies. Now that may be. But I'm sure I can find some *""alternative facts""* that say otherwise. What's the alternate fact ? Paging Sean  The Palestinians never existed before in history. The are an illegitimate people. Amiright? Like the Jedi temple. That's not exactly a one off. A huge amount of chruches, mosques, and temples are built on the sites of previous holy sites. There's places with 5 or 6 layers of religious buildings. It's pretty par for the course for a new religion to build over the old one. The Jews did it too. Salty about a building built almost 1500 years ago. You must really hate the Jewish man who advised the caliph to build Al Aqsa where it stands till this day.  How often do you curse the Romans?  Historical proof of Islamic colonialism is offensive to Muslims. Because people like to think Palestine has the heritage right to the lands of Israel. > If anyone needs to apologize it is the Muslims for building that disgusting mosque right on top of the temple.  The Dome of the Rock and al Aqsa Mosque came MANY centuries after the Jewish Temple. But we can all share. And they are kinda cool.  I'm just wondering why the Palestinians want an apology. For what??? Stating historical facts? Demanding an apology for stating the fact that Temple Mount indeed was the site of the ancient Jewish temple is obviously ridiculous. But your statement is equally stupid. Those arent just some random mosques. The Dome of the Rock (not a mosque by the way) and al Aqsa Mosque mark the point from which Mohammed supposedly ascended into the heavens and are clearly very important holy sites in Islam, although not nearly as important as Mecca or Medina. They are also among the very oldest examples of Muslim religious architecture, making them part of our collective world heritage. The Jewish Temple on the other hand is gone and has been gone for a long time before Islam even came into being. The Jewish religion hasnt been centered around the temple cult for almost two thousand years. Tearing those sites down just to erect a new temple (that the Jewish religion clearly doesnt need any more) would be nothing but a crime. None of these sites are important. The entire old city should all be leveled and covered with concrete.  that'd be quite a blast eh? Why do you want to send David Copperfield into space? Getting rid of the undesirables of the week is the solution to all societal problems. Excellent thinking, citizen! President Trump smiles upon you. [About that..](https://youtu.be/n2RdSS4o88A?t=4s) and let them convert space and spread the faith? >This ethno-nationalist sentiment that is massively popular in Israel is testament to the stupidity of Humans in general.

If a Jewish community (of all people!) can so openly accept this rise of segregation and brutal oppression of minorities, then surely Europe and the US are not safe from the rebirth of true Fascism.  In other words: ""the Jews didn't learn the lessons of the Holocaust."" But we did.   The lesson we learned is that living as a minority isn't safe for us. Ever. Germany was seen as the most sophisticated, most liberal, most ""civilized"" country in the world before the World Wars. Jews had unprecedented freedoms in pre-Nazi Germany. But then the Nazis happened and half of the world's Jewish population was slaughtered while the rest of the world did nothing.  That is why we demand a Jewish nation-state. Europe taught us to rely on ourselves for our survival.  Which is why so few Jews support a binational single state. We might become a minority and that is an existential risk.  (And by the way, the majority of states in Eurasia are nation-states. Or in your language: ""ethno-nationalist."" Strange that only Israel is criticized for being one.) > Who gives a shit? It was thousands of years ago.  That is like saying who gives a shit if London has a connection to British people. Or who gives a shit if Beijing has a connection to Chinese people. Or who gives a shit if Mecca has a connection to the Muslim people.  The Temple Mount had a giant Jewish temple on it.. built by Herod the Great.. who was the Roman King of Judea in 19 BC. *Thats how long Jews have lived in Jerusalem.*  Now that it's even a question regarding the connection is kind of weird ....considering you can go **walk through and touch these old buildings**. They exist and the connection is real. Seriously? Imagine if the empire state building was declared a Canadian site. Americans would go absolutely ape shit and rightfully so  Don't worry, that's coming. It's written. My take on any religious site these ""old man in the sky"" loons are fighting over  You do realize one of the walls of that temple-that-never-existed is still standing. Any day now... Yes, the intent of the two UNESCO resolutions (which were both sponsored by Arab countries) was to designate the Temple Mount as a purely Islamic site, despite the fact that it was holy and central to Judaism for centuries before the birth of Islam.  >Hamas on Tuesday called UNESCOs formal adoption of a resolution effectively disregarding Jewish and Christian ties to Jerusalem a victory for the Palestinian people. ...  >A spokesman for the Gaza-based terror group Sami Abu Zuhri said in a statement that his group welcomes the resolutions wording to the effect that al-Aqsa is of purely Islamic heritage. He said the decision marks a victory for the Palestinian people.  http://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-calls-unesco-vote-on-jerusalem-victory-for-palestinians/  It's just another example of Palestinian diplomats misusing the United Nations, where they are able to wield disproportionate power due to the sheer number of Arab/Muslim-majority countries, to score points against Israel. You know, for a religion that's supposed to be non-idolatrous, they sure place a lot of importance on worshipping a fucking wall. pls unsubscribe me from hate facts What? Did you respond to the wrong person? Or like the One Ring, except, you know, the good side are the ones suffering.  where did the Jews do it? I understand what you're saying.  But we are talking about the holiest site in all of Judaism.  On that mount sat the holy of holies, where the literal spirit of god deigned to live on this Earth.  This isn't just some church or temple.  This is the literal seat of god and the holiest site in the entire religion. The Jewish *convert*, actually. He became Muslim. no facts please. we don't want any hurt feelings.  it wasn't even colonialism it was outright genocide, convert or die. Same happened in pakistan and afganisthan in the 1500s. Some of the most hardcore islamic people on the planet and they were forced converts.  that comment is a bit of a mindfuck  The Palestinians want jerusalem for themselves so they wanna pretend that Jews have nothing to do with Jerusalem and it belongs to them instead Al aqsa (the one moslems claim was where Muhammad *could* travel in one night) and the Temple can coexist spatially , but the Qubbat al-Sakhrah mosque is smack where the Temple should be. It has to be relocated. > But we can all share.   Unfortunately that sentiment hasn't been followed many times in past and even present - From Pagan temple in Mecca to Jewish temple of Jerusalem in the old times to Sandstone Buddha in Afghanistan and Pagan temples in Palmyra today.   Destroying signs of previous religions help them re-write the history and reduce chance of people questioning the validaty of their current religion or explore religions of their fore-fathers.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest_of_Mecca#Aftermath You might want to talk to all the Muslims who get super pissed when anyone but muslims try to pray at Al Aqsa. And all the jews that continually try to pray there despite it being more or less against the law. That one building could drive the whole region to craziness also, the muslims are real assholes in how they treat this situation. they whine about their buildings and then make fun of the Jews for wanting their own building, and they won't even let Jews onto the hill. even though it's in the Jewish city. It's insane that there is anywhere in Jerusalem that bans Jews from going. If the old testement Jews ever knew this would happen, they would go insane. anyway, Muslims need to stop being jerks about it, and then maybe I will respect their view more  well I still think it's unfair that a foreign religion was able to take over a city and prevent the holiest site from being rebuilt. What gave muslims the right to build there on top of the ruins? they say it's important now, but that's just a bunch of talk. where is the proof that Muhammed ascended to heaven in Jerusalem? and what was Muhammed even doing in Jerusalem? it always pissed me off that Muslims invaded that city and acted like they owned it. the natives were totally ignored and they acted like the Jewish religion never existed. They owe the jews for their very own religion cause Islam is a spinoff of Judaism. so they should show some respect. sorry, but I don't consider Muslim sites to be as important as the most sacred site for Jews. And I am not even Jewish, or even Christian. I just feel sorry for the Jews cause I understand how important that temple was to them. It was destroyed 2 times by foreign powers and they have been sad about it ever since.  because he's an alleged rapist Launch into sun. >But then the Nazis happened and half of the world's Jewish population was slaughtered while the rest of the world did nothing.  The world was involved in a pretty large-scale war at the time. > Germany was seen as the most sophisticated, most liberal, most ""civilized"" country in the world before the World Wars.  You think the Kaiserreich was liberal? Seriously?  Except Judaism isn't an ethnicity, but a religion. Don't confuse my anti-Israeli politics with antisemitism. It is intellectually dishonest.   I disagree with all ethno-nationalist nations if they pursue a campaign of imposed segregation or racial prejudice . Almost all nations are born of bloodshed and oppression. Israel is simply a very prescient example and in many ways an ironic one. This constant existential fear is no way to build a modern mindset. In western nations (themselves responsible for some of the worst crimes in history) the Jewish minorities are not only well integrated and protected but also wealthy. The same cannot be said for other equally oppressed and historically stateless peoples.   What of the Kurds? What of the Roma? The Roma who were freed from Chattel Slavery *later* than African Americans, who were segregated and slaughtered in similar style to Jewish people, who were all but exterminated and now are forced to live in third world conditions without access to clean water in Europe *today*. Where was their massive international nation building project?  There wasn't one.   I don't blame Jewish people for second for this and I understand you could level the accusation of ""whataboutery"" at me if you wish although I find that comparing and contrasting similar historical and sociological paths is actually helpful.  My main point is this: Israel has gone far past ""relying on ourselves for survival"". Israel is a racist, apartheid state. I say this in the knowledge that people like Denis Goldberg fought with everything they had to end the apartheid in South Africa. Jewish people around the world have fought for anti-racist and anti-apartheid movements. Jewish people have traditionally been the engine behind enlightenment philosophy in Europe, and many were the great thinkers who started the Socialist movements (which held the first Workers day, the first Womans day, the first nation to legalise homosexuality was a Socialist one etc).  So why, then, do you find it to be a defensible position to defend the racist, apartheid state of Israel? It shames the historical defiance to oppression that Jewish figures across the world have espoused and fought for.  And Solomon's Temple stood there before that. That's more than three thousand years of Jewish history on that mount. > The Temple Mount had a giant Jewish temple on it  Right, and it doesn't any more.  It's time to get over it. >Thats how long Jews have lived in Jerusalem.  And the vast majority of them became Muslim Palestinians. Because history is not worth preserving? Religion was a major part of human culture since prehistory, so it makes sense a large part of ancient places are related in a way to religion. Destroying all religious places will mean the destruction of a huge chunk of history. Even though it's claimed to be from the first temple, there is no proof that there was a temple there - a customary name is not evidence. That's actually just the retaining wall for the Second Temple Complex. We can't find evidence for the first Temple because archaeology in and around the Temple Mount is heavily restricted by the Waqf in order to prevent Palestinian violence Edit: I was wrong. We already have physical evidence of the First Temple. That doesn't change the fact that the walls that Jews are allowed to pray at are the retaining walls for the Second Temple complex. And they only pray there because Jews aren't actually allowed to pray where the Temple itself stood. It's worth mentioning that the former UN chief Ban Ki Moon and the  UNESCO director-general Irina Bokova rejected that UNESCO resolution   >UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon distanced himself on Sunday from a recent UNESCO resolution which failed to acknowledge the ties between the Jewish people and the Temple Mount.  >UNESCO director-general Irina Bokova has already distanced herself from the resolution, [...] Bokova further repeated her statements from April, July and this week that ""the Old City of Jerusalem is the sacred city of the three monotheistic religionsJudaism, Christianity and Islam, and that Jewish (sic), Christians and Muslims have a right to the explicit recognition of their history and relationship with the city.""  http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4866955,00.html Jordan should decide on a nice place to put the mosque, and then transfer it brick by brick like we've done for many historical buildings. There there's no more problem. That mosque is third most important to them, but the Temple Mount is the single most important to Jews, and predates the mosque by centuries upon centuries. That's an ignorant statement, it's like saying the same thing with Islam and the Kabba. A holy place is a site for a religion to commune with god. Did you know that the Joos are evil?    *Do you wish to continue with hate facts?* No but that's how these circle jerks always end up. Nowhere and never but shhh it's good relativism...   Literally the entire Promised Land, aka modern Israel? It's part of the Torah, where Yahweh orders the Hebrews to kill every man, woman, child, and all livestock in the Promised Land. The Gibeonites get out of it through trickery. Any previous pagan holy sites maybe?  Those Damn Romans! The Keepers of the Holy Grudge. I thought if your mother was Jewish, you're perma-Jewish?  *downvotes for asking a question? Stay classy hivemind. >Actually, there are literally dozens of thousand-year old prayers, in every service, asking God to rebuild the temple. Literally every day for millennia Jews have asked to rebuild the temple.  And?   > but saying the Jews didn't care about the Temple   Didn't say that.  > are pissed at the Romans  They are.   > is the height of ignorance.  Putting a lie before a true statement doesn't make bot things true. >it wasn't even colonialism it was outright genocide, convert or die.  Sorry, this is not true at all. Otherwise there still wouldn't be Christian communities and churches in many parts of the West Bank for instance.  And to add insult to injury to exterminate the Jews and treat the ones who haven't been found out yet as second class citizens.  There's even some debate as to whether or not Mohammad actually went to Jerusalem in that event. > You might want to talk to all the Muslims who get super pissed when...   Jews need police escorts to visit Al Aqsa. ABSOLUTELY no bullshit. [Because this happens] (https://youtu.be/KVpBLjjOZzI). Those ideas are not mutually exclusive  Actually no Christians try to pray at all Aqsa, only the edgiest of Jews who defy their own religious law go to AL Aqsa.  http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/Rabbis-warn-Jews-against-going-to-Temple-Mount  The destruction of AL Aqsa signals the start of the Apocalypse in Islam. I agree, there are plenty of Muslims behaving in absolutely unacceptable ways toward Jews that clearly hold Temple Mount in great regard. There is nothing to defend about such behavior. But we should also remember that not all Muslims do so. So blaming and maybe even punishing them all isnt just in any way. In an ideal world both groups should be able to access that place and worship without being harassed by members of the other. It is very unfortunate that we dont live in such a world (yet?). Of course there is no proof that Muhammad ever ascended into the heavens from Jerusalem. There is also no proof that God ever sent Ten Commandments to earth that were later kept inside the temple in Jerusalem. But none of that matters. Temple Mount is clearly a holy site for believers of those two religions. There can hardly be an argument about that fact. Equally clear is that the Jewish Temple is gone and that Judaism has adapted accordingly. Rabbinic Judaism is very different from the religion practiced in Judea in Roman times and simply doesnt require a temple any more.  The Dome of the Rock and al Aqsa Mosque on the other hand are very important to Islam as it is practiced today and they are also monuments of incredible historic and artistic value. Tearing them down would be as atrocious as the destruction of the Jewish Temple has been. [The Allies knew about the concentration / death camps and could have bombed them - saving potentially millions of Jewish lives from being exterminated there - but refused to.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_bombing_debate) We know that they could have if they wanted to, because the Americans bombed factories *adjacent* to camps! For its time and place, yea. It was. the weimar republic was very liberal, one of the most liberal places in europe in terms of arts, ideas and sexuality. Except Judaism is an [ethnoreligious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnoreligious_group) national identity, not a religion.   (*See* [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews) (""Jewish ethnicity, nationhood and religion are strongly interrelated, as Judaism is the traditional faith of the Jewish nation""), and [here](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/are-jews-a-nation-or-a-religion) (""Of course, Judaism is a religion, and it is this religion that forms the central element of the Jewish culture that binds Jews together as a nation"") for example, if you won't take my word as a Jew as sufficiently authoritative.) Using the Holocaust as a rhetorical tool to claim that Jews did not learn its lessons is antisemitic; this is because it is bigoted to leverage a group's oppression against it, to 'splain as a non-Jew what the proper lessons Jews should learn would have been.   Jews were very wealthy and well-integrated in pre-WW2 Germany. The lesson we learned is that wealth and integration in the most liberal state of the age *isn't enough*.  ______  It is antisemitic to oppose the existence of the Jewish nation-state (and no other nation-state) because it was established through violent means, even though (as you yourself admit!) ""almost all nations are born of bloodshed and oppression.""   If you're going to oppose the existence of Israel because of its violent beginnings, then you should oppose the existence of all similar nation-states with violent beginnings (hint: all of them). Opposing only Israel on that ground is an unjustified double standard, and therefore bigoted, and therefore antisemitic.  _______  The Kurds are currently building their nation-state through violence. In fact, multiple groups of Kurds are committing multiple forms of violence in multiple currently-existing countries, some of whom are even designated as terrorist groups by NATO.  The Romani had a movement to form a *Romanestan* starting in the 1930s but largely decided against it in the 1990s. Which is something the Romani nation has the right to do - but was not something that the Jewish nation was willing to do. *See* [The Roma  a Nation without a State? Historical Background and Contemporary Tendencies](http://www.academia.edu/1132671/The_Roma_a_Nation_without_a_State_Historical_Background_and_Contemporary_Tendencies):  >>The Kwiek dynasty was something totally new in Gypsy history. It was closely related to the ideas about an independent state, *Romanestan* (land of the Roma). Initiatives were taken in search for territory for the state. In 1934 the newly elected Gypsy king Jozef Kwiek sent a delegation to the United Nations to ask for land in Southern Africa (namely Namibia) so the Gypsies could have their own state there. At the same time the alternative king Michal II Kwiek traveled to India in order to specify the location of the future Gypsy state (somewhere along the shores of the river Ganges). After his trip he began to support the idea that the state should be in Africa (namely Uganda) and traveled to Czechoslovakia and England to seek support for his idea. In 1936 the next king, heir to Joseph, Janusz Kwiek, sent a delegation to Mussolini asking for some land in Abyssinia (at that time occupied by Italy) where the Gypsies could have their own state.^14  >>The process of searching for a place for the Gypsies in European integration saw the emergence of the concept of the Roma as a trans[border]-national minority.29 This concept was introduced for the first time at the meeting in Ostia near Rome (Italy) in 1991^30 At that time a lot of hope for improving the social status of the Gypsies and solving their numerous problems in Central and Eastern Europe, which appeared or were aggravated as a result of the hard period of transition, was directed towards international law and the European institutions in particular. ... The concept of the Roma as a nation without a state was suggested and developed in many articles by a non-Roma, Paolo Pietrosanti from Italy, an influential member of the Transradical party.31 He was co-opted in the IRU leadership (even though it was not very clear how this happens) as early as the mid 90s. After the fifth congress of IRU in July 2000 in Prague, this concept became the leading one.  >>Not all Gypsies lost the desire for an independent state. For example, in Poland in the beginning of the 90s many periodicals published the suggestion that Kaliningrad district (the former Knigsberg) be given to the Gypsies for their own state. The Bulgarian press quoted Gypsy leaders saying that a Gypsy state can be created in Dobrudja, in the borderland between Rumania and Bulgaria. The Gypsy activist Nicolae Bobu in Rumania, who is also a lawyer, is suing the Rumanian state in order to make a legitimate Gypsy state from a small rural piece of land purchased by several Gypsy families. The representative of Bulgaria in the IRU Parliament after returning home from the congress in Prague, gave a press statement, that one of the decisions of the congress is to create a Roma state between India and Egypt.^33 The most well formed concept is the position of a well-known Roma leader, the head of an international Roma organization, an alternative to IRU. In a number of unofficial comments he situated the future Roma state in Macedonia and outlined long-term strategies for the future geopolitical development of the Balkans. During the Kosovo crisis in 1999-2000 numerous rumors were circulating (unofficially) about the preparation of para-military Roma forces somewhere on the Balkans (without any real basis).  _____  Israel is not a racist state. Nation-states are not inherently racist, and Israel itself is not country markedly more racist than other Eurasian nation-states or American civic states; if you'd like me to provide some comparisons between how the USA treats its black citizens and how Israel treats its Arab citizens, I'd be happy to oblige.   Israel is not an apartheid state. Prolonged military occupation of a foreign people during war is not apartheid. If Israel were, for example, to fully annex Area C of the West Bank and give Areas A and B limited independent self-rule, *that would be apartheid*. Areas A & B would be bantustans. I would violently protest that.  Thankfully the Israeli left is working on taking control of the country from Bibi ""maintain-the-status-quo-and-hope-for-the-best"" Netanyahu and is planning on [unilaterally withdrawing from the whole West Bank, except the major settlement blocs and annexed East Jerusalem, and recognizing a fully-independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza.](http://www.jewishvoicesnj.org/news/2016-02-17/Mideast/Labor_approves_Herzogs_plan_for_West_Bank_withdraw.html)  Israel is a normal state with normal problems, with the same kind of internal politics and social conflicts that many European parliamentary democracies have, and with the same kind of international land conflicts that Morocco and Turkey and Armenia and Russia and China have. Israel isn't the most liberal state in the world. It's not the best state in the world. But it's our homeland, our only place to exercise self-determination, the only place where we are in control of our own security. > Right, and it doesn't any more. It's time to get over it.  Does to. Part of that original Temple still stands and it's called the Western Wall which is considered the holiest place in Judaism. Google Western Wall you'll see tons of pictures. The wall is like 2200 years old.  Edit: Jews have been living in Jerusalem since basically the 19th century BC. This is an artifact from that era. Al Aqsa and the dome of the rock can always be leveled.  How can they build a second temple without there being a first temple? There are [some evidence](https://templemount.wordpress.com/2016/10/14/archaeological-proof-of-the-jewish-temples-on-the-temple-mount/) that the second temple was built on top of the first. Ban Ki Moon also bashed the UN on his way out for the disproportionate and unreasonable focus on Israel when there are so many greater issues in this world.  I mean, that's kinda why they built a temple there though. It's a very common practice historically speaking.  Not that this makes it right of course but yeah, cultures and religions regularly appropriate significant sites, holidays, rituals and traditions so they can assimilate their competition. It's not in the building though. The holy part of the temple mount is not the building. It's the land it's on. [The place on earth that Mohammad ascended to heaven at.](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IqhlJPhgxVI/VD7hUiyBfCI/AAAAAAAAAnM/45a1Hkdt0RY/s1600/Captura.JPG). It's not even really a mosque there as the important feature. The real reason they fight tooth and nail for it is the round building preserving and protecting the rocky outcropping they believe that abraham was going to sacrifice his son at as well, The Dome of the Rock. Moving the building and moving the rock doesn't change that it was the actual coordinates.   Even though the Jewish folk do have a preceding claim, history and time have rendered that place holy for a lot more then just Jewish folk in an irreversible way(as explained above). It would be nice if they could share the area amenably, but that's probably not going to happen. > , but the Temple Mount is the single most important to Jews  Yah don't say? And here I was thinking it's a slice of Palestine, gratis. Silly me. They are talking to themselves. It's idiotic that anyone spends a second of time fighting for any of these places on both sides.  > it's like saying the same thing with Islam and the Kabba.  Indeed it is.  What the hell do they need to worship that box for when God is supposed to be everywhere or something?  Both religions are inconsistent, hypocritical bullshit, like Abrahamic religions in general. No pls unsubscribe  So when you have nothing substantial to say you just invent conversations that never happened just so you'll have someone to argue with? Sounds like something you can do by yourself in the corner. Well the majority of Jews don't act on that and Israel was purchased legally. The Muslims on the other hand don't recognize that the dispicablly violent parts of the Quran should be ignored.  Funny enough, that's one of the passages of the Torah we know to be absolutely untrue historically. The Egyptians made written records that showed that the Canaanites and the Israelites were the same people. They simply changed their tribal name and faith during the Egyptian occupation as their culture was impacted by its resistance against Egypt. No thanks, those are usually on some windy hill out of town and who wants to shelp all the way out there every week? What did they ever do for us? Sort of. It's complicated. If a Jewish person joins another religion (with only one unique exception) then they're essentially leaving. They're *technically* Jewish but considered ""lost"" and *functionally* no longer Jewish.  Jewish converts to other religions are easily able to come back though. They don't even need to perform any conversion rituals or anything. They can just start being Jewish again.  Their children might be technically Jewish, but unless those children can conclusively prove Jewish matrilineal descent (which is very rare) they would need to convert - because they might *not* be technically Jewish. But if they were technically Jewish *and could prove it to a [beit din](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beit_din)* then they could just rejoin without conversion. it is true, the same happened in India as well and europe during islamic invasions Literally using absolutes when you provide a single link.... Of people chanting. I've been to AL Aqsa and seen Jews walking around without police. Good job internet detective. If you want to compare what the Arabs are chanting with what Jews chant on Jerusalem day, the Arabs seems like saints.  *2016 Saw more Israeli Jewish incursion in Al Aqsa than any year since Israel and Jordan signed and agreement between the governments after Israels occupation of East Jerusalem in 1967.  http://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=774680 New accounts spouting anti-Palestinian propaganda are a daily occurance on r/worldnews these days. First post equates Palestinians (not Hamas but the entire population) with ISIS.   See you on your new account tomorrow, oh brave bigot. normally I would agree about preserving ancient buildings. but there is something about Islam that just bugs me. there are countless plotholes in the religion that don't really make sense. I find myself more sympathetic to a native religion because I have always sympathized with the native faiths anytime 2 religions clash. even in medieval europe with the pagans. And also, Islam has destroyed countless artifacts and buildings of other religions. so this would be karmic justice. I am still mad at all the artifacts that ISIS has destroyed in Iraqi musuems. And when the Taliban blew up Buddhist statues. Islam does not respect the past, so why should we respect their past? I kinda see it as revenge if those temple mount buildings ever get razed to the ground. Wow you're saying the allies were complicit in the holocaust? Crazy. At most it's an international religious caste.  But Russian Jews aren't the same people as Moroccan Jews. Actually, Israel is not the only nation state I oppose. You can hurl accusations of Antisemitism at me all you want, it doesn't change the fact that the way Israel is settling Palestine is *not* normal and not healthy. It is an apartheid, racist state. Just like Jim Crow America was (and in some ways still is), just like South Africa was.   Also, the Roma have never been given widespread support for their cause, same with the Kurds.   Personally, I believe that the end of the Volkerwanderung (or Migration Period) which saw the disparate, non-ethnic based nations formulate into larger nations based on united ethnicity, was one of the most destructive turns in human history, chronically understudied. Before this, nations were not organised on the idea of ""one people"" but geographic location. Nations like this that existed longer into history are places like Germany (when it was a federation of states) and Italy (before it formed into Italy). We saw the result of these politics and we are seeing it again.  Perhaps you are correct in bringing up Morocco as an example. Morocco is strikingly similar in its attacks on the Sahara.   However, just because Jewish people have historically been marginalised, brutalised and worse, does not give Israel (certainly not the representation of all Jewish people in the world) free reign to obliterate and murder tens of thousands of civilians.   There needs to be an egalitarian, one state solution. Or a peaceful two state solution.  Funny how the regressives say support someone's right to religious freedom but don't acknowledge that the Muslim religion is not spread through democratic peaceful means. Everyone's given religious freedom unless you're an Israeli Jew because if you are you're automatically part of the Zionist colonialist imperialist movement into the backward wasteland of the Palestinian Territories. The BDS movement and Rodger Waters' support of it put a Star of David on a pig and used it as a vocal point for the lie filled Palestinian cause.  [removed] Indeed, except Rabbinical Judaism isn't even the same religion as ancient Hebrew Yahwism.  That religion died along with the priesthood and the temple. I never even thought about it that simplisticly. It also doesn't counter the other artifacts showing a Jewish presence there at the appropriate time. The sneaky joos have manipulated math into a zionist conspiracy! He supported the resolutions, he just thought the volume at the UNGA was disproportionate. He never once stopped condemning the illegal colonization of Palestine.  You mean like how Arab countries all want to destroy Israel, and subjugate their Jewish citizens? Because that would somehow make it less holy to the Jews? You're right, silly you.  Because even the most religious of people want something of this world that ""proves"" what they believe. Because the effort of getting to such a place shows what people are willing to do to prove their faith.   It's not idolatry, it's seen as a symbol of commitment. Of course it's hypocritical, I'm not going to deny that at all. However you're trying to apply logic onto humans, which have proved time and time again how ILLOGICAL we really are. It's just funny that when you read this thread it's full of people making generalizations of Palestinians and calling for the destruction of the al Aqsa mosque and it's a worse version of what the person said in the article.  aka most of the Koran I wasn't mentioning anything in particular but pagans also built temples in cities . Well, there *are* aqueducts.  Genocide is the intentional systematic extermination of a whole group of people. If forces were killing en mass but they left some people of that group alone, it is not really genocide but mass murder.  Educated guess is you don't live in Israel- Jews can no longer walk around the Temple Mount freely as they get attacked -- good job internet detective... >Islam does not respect the past  How bad did you fail your history class? The only reason modern society is aware of Aristotle and the great philosophers is because Islam preserved and translated the Greek texts. Meanwhile the Western world was trapped in the dark ages. But keep equating all of Islam with the Taliban. Very enlightened of you. ""Plot holes"" in the religion? Do all pagan myths make sense to you? Or all Jewish, Christian or Buddhist ones? Who even cares if they make sense? Nobody is demanding of you that you convert to Islam.  I am also sympathetic towards Jews that simply want to peacefully worship at one of their most holy sites. But Im much less sympathetic towards religious extremists who are trying to destroy historic sites of great value. The monuments on Temple Mount arent just part of the Muslim past. Theyre world heritage sites. The concept that sites of historic and artistic importance are part of our collective heritage and worth preserving because of that doesnt seem to be lost on you considering that you care about the monuments of Palmyra or Bamyan although youre neither Pagan nor Buddhist. What you propose is just one of the dumbest iterations of ""an eye for an eye"" in which youd make all of us a little blinder. You'd make all of us poorer in some misguided attempt to take revenge, to make an ideological point. Tell me, in which regard is what you'd do any better than what ISIS or the Taliban did in Palmyra or Bamyan? I dont see much of a difference. And Im not sure if ISIS would even care considering theyre also targeting Muslim holy sites. I on the other hand as well as many others, Muslim and non Muslim alike, would be shocked if anything would happen to the buildings on Temple Mount. No idea why youd want to punish us all for crimes we certainly didnt commit, while those that did commit them might not even mind. Maybe you shouldnt treat Muslims as some kind of homogenous collective that equally shares the blame for the actions of individual groups. Tragic historical fact Both groups recognize each other as part of the same Jewish nation. Jews worldwide have always considered ourselves to be a single nation.  Don't goysplain. Don't speak over Jews when we tell you how we self-identify. What you think we are is irrelevant. > Actually, Israel is not the only nation state I oppose.  Which other nation-states do you oppose? Is it ""all of the ones that were founded on violence""?  >ou can hurl accusations of Antisemitism at me all you want, it doesn't change the fact that the way Israel is settling Palestine is not normal and not healthy. It is an apartheid, racist state. Just like Jim Crow America was (and in some ways still is), just like South Africa was.  One more time: *prolonged military occupation of a foreign people during war is not apartheid*.  >Also, the Roma have never been given widespread support for their cause, same with the Kurds.  Jews a century ago didn't (and Kurds today don't) receive ""widespread support"" for their nationalism.  >Before this, nations were not organised on the idea of ""one people"" but geographic location.  [Citation Needed]  Jews in the Roman Empire (and many other peoples subjugated by the Romans, like Egyptians) maintained their ""national"" identity under the Empire, even if they had Roman citizenship, even if individuals traveled throughout the Empire.  >Nations like this that existed longer into history are places like Germany (when it was a federation of states) and Italy (before it formed into Italy).  Some national identities are relatively young (German, Italian, Palestinian). Some are very old (Chinese, Egyptian, Jewish).  >Perhaps you are correct in bringing up Morocco as an example. Morocco is strikingly similar in its attacks on the Sahara.  Thank you.  >However, just because Jewish people have historically been marginalised, brutalised and worse, does not give Israel (certainly not the representation of all Jewish people in the world) free reign to obliterate and murder tens of thousands of civilians.  To place the blame of the conflict solely on Israel's shoulders is incorrect. A cycle of violence developed, starting with antisemitic and Arab-nativist pogroms in the 1920s, and we've been trapped in it ever since.  I place a lot of blame on England and France: if not for Sykes-Picot, the [1919 Faisal-Weizmann Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faisal%E2%80%93Weizmann_Agreement) could have avoided the whole violent conflict.  >There needs to be an egalitarian, one state solution. Or a peaceful two state solution.  So support the Israeli left.   Like the Zionist Union and Herzog, who wants to take a radical step towards two states by unilaterally withdrawing from much of the West Bank. This would end the military occupation and demonstrate to both the Palestinians and the world that Israel is willing to do what it must for peace. > I understand it perfectly. You worship bricks and mortar.  I'm not on your case I'm just trying to make you understand the connection between Jews the Temple mount AND Jerusalem.  The pyramids are brick-and-mortar but they have a significance and connection to the Egyptian people. Same with the castle in London.. and the Forbidden City in China.. and the Taj Mahal in India... it's historical record of a people's connection to a place *.. in brick and mortar.* I'm a Jewish atheist, but still it it obviously shows that Jews have a legitimate right to live in Israel and that the Jewish people have a connection to the land, to me it's a culture and spiritual connection. To me going to the Western Wall isn't to worship bricks and mortar, but it's a cool place where I can learn more about Judaism and it's history, and it kinda puts it in perspective for me that Jews have lived in that spot for thousands of years.  Don't get so emotional, broseph. Did I say anything about settlements? To be frank? Even as a supporter of Israel myself, the Transfer from the originally migrant Palestinian control to Israeli formation was not done in the best  or most courteous way, and constant encroachment into the palestinian areas/siezure of the former palestinian state by Israel should raise some questions. Just because they're a state of people who were catagorically sought to be executed during WW2 doesn't erase their scrutiny against others. The problem itself lies in the fact that they didn't just go settling a ""no man's land"" during this ""zion exodus"" after WW2. The US and Britain just decided to hand them the land over the opinions of natives, which would cause anyone issue. Just because they were there hundreds of years ago doesn't give them time immemorial claim to the area, Or else we would be ceeding land to the Native Americans left and right because THEY were here hundreds of years before any of us immigrants.  Plus it doesn't matter how many Muslim countries want to ""Destroy"" israel in your terms. Some states want them to be forced to return to the initial borders and for the palestinian state to be recognized, others don't recognize them at all. There's actually a big minority of muslim supporters of Israel, and it's incorrect to label them all just because muslim countries don't support them currently. In fact, many if not most Israeli Arabs believe that Israel has the right to exist, though most believe the state should be secular, or largely muslim. 48% of those people believe that Israel should exist as a self governing Jewish state. This is not insignificant. Educate yourself: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_supporters_of_Israel There are plenty of places important to Arabs and muslims in Israel. That doesn't make them Palestinian:  It's straight up idolatry.  When you say that so-and-so object is irreplaceably holy, then that's what you've got. But the comment you responded to had none of that. Theres pleanty of vile discussion going on here, what you responded to above was not part of that. I really know nothing and was just making a joke. when the mass murder is in millions, it might as well be a genocide. The word doesn't matter, the action does. What an education! So which part of Israel do you live in, since you are claiming the expertise to dismiss my comment.  More Israeli Jews went to Al Aqsa this year than any since 1967, when the Israeli government agreed it would maintain a status quo. ** http://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=774680 I know about the texts. but modern islam has devolved. I don't care if it's not every muslim that does it. it's muslim thinking that drives the terrorists to destroy pagan artifacts.  well maybe I'm just a hypocrite, cause at the same time as not caring about the temple mount muslim buildings, I am mad at Saudi Arabia for bulldozing everything in Mecca to build hotels. And those were muslim sites. So go figure. I just don't care about the temple mount stuff cause it's in a foreign land it doesn't belong in. In Jerusalem, the muslims were invaders and had no business there. nobody gave them permission to build on the temple mount. as for the plot holes, I am referring to the idea that Allah would give his third most perfect message to a bunch of foreign Arabs, while he apparently gave his imperfect first message to his own chosen people in their homeland. I don't get why Muhammed was more important to Allah than Moses, when Moses was a Hebrew. Their origin story of the religion makes no sense, and franky I feel that Muhmammed just made it all up. I'm more likely to be sympathetic to Jews cause the religion probably developed more naturally and is still in line with their tribal customs. Islam is something invented and steals from another culture.  >Both groups recognize each other as part of the same Jewish nation.  Which is meaningless - it's like Muslims in Indonesia considering themselves part of the same nation as Saudis.    They just loosely belong to the same religion.  They don't even belong to the same branches of the religion, but to Sephardic and Ashkenazi sects, which were separated by well over 1000 years.  > Don't speak over Jews when we tell you how we self-identify. What you think we are is irrelevant.  Yeah bullshit.  It's every bit other people's business when it affects international relations. I agree with you that many of the root causes come from Britain and France's history in the region. Indeed, the Arab Nationalism that caused attacks on Israel and played into the hands of Dictators in Iraq and Syria was fueled by the actions of the Imperial European powers. The fundamentalism destroying the middle east is funded by the US via Saudi Arabia.   The nation states I oppose differ depending on the question asked. In theory the entire idea of the nation state does little but perpetuate violence, and a system similar to a mixture of ideas by Murray Bookchin and Rosa Luxemburg would be my preference - with a few personal addendums as I'm sure we all have .   However, in realpolitik terms it is probably easier to list the governments I do not find corrupt and appalling. Scandinavian nations and New Zealand have (for the faults they do possess) created relatively transparent and amiable democracies compared to the sickening thieves in control of most western nations, bowing to corporate influences to line their own pockets. Politicians should choose to have their responsibility as a result of their convictions, not their personal aims.  The World powers are the largest sponsors of terrorism on this planet, and they ruthlessly propagandise against ""rogue"" states who dare to do as the ""big boys"" do. Global politics is a brutal sham filled with power plays and the people who suffer are innocent civilians. Children being bombed in their schools, mothers being gunned down in the street.   I understand your point of view and sympathise to a certain extent. However, the sheer disparity in the force being used and the casualty rates for Israel and Palestine dispels the concept of it being a ""war"". It is a prolonged and politically motivated massacre and seizure of land. That isn't to say that I automatically assume the Palestinian cause is just and right either. Both sides have done despicable things and there needs to be a real international forum to get things done peacefully - otherwise both belligerents should ideally be sanctioned to within an economic inch of their lives. The way both Israel and Palestine have dealt with this issue is not acceptable.  In terms of what is realistically achievable I have no ill will to those like you who are trying to get a peaceful solution out of a violent situation. Lessons should be learnt from Northern Ireland. This is a subject close to my heart - people I know have lost family in Northern Ireland from all sides of the conflict including the brutality of British soldiers and British sponsored paramilitary groups, while I live near a town bombed by the IRA where innocent civilians were blown to pieces for no reason.   You can only find peace when you are willing to sit around the negotiating table and concede some things, while gaining some things. You can't have it all one way. Israel's actions in Palestine are unacceptable from a human standpoint. There is no ""get out of jail free"" card here.   [removed] How old is Isral ?  More specific question, were'nt there Jewish people living with muslims in old Palestine before WW2 ?  Edit :  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine The settlements and illegal annexation of Jerusalem are the reason for all these resolutions. Israel is illegally administering these areas.  I think we are going to have to agree to disagree on this one. On a serious sidenote , Jerusalem wasn't founded by Jews, so are some of the sacred jewish sites also built upon someone else's sacred site?  > I don't care if it's not every muslim that does it.   Oh, okay. Just straight up proud of your bigotry. Bonjour  I very much appreciate that you see the contradictions in your position. And yes, sure, the Dome of the Rock and al Aqsa Mosque were build relatively shortly after the Arab armies had conquered Jerusalem, a city that hadnt been Muslim before that. On the other hand at this point it hadnt been Jewish for quite a long time either. Under Roman rule Jews werent even allowed to enter Jerusalem  after their two failed revolts. It were the Arabs who let them back into the city. That they claimed Temple Mount for themselves and their own religion may seem insensible from a modern perspective, but it wasnt out of the ordinary for antiquity at all. According to Jewish tradition the Jews themselves had to conquer Jerusalem from the pagan Jebusites before they could even build their first temple there and they didnt think twice about how their predecessors would think about that. They certainly didnt ask anyone for permission. And who even knows who the Jebusites might have displaced even before that. Considering this, returning Temple Mount to some kind of original owner would be a pointless effort.  And no matter how moral or immoral all those different conquests of the past may seem to you, you certainly cant blame current generations for them. Punishing modern Muslims by destroying some of their most sacred sites simply wouldnt be just.  Im also not sure why you chose to single out Islam for its supposed inconsistencies. Surely you could ask similar questions about plenty other religions. Furthermore its not unusual for one religion to borrow aspects from another. And I dont know about you but I as an unbeliever consider every religion a human construct. There is no such thing as a natural religion. > Which is meaningless - it's like Muslims in Indonesia considering themselves part of the same nation as Saudis.  They could. And if they did, then they would be one nation. But they don't, so they aren't.  >They just loosely belong to the same religion. They don't even belong to the same branches of the religion, but to Sephardic and Ashkenazi sects, which were separated by well over 1000 years.  Sephardi and Ashkenazi aren't ""sects,"" they're different diaspora communities with very mildly different traditions.  >Yeah bullshit. It's every bit other people's business when it affects international relations.  No. A non-Jew has no right to tell Jews that we aren't a nation - and just the same, non-Palestinians have no right to tell Palestinians that they aren't a nation.   I will no longer engage with you, because your insistence on speaking over Jews about Jewish self-identification and self-determination is antisemitic. I don't engage with antisemites. > I stand by my opinion that we should just irradiate the whole damn place and be done with it.  One day you should go to Jerusalem.. it's pretty far out ..it's like Raiders of the Lost Ark in places.  And it's worked pretty good under Israeli control for 70 years now. People from all over the world come to visit everyday. There aren't any Jews running around ramming bus stops or stabbing people. I would hate to see half of it turn into another Gaza.. that would be awful. Not peacefully. Palestinians pogromed Jews (including anti-Zionist Jews) in [Jerusalem 1920](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1920_Nebi_Musa_riots), then in [Jaffa 1921](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1921_Jaffa_riots), then in [Hebron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Hebron_massacre) and [Safed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Safed_riots) and [Jerusalem 1929](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Palestine_riots). That's before WW2.  Do you want information about pogroms before WW1? No. That would likely create problems for the idolatry prohibitions. Even being located on a site where idolatry was performed would've been problematic.  Jerusalem was founded by Jews (ethnicity) but not necessarily Jews (faith). It was a Canaanite city in the heartland of the Canaanite tribes who would come to call themselves Israelites, and Judaism (faith) constitutes a transformation of the Canaanite religion into a monotheistic one over many long periods of social strife. it's not fair that they get to build their stuff on holy ruins of the temple and then whine when Jews come back and want to use that spot again. nobody told them to build there. it's their own fault.  well anyway, there are some theories that say the whole Jewish exodus never happened. That they were always in that area and just changed their beliefs and then later on they retconned history and made up a story about how they used to wander before they ended up in Israel. There is evidence that the Hebrews used to believe in many gods, and that really the ancient Hebrews and the Caannites that they hated were one and the same. At some point some Caananites changed to worship just one God and called themselves Hebrews. and then they displaced the original religion and created Judaism. We do know that the part about Egypt never happened. there is no physical evidence for Hebrews ever being enslaved in Egypt, and no record of it in Egyptian history. if a pharoh had literally died while chasing after slaves, it would have been big news. anyway my point is that I think the Jews always lived in the area and it was just a change in religion that happened in their society. but no migration or conqueroring of the city happened  >They could. And if they did, then they would be one nation. But they don't, so they aren't.  Something something global caliphate. Its nothing but a load of semantics.  The very notion of a 'nation' is a modern one.  >Sephardi and Ashkenazi aren't ""sects,"" they're different diaspora communities with very mildly different traditions.  Same difference.  >A non-Jew has no right to tell Jews that we aren't a nation  They have every right in the world when that 'nation' invades a foreign country on this pretext of nationhood when it's full of other people who happen to be far more descended from the ancient locals than the invaders.  >I will no longer engage with you, because your insistence on speaking over Jews about Jewish self-identification and self-determination is antisemitic. I don't engage with antisemites.  Your opinion on who is antisemitic and what is antisemitism isn't worth a wet fart in a dry summer.   > One day you should go to Jerusalem.. it's pretty far out ..it's like Raiders of the Lost Ark in places.  Oh I'd love to go. >it's not fair   The Israeli government agreed to it.   >. nobody told them to build there. it's their own fault.   Literally a Jewish man who converted to Islam told the caliph to build Al Aqsa at it's location. Again, you need to review history. The Exodus from Egypt to the Holy Land and the conquest of Jerusalem are two different things happening at different times and are narrated in different books of the Old Testament. But sure, they both still might not have actually happened, considering there is almost no independent material backing up those older parts of the Jewish canon. But it still shows that the Israelites were perfectly fine with the displacement of older religions as long as they were the ones displacing people. Later, better documented parts of ancient Jewish history dont show them as all that considerate towards other religions of the region either. Other ancient peoples certainly werent. So the actions of the Arab conquerors arent anything out of the ordinary in the context of their time. Judging something that happened in the 7th century with modern values and then taking some kind of revenge isnt justified. And in this case it again would totally arbitrarily single out Muslims and their religion. Are we also to destroy everything the Romans build on the territories that they had conquered?  And while the religion of Islam certainly was foreign to Jerusalem when the Arabs first conquered it, modern Muslims living there today arent. They are in large parts descendants of the indigenous population that over time had converted to Islam. So why would there be much of a difference between Canaanites converting to Judaism and Jews converting to Islam?  I also again want to stress the importance of those buildings beyond what they might mean to Muslims. Have you ever seen the golden roof of the Dome of the Rock rise above the houses of Jerusalems Old City? Or been inside of it? Those are simply marvelous sites to behold. Not to speak of the historic value of those buildings. The Dome of the Rock is one of the oldest surviving examples of islamic architecture. Its plan and decoration attest how closely related early islamic art was to its christian and roman predecessor. The fabric of al Aqsa Mosque preserves additions from all kinds of art historical periods like for example those from crusader times, when the building was used as a church. All that history should be destroyed because some older history, that cant be brought back anyway, is supposedly more important?  after it's irradiated, right?

"29",28,"5r0u64","2017-01-30","> Two of the forces were Russia's Vladimir Putin and **radical Islamism**, he said, which were trying to undermine the EU project. But he added: ""I have just come back from U.S. and my view is that we have a third front that is undermining the EU... and **that is Donald Trump.""**  This is definitely going to confuse some people here. Man I loved playing red alert as a kid.  I'm loving this real world adaptation!   Kirov reporting.  *""You can always count on Americans to do the right thing - after they've tried everything else.""*   -Winston Churchill Damn fucking right he is. The EU needs to start looking at China.  Verhofstadt is a euro extremist - in a sense that in 2012 he published European Manifesto where he is calling for abandoning nation states parliaments and replace these with the European Parliament, bring more immigrants from Arabic countries, etc. https://www.amazon.com/Europe-Guy-Verhofstadt/dp/1479261882/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1485788228&sr=1-6&keywords=verhofstadt Europe must once and for all get rid of the navel gazing of its nation-states. A radical revolution is needed. A large European revolution. And a European federal Union must emerge. A Union that enables Europe to participate in the postnational world of tomorrow. Of course. Previous US administrations see EU as an ally and want it to be strong. Trump sees it as competitor because of his fragile ego.   I dont think his threats will work. In fact it will lead to more EU unity and support for EU from citizens. Brexit made most of us EU citizens not to take EU for granted anymore, now with Trump it actually makes you feel scared at the thought of not being part of a bigger union. I kind of hoped that he'd get into the Oval Office and be told that there was governance in place to stop him doing all the mad shit he'd fantasised about out loud. Where IS the governance in America? European leaders are a threat to the EU.  Trump didn't cause economic crisis in Spain and Greece.  He didn't cause the devaluation of the euro, or the disturbances and attacks across Europe.  It's like saying that your next door neighbor is creating a fire hazard by lighting a match when you've been setting off fireworks in your living room and your house is already burning. Finally someone speaking some sense. The EU was founded to put an end to the centuries of war in Europe, and now we have to go through that whole process again because people forgot what happened less than a century ago. Definitely read this as ""EU Parliament chief Brexit negotiator guy says."" The European Union is the biggest threat to the European Union. Turn your back on 27 democracies just off our shore and you have to deal with Xi, Erdogan, Trump and the GCC. At least our moral downward slide will be consistent with our economic downward slide. He might give people the (simply racist!) idea that their own countries and their own lives are important instead of ever more globalization for billionaires. That's pretty dangerous. Let's distract people from our shitty open door policy , and trying to bully countries in to getting their quota of ""refugees"" . If anyone is a threaten to EU are those blind motherfuckers in Brussels , not some outsider from U.S. . Yes and damn if I didn't vote for him because of that Hilarious how you globalists are doing everything possible to smear Trump regardless of what he does.  OF course he is a threat to the EU, he and the millions who voted for him reject Soros globalism - and that's a GREAT thing. As a European, it's alarming to see populism on the rise in America, particularly when it seems to be at the behest of a clown President who's been assisted from day 1 by your historic enemies in Putin's camp.  With half of the United Kingdom falling for similar tactics (my heart goes out to the 48% who now completely lack a voice in their country amidst the growing absurdity it finds itself in) I'm now looking to the EU to pull together, and to hear foul, childish manbabies like Donald Trump and his cabinet talk about how he hopes he can destroy our European Union because he's bought and paid for by Putin makes me furious.   As an Irishman I certainly feel closer to my European brothers than I do my supposed old allies in the UK or US these days. When I see amoral populists like Trump, spineless career politicians like May and outright dictators like Putin surrounding us I'm relieved to see relatively steady hands like Merkel at the helm, and a rejection of partisan populism and ""alternate facts"" in the European Union.  And of course Michael D Higgins, greatest of them all. Fucking sensationalists and warmongers. Trump, Putin, Merkel, etc. don't want war. People in this thread appear to want war. Has anyone else noticed that lately? It's almost as if some folks are trying to gin up some anti Russian/European sentiment or something. Fuck that noise. I'm American and I won't be fighting anyone over political disagreements. No fucking shit. I think Trump is also an opportunity for a different EU - one that has a sort of national identity, a European defense, perhaps even a genuine external border. This would be a welcome change from the purely commercial Europe that was built under UK/US influence for the benefits of multinational corporations and the NATO takeover of Eastern Europe.  Under pressure from the West (Trump), the North (Brexit), the East (Russia) and the South (migration flows), cornered Europe might rally to make a stand - after all, it still retains massive economic, demographic, and cultural power.  That seems perhaps far-fetched: such a development would have to face both the ultra-nationalists (who reject the idea of a European culture or nation) and the globalists (who reject the idea of cultures and nations in general). But it might also be a possible compromise for the moderates on each side. >Donald Trump is a threat to the ~~European Union~~ THE WHOLE FUCKING WORLD, ""RUN, EVERYONE"", EU Parliament chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt says  Here fixed America first!  Donald Trump is a threat to America, first. Europe is a threat to the European Union. This is deliberate. He wants to fracture the EU so it cannot stand against Russia.   Well Trump is not even hiding he'd like nothing more than the EU to explode indeed.  Obviously it's easier to twist the arms of small, helpless, isolated countries and force one-sided deals onto them than doing that on a big economic powerhouse. More than ever Europe has to stay united. The E.U. was destroying itself long before President Trump. is trump just a dumbass president elected by chance or he is the new world order? i hate whataboutism and conspiracy theories but how come pous has opponents from all over the world. unbelievable. go fast orange man i am already fed up with this uncertainty. Good. Its about time the EU splits. About time they started feeling the heat. Go trump!  He certainly is on so many levels. While I'm not against that statement, as a Belgian, Guy Verhofstadt is kindof a tool. Welcome to the party.

I'm curious. Got links?  and thank god for that. The butthurt is strong What the fuck has happened in just a week?  In what way? Friend or Foe? No, the only solution for any group of people to achieve security and prosperity is to rally around a common identity and unite to become stronger as a whole. Looking towards others for aid and help is never the way to go in a world of realpolitiks. In fact, China learned this lesson very well through its century of humiliation. It knows that while power does not guarantee security, a lack of power guarantees lack of security. or Japan  After Trump screws up that relation, Japan will need a new Senpai to notice them The EU and Mexico need to ally with China right quick.  All three will be in the crosshairs of the Amero-Russian alliance. Would building a wall help? As an european, fuck this guy and his lunatic views.  What's won't with it?  Lying like a dog. He's for delegating more power to EU parliament, yes, but national parliaments would continue to exist and possess significant power in each and every federalist proposal. Still doens't make him wrong about Russia wanting to break the EU and Trump joining the agenda. But EU **is** USA's competitor. They are both specializing in high tech manufacturing and financial services as main industries. They are not competing in low end manufacturing as this is done by China, nor are completing in resource extraction like Russia or Australia. EU is direct competitor of USA.   > In fact it will lead to more EU unity and support for EU from citizens  Ehhh?  Look at France with Le Pen... Currently the top polling French candidate going into the election, and she is **extremely** anti-EU.  Look at Greece, currently thinking of dropping out of the EU.  If the EU loses the UK, France, *and* Greece, it's basically dead. France, Germany, and the UK made the EU a tripolar group, where smaller nations had 1 of 3 heavyweights to attach to for certain votes. Without France or the UK, the EU is basically whatever Germany wants it to be.   If Greece leaves, it shows to smaller countries there's other options on the table for them other than being forced to do what Germany wants.   Honestly, the election in France determines the future of the EU sadly.  I believe that Europeans now are slowing realizing that EU made them stronger, and others wants to destroy it just for the sake of exploiting merciless each one of the weak individual nations that would result from his split.  Well, better late than never. Trump sees the EU as a source of regulation that prevents him from screwing Europe over as a businessman. It's exactly the type of corporate regulation he is dismantling in the United States.  He said so himself, during his conference with Theresa May. He said he was anti-EU because they wouldn't give him their approval to do something or other.  Remember that Trump wanted to dismantle windfarms in Scotland because they were visible from his golf course. Remember that he hates the environment, and he's not in favor of workers' rights. Remember that he has screwed over many architects, contractors, and others who have worked for him.  This is exactly the type of behavior the EU is targeting. One of the major functions of the EU is to protect the European people from hungry businessmen like Trump.  That's why Trump wants the EU gone. > Trump sees it as competitor because of his fragile ego.  No, the European Union is a competitor, to an extent at least. America is starting to experience brain-drain because a lot of people want to work and live in Europe. This is a trend that started even before Trump, though admittedly he might only exacerbate the problem.   It wasn't all daisy's and hand-holding before Trump came along, believe it or not. The EU is certainly more an ally than a competitor, but that doesn't change the fact that there is competition.   Add in stuff like NATO where only a handful of European nations are actually spending the suggested amount of GDP on their military and it's easy to see why people think America is getting the short-end of the deal. Nobody here wants their taxes going to an alliance that only a handful of members are actually willing to do their part in.  >Trump sees it as competitor because of his fragile ego.   Trump sees the EU as a competitor because he doesn't believe in win-win scenarios.  Everyone should be concerned about that. Both W and Obama greatly expanded executive power during their time in office.  Probably assuming only basically good people would get elected President.  Oops. The Republicans are in charge. They have congress, they have the white house, they'll get the supreme court.  This is the governance in America. This is what Republican leadership looks like. He's been replacing them with swamp creatures and yes-men.   > Where IS the governance in America?  They are all presently GOP controlled, it is no surprise that the GOP is going along with GOP policies. Errr... The US washed their hands of Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq and now Europe has to deal with the fallout. Funny you should use that anology. I was speaking to someone at the European Commission once who compared David Cameron's foreign policy in a not dissimilar fashion.   He said he's like someone whose barbecue has caused a fire on the neighbours house and then comes round to complain that they're making too much noise trying to put it out, and can they be a bit more considerate please Those things will not bring down the union. The most influential nation on Earth being openly against the union is a much bigger threat. Especially since the second most influential nation (Russia) is also not happy with the union either. Maybe they shouldn't try to push the 'I'm so smart' elitist sound of everyone is welcome here, even known terrorists and rapists, and calling everyone doubting it a racist or 'bigot'.  Right? How is it Trump's fault if your pan-national government is floundering? He has no authority over the EU. Hard to see how stacking your cabinet with precisely those billionaires is supposed to give people that idea. Why on earth would someone who abused the system to become a billionaire then change that system when he got into power? See that sounds great and all, but what happens when the little guys can do nothing to support them selves and start relying on communist and fascist regimes? Bashing Soros must be the archetypical Kremlin comment. The current designated Khodorkovsky. > (my heart goes out to the 48% who now completely lack a voice in their country amidst the growing absurdity it finds itself in)  Funnily enough, the person fighting hardest for us is Verhofstadt. > (my heart goes out to the 48% who now completely lack a voice in their country amidst the growing absurdity it finds itself in)  You have no idea how accurate this feels. I feel like Brits and Americans are sharing in a complete feeling of being entirely unable to do or change anything. I'm one of a huge number of young people (18-30 year olds) who have lost every single thing they've ever voted for, and it only gets worse year on year.  > particularly when it seems to be at the behest of a clown President who's been assisted from day 1 by your historic enemies in Putin's camp.  BS. The ""reports"" trying to prove this have been proven to be total BS not worth the paper it's written on. [removed] The majority of the US also didn't vote for Trump and we have no voice.    He's governing like he won 100% of the vote.  Putin do not want war? While the conflict in Ukraine just started again? Right after his call with Trump?  They want peace, all right, after they have seized what they want. Ask Ukraine if Putin wants war or not. Reddit has thrown itself into nothing short of hysteria the past few weeks.  Calling Putin and radical Islamism a threat to the EU is ""going left""? >It went too far left   What?!?! Like most of the history of EU Christian Democrats haven been the biggest party in the European Parliament but also a lot of European governments in this time were 'right wing'. It is not Europe's fault that Americans just have right and far right so totally fucked up perception about what left is... How is the EU going even further left atm? Do you even know what you're talking about... The European Union is accused by many of being too right. You know how hard it was to push through legislation that meant that all EU member countries had to treat gays as human beings?   Sure. We are left for Americans. But it's actually prety right.  Oh boy, and you people call Trump supporters conspiracy theorists. Yep. Happening already, and fast. I do sort of hope that this insanity puts a stop to the fracturing and forces the EU to stick together. I hope that people see what happens when they don't turn up to vote, or when history that is still in the living memory starts to repeat itself.  But then again I'm drunk and when I'm drunk, I'm optimistic. I think the intention is for far right parties to take back control of Europe, these governments would be much more sympathetic towards Trumps goals.   People posting views that aren't similar to yours != brigading.  Do you think anyone expressing a right-leaning thought outside of T_D is brigading? He might impress the eastern Europe, which doesn't need to be, since it's at the boots of the US because of Russia. The Western Europe will probably just laugh at any force one-sided deals.  Yup, he's delusional Just everything he does is theatrics. There's not a single interview or discussion where he's having a normal talk. That's not even what the article implies, it implies that Trump is a threat because of the rise of nationalism in the USA and they are afraid the same could happen in europe. As much as a canister of gas, a lit match, and tank filled with kerosene have a positive correlation. Right. Clinton taking their money, she was totally going to put them in their place he IS the alternative administration... How will he strengthen radical Islam? By drone bombing more people?  Because they can just walk in or sail on a boat. Europe is connected by land to many warzones, unlike say, the US that is basically an island. There is no policy on ""importing"" radical Islamism. This is just a total straw man, and I'm tired of seeing it because it's such bullshit to try to paint us as ""terrorist sympathisers"" when we just don't have anything against the usual immigrant or against the usual Muslim. I swear people knew better just a few years ago.  Because the possibility of a small number of terrorists using this as a means to enter the country should not let us go against the common values of humanism shared and promoted by the overwhelming majority of EU member countries. For many Europeans, it was our grandparents that may even be still alive that were the refugees of a bloody war. Part of founding the EU was to say ""never again"" to such a war and its atrocities, but rather link our future, first economical and now political, to achieve co-operation. Because EU, unlike USA, doesn't have two oceans to protect it. There are safe zones - camps in Greece and Turkey were those safe zones. In the end, refugees overflowed them and went west. There wasn't a humane way to stop them  Extreme vetting? That also exists... for people that choose to obtain refugee status in a legal way. Again, hordes marching to the west, aren't legal way. > building safe zones isn't ""viable""  Wasn't Hillary *highly* criticized for suggesting something like this? Because those guys do not care if you want them or not. Consider the camp at Calais called the Jungle, which gets cleared every few months only to pop up again. These are people that go into boats and make them sink 1 km away from the shore to make rescue services get you. Consider the human waves trying to climb the 3-5 fences at Melila. Illegal immigrants do not care if it is illegal or not. In the end, it was just legalized > Russia, Islam and America!  truely the I.R.A. are the worst terrorists. He is obviously being mind controlled by Yuri, who is wearing Pence as a costume.    I mean ""trump tower"" is halfway there I'm not worried about Europe. Not at all. We're very strong. As a Union, there's things that could go wrong but even then I don't see it coming from the outside. And Russia knows what borders they can't cross. Russia can fuck with the Baltic States all they want, but one step further and suddenly you have World War III. They don't want that, we don't want that, so it's not gonna happen. Then you're a genuine idiot.  If the russians wanted Ukraine they'd take it and there's nothing Ukraine can do about it. It's that simple.  They don't want it cos it's a bloody liability and complete waste of money. 90% of their infrastructure is garbage.   The only real thing the russians want is for the US to fuck off and leave them alone.  > ""According to the Kremlin, the two presidents agreed to a ""partner-like co-operation"" on issues including Ukraine  You probably mean that Trump agreed to allow Russia to do anything they wanted - and Putin agreed not to release video of President Trump in bed with hookers... > I'm legitimately worried about the future of us all.  Don't worry. In the possible worst case, an invasion of the Baltics will be met as was the invasion of Poland or Serbia. It might be hard, we will unite against anyone who threatens us. Let's hope we never again fall in such times, but if we do, we will not stand idle. Pfff. Dude if Russia wanted Ukraine they wouldve taken Ukraine years ago. You think the Uki army can withstand Russia? They would roll into Kiev in about 2 or 3 days.   Could it be that Putin calling Trump and then immediately resuming operations regardless of whatever they actually did talk about could be completely intended by Russia to make the rest of the world think that Putin and Trump struck some kind of deal about the Ukraine when this in fact wasn't actually the case?    Trump doesn't seem like the sharpest tack in the drawer when it comes to handling phone calls and thinking about consequences.  His team doesn't seem to be that smart either. But maybe they do have a plan; what do I know? Fighting has been ongoing this month. The flare up has been in part caused by Ukrainian advances into neutral territory.   > since mid-December Ukraine's armed forces have edged farther into parts of the gray zone in or near the war-worn cities of Avdiivka, Debaltseve, Dokuchaievsk, Horlivka, and Mariupol, shrinking the space between them and the separatist fighters.  > In doing so, the pro-Kyiv troops have sparked bloody clashes with their enemy, which has reportedly made advances of its own -- or tried to -- in recent weeks.  Source: http://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-creeping-offensive-escalation-fighting/28268104.html   They did? Fuck. That hasn't been reported on at all in the US. > More than 10 people have been killed in some of the worst fighting for weeks in eastern Ukraine.  >Russia restarted its offensive in Ukraine after Trump and Putin had their call.  Ok, buddy. This one's a good start: [not a picture of linked sausages or that picture of Bradley Manning with the mask on his head](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/11/20/1452457/-Time-to-pull-out-again-The-14-Points-of-Fascism) Not true at all.  See: Hui Muslims  The Chinese government is against Uighurs because of the terrorism there. To the Hui muslims, they grant a huge amount of privileges.    Common sense kicked in.  Trumps pretty popular in Japan  Nope. Considering that the main focus of Trump's politics (and imo future US politics in general, regardless of which party is in power) is China's containment, Japan is very much in his corner.  Japan is basically a US Protectorate As a European I agree with pretty much all of his views, however I do think Europe needs to reform its immigration policy  As a european, I am 100% in agreement with Verhofstadt.   His complete vision might be a bit extreme, but the federation is the only ideal I would fight in a war for.  I truly am curious why you consider those views to be that of a lunatic And he's the bloke leading Brexit for you guys This is just a transition to them. Sovereignty would be stolen over time by Bruxelles.  Economy is not a zero-sum game. USA benefits from having access to the biggest market in the world. The EU provides high standard of living and consumers for many things the USA creates.  Go sell Iphones in China, see how Apple fares afterward. They may not compete on the same market, but that doesn't mean they are complementary. Economically, perhaps - although a rich and prosperous Europe benefits the US because it increases trade over the Atlantic.  The problem is that Trump sees the EU as a threat and wants to destroy it. Not only this has negative repercussions on Europe economically, but in terms of security. This in turn benefits a certain friend of his in Moscow. Not really. EU and US trade is a good thing. Tech is utterly dominated by the US, so whatever the EU does is small potatoes in comparison. I thought the business party was all in favor of competition?  I thought competition was the cornerstone of the ""free market""?  I thought competition was the driving force behind what makes capitalism so magnificent? Most of the EU are NATO members, so we are allied with the EU. Trade wise, both benefit from increasing free trade than by reducing trade relations. Greece is in no state to leave the EU. The EU is the only thing that's stopped it from collapsing entirely. If, hypothetically speaking, France leaves EU, they will suffer harder financial consequences than UK.   > Look at France with Le Pen... Currently the top polling French candidate going into the election, and she is extremely  anti-EU. >   Top polling in the first round. She stands almost no chance in the second round because everyone who would vote for her would have already voted for her in the first round.  As a Spanish I'm fine with doing what ever Germany says. >Look at Greece, currently thinking of dropping out of the EU  Source?  >Look at France with Le Pen... Currently the top polling French candidate going into the election, and she is extremely anti-EU.  With a whole 25% support. It's opponents are: Fillon (22%), Macron (21%), Hamon (15%), and some other minor left wing candidates.  French people do not want to leave the EU, there was a poll after the brexit shitshow and it was discussed, almost everyone was against it, we know it would be a very bad idea.  And Marine LePen won't win, she might do good in first round but she'll get crushed in the second, you'll see. > If the EU loses the UK, France, and Greece, it's basically dead.  I disagree.  The EU will suck without France, and a Le Pen win would be a major blow to the European economy, that much is true.  But the EU will survive even without France and the Netherlands. The small countries - Czech Republic, Slovenia, Hungary, etc - recognize the benefit of staying in the Union, and the majority of members will stay together, with Schengen, with the single market, with the Euro. They will hold Europe together until the populist wave passes and the French and British ask to be let back in.  Germany is not a tyrant. They are an economic powerhouse with a mature - if cold and weird - population. They are not going to antagonize the other member states when so much is at stake. Le Pen is favorite for the first round.  But she will be crushed in the 2nd.  > Without France or the UK, the EU is basically whatever Germany wants it to be    How is that? I agree that Germany would have the most influence. But saying that they'll be able to do whatever they want is not true. > Currently the top polling French candidate going into the election, and she is extremely  anti-EU.  And she's probably going to be *thrashed* in the run-off by a pro-EU Macron. Currently.  I bet seeing the effects of Trump might make some Le Pen voters reconsider. I think that Putin might hold out for seeing how Le Pen and other potential far-right candidates are going to do in the upcoming elections, as it rather suits his goal to cripple the EU. The moment Russia continues to move forwad with his campaign to invade Ukraine is the moment when the spectre of a world war walks again within Europe and that is when any indication of political collaboration or shared history with Putin will become a toxic liability - unless Putin succeeds in placing his vasals in positions of power. Yes but let's see how well she polls now that Trump is in power. French voters might loose their appetite for cunt. And May is proving the UK maybe needed to fuck out of Europe. We might be better off without their strong anti European sentiment.   And I say this as someone who lived there for years, I love the UK and most of my friends are Brits (who support the EU), but the reality is that British political leaders have done all they could do undermine the union for decades now.  His anti-globalist attitude will have helped strengthened globalism anyways.  Crazy how nature do that. He even said that before, when he referred to the EU as ""the consortium"" that didn't allow him to do whatever the fuck he wanted. > America is starting to experience brain-drain because a lot of people want to work and live in Europe.  Except that isn't true to my knowledge. America isn't experiencing a ""brain drain"" in the slightest. True, experienced and capable people do sometimes want to work in Europe. However the reverse is also true.   Not to mention that the United States is one of the largest beneficiaries of ""brain drain"" from other countries.   Suggesting that US citizens living outside the United States as a significant economic problem sounds like an excuse to justify policies rather than anything factual.  Do you have a source for the brain drain part of your comment? Cause you could be right about Americans wanting to work in Europe, but people go the other way as well. Good points.  I agree.   Maybe if getting a higher education wouldn't cost a limb in the USA you would keep more of your best and brightest. There more than enough brainy people in the USA, but many of them don't get to develop their talents because of their economic background. This is imho a tragedy, so much talent wasted on greed. I hope you're right. I also hope that the ""inevitable"" you mean is impeachment, because there are other candidates for that title: thermonuclear war and constitutional crisis leading to martial law. Italy and Greece have been begging for help for decades. The problem reaches a head now, not because of the US though we did add accelerant to the flame, but because you failed to deal with it then.   Berlusconi had a 3b deal with Ghadaffi.  To say Europe is innocent here is not based on reality. France lead Libya. French forces were on the ground in Syria all the way back in 2011.  Yeah and we are critisizing the guy who wants to solve these problems? No foreign intervention policy, no removing governments policy, no unofficial drone-strikes policy. No just lets make fun of his last name and his wife and son.  A decades long conflict in the middle east and europe only starts having problems after they open the doors. Wuick blame america! Funny how that works Maybe if Merkel didn't tell everyone that unlimited number of people can enter and all will receive benefits. Maybe that would have helped.  And maybe the EU should not have forced migrants on every other country, Germany wanted them, Germany can have them all. The US had nothing to do with Syria.  I would also argue that its up to Europe to protect its borders from the influx of migrants. Look at the gulf states and take notes, they are right next door by they put up walls and barriers and restricted immigration. What fallout?  China is more influential than Russia and China is pro eu > second most influential nation (Russia)  Russia is the 12th largest economy in the world, what are you on about? He is certainly hostile to it and talking to act in that regard Because a lot of them are very capable people. Not every billionaire thinks like Soros neither. Implying a country can't thrive without globalist views. >I'm one of a huge number of young people (18-30 year olds) who have lost every single thing they've ever voted for, and it only gets worse year on year.  So, a referendum and two or so national elections. The fact that you get to vote means you don't lack a voice.  Just because your side has been losing since you came of voting age doesn't mean you're dis-enfranchised; it just means it's shitty timing.  Things will swing back in the other direction and then the other side will get to feel what you're currently feeling.  It's the compromise that we all agree to when we live in democracies.   [removed] He's governing like he won. What are you talking about?  So Putin told Ukranian forces to shell Separatists territories?   You're going with that, really? Right? It feels weird. Like it's forced on us or our front pages. I get it, people don't like Trump. I don't get the people on reddit that don't like Trump and speak nothing but war with other nations. As an American, I hear so often on reddit that Europeans are so far to the left that it makes American liberals look like Conservatives. I hear so often that America doesn't even have a left because we are so far to the right compared to Europe.  So I don't see how it can be both? It seems obvious that Europe is the most ""left"" you can get in the world. So it seems accurate to say it went ""too far to the left"" unless you think its a good thing... If you belong to the alt-right, then everyone looks like far left. No they obviously don't but this is a right wing populist on reddit so in their alternative reality its all correct  And besides that, the US is our most important military ally, if they go full isolationist or anti EU we are scrEUwed Makes no sense to me. Nationalism has been in Europe far longer than the us.  Anyone brushing up on Lenin right now? Seriously, what should we do, spend years and billions building walls around all of our countries? There surely are better things to spend taxpayer money on that benefits most people, not just some building companies and kleptocrats. Might as well just ban all immigration by the same logic, some percent of them will commit crimes and murders. Yup, my granny (now my only living grandparent) was herself a refugee. It was mostly for the no-fly zone. There are already many safe zones in Syria and around the ME. are the refugees gonna sail boats to the US too? >Russia can fuck with the Baltic States all they want, but one step further and suddenly you have World War III.   Wtf?! No, he can't!   Those are NATO and EU members you're talking about! If Russia steps into those, he's getting fucking article-5-ed!  > Russia can fuck with the Baltic States all they want, but one step further and suddenly you have World War III.  The Baltic states are part of NATO. He fucks with them, it's WW3.  Unless of course Trump gets around to destroy NATO, or worse yet provide aid to Russia. In that case, we're fucked. The EU needs to raise a united European Army to counter the Russian threat. If Trump/Putin get their way, US troops will pull out of Europe and the whole continent will be exposed.   This is our age of appeasement. Do we stop Russian aggression now or let it escalate to the point where we're all dead?? 'As a union' is a vital part of your story.   Trump and Putin are looking to break us up. At that point we'll a bunch of vassals and nobodys, waiting to be eaten by Putin or economically taken over by Chinese state firms  good thing you're not involved in anything of responsibility... > I don't see it coming from the outside.  Guess what, the Russians are actively trying to Undermine the French elections now  Lots of propaganda in Germany already  Britain is leaving the EU  You're not as safe as you may think you are > there's things that could go wrong but even then I don't see it coming from the outside  You realize Russia is largely responsible for the funding, dissemination, and support of the far right in the west right?  So even if your farright political parties appear to be from the inside, it is outside influence creating, nurturing, supporting and sustaining them. I bet in 1939 you would be on the side of those people who were saying to fuck Poland and leave all the Baltic States for Hitler to do however he plisses. Ass long as your ass is safe right? Those same types of agreements are what led to ww1 > They don't want that, we don't want that, so it's not gonna happen.    This is the line of thinking that got Trump elected in the first place... But are you as strong as the hard thick magnum d0ng of the United states? Actually EU is weak. And you should blame this on EU establishment. > Russia can fuck with the Baltic States all they want  Members of nato and eu. Nope.  But Ukraine? Hmmm.... You are a fool. > And Russia knows what borders they can't cross. Russia can fuck with the Baltic States all they want,  No, they cannot. Even out of self-interest alone countries like Germany and Poland would be against it. With all that entails for Nato and the EU. No shit, they act like sanctions stopped the Russian juggernaut where it stood, Putin could have taken the whole of Ukraine if he wanted too, Obama wasn't going to stop him.  I honestly can't believe that trump would be worried about a prostitute video.  He'd have to be doing something that would get him arrested, so like diddling kids, or rape, or something illegal.  Possibly skat/piss stuff, but just fucking hookers?  I doubt he'd care.  He'd just call it fake.  It's far more likely he has personal business ventures that he's trying to build/grow/establish. How does this line up with trump? Where is the connection. It doesn't exactly mention it. The only reason the Hui aren't six feet under is because they do pretty much everything the government tells them to. The Chinese people are also fine with them being alone for the most part. A couple protests here and there may be tolerated since they are so obedient. But any sign of rebellion and they will be completely annihilated. If a Hui tries to go against the Han on any serious issue they will be put into their place.  Source-Born and grew up in China Depends if he follows through on the whole withdrawing military support thing or not.  Why? You don't think the EU should be federal? As a US citizen, it makes no sense to me to abolish local parliaments.  Edit: it looks like I misinterpretted something. The abandonment of nation-state parliaments apparently doesn't mean their dissolution it seems.  Edit 2: OP posting alternative facts. And you probably have worldview and knowledge of a 15 year old. Go read some history of USSR and the reasons for its fall. Also tell me how power accumulation instead of distribution is good? Stolen or transferred to? And what's wrong with unified sovereignty? The amount of power the EU would have as a singular state would rival, or even supplant, that of the US. Sure, Verhofstadt is a boogeyman under your bed. Wondering what nation will leave the EU next doesn't mean he'll put in policy to destroy the EU. If anything his talks about NATO will only strength it as the EU looks more into creating its own standing army. Can I get a link where any of this is vindicated? Globalization is ending as there are no more markets to expand into as well as profit margins are shrinking. The world is starting to break into macro-regions. USA will try to do what it does best is eliminating competition.  Depends which tech, Germany makes twice as many cars than US that are of better quality and cheap thanks to artificially low euro for German exports. I thought Trump was advocating for a greater degree of protectionism as opposed to Dems globalisation direction as seen in Hillary's TTIP and Trump's pulling out of it. the phoenix can only rise from the ashes when the rot is burned away.   Many would argue that the only reason Greece has been in poor shape going on a decade is *because* it is in the EU.  How do you figure that one?  Before joining the EU, Greece had biggest ship building sector, huge machinery building, construction materials, etc. After? just massive debt, some tourist industry and olives.   Same for former soviet-block countries that joined. They were completely hollowed out. Poland too. All manufacturing is gone as all EU laws are drafted to protect key member's industries, and use new members as dumping groups for subsidized products. While new members start adjusting to EU rules, their products are simply not needed in the core, and removal of tariffs makes imports from EU core into EU periphery cheaper than locally manufactured products. Result? local industry disappears, many people become unemployed, which results in increased crime, poverty, specialists leave to work in EU-core, more nimble but less skilled end up switching to trade (that is import products and sell locally) rather than manufacturing anything. In a generation, you end up with a loss of know-how in different technological areas and the country is now lacking skills to start high-tech production.  Unfortunately, the only enemy of EU is EU itself. It's been true by design.  ""Trump loses badly in late November polling"" Everyone also thought that Trump was a joke and would never become president. And the UK thought that Brexit was a joke that would never happen. That was the situation, yes.  She currently loses only 40/60. Her primary contender, the second most popular candidate, has an investigation open against him and has announced he will drop out of the race entirely if charges are filed.  There's an assumption you find on reddit and elsewhere that Le Pen is so terrible, the 60% of people who don't support her would literally vote for anyone at all except her. That seems like the sort of lazy assumption that was widespread in the runup to Brexit or Trump. Le Pen is an economic socialist (France tends to like that) with anti-Islamic views (France tends to like that either, it's the home of the burqa ban) and anti-EU views (France is the most Euroskeptic nation in the EU after Greece and the EU has lower approval ratings there than in the UK). And even if Le Pen won, I'm pretty sure a ""Frexit"" referendum has no shot at passing It won't happen. The French aren't eurosceptics. No one who matters is pushing for it. Our British friends were tremendously less favorable to the European Union and it still took a campaign of lies to get them to leave. The same referendum would most likely have a different outcome today. Whoa now, Franco.  Seriously though I'm surprised Spain isn't a ""larger"" part of the EU. because German leadership is working out so great for Southern Europe Grexit has been a serious thing for years now, with it getting worse with Russia offering to assist Greece should they.  http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/grexit-greeks-look-follow-britain-out-europe-despite-post-brexit-recession-fears-1569497  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/06/23/these-countries-could-be-next-if-britain-leaves-the-e-u/?utm_term=.713bfcd1e1b7  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3658046/Now-chance-leave-Voters-Sweden-Denmark-Greece-demand-say-broken-Europe-Austria-Germany-devastated.html  http://www.politico.eu/article/whispers-of-grexit-start-again-greece-economy-bailout-imf-eu/  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/21/what-is-a-grexit-and-how-would-greece-leaving-affect-the-euro-in/  https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/06/grexit-back-on-the-agenda-economy-unravels-reforms  25% is still the top polling candidate... After the first round it'll be Le Pen, Fillon, and Macron. From there... what happens if Fillon and Macron split their more liberal voting base, causing both of them to lose?   Fact is, EU unity is at its all time lowest, with the very real possibility of it completely falling apartafter the May election in France. I'm a strongly Pro-EU American, but the facts are facts... The EU is in an extremely dangerous place going forward, and the French Presidential election can very well be the straw that breaks the camel's back. So the biggest party you say...  More support then any of the others can manage... and that is your idea of re-assuring. Hey, Hitler only got 37%. Relax world! Please don't say those things. It sounds just like Brexit won't win and Trump won't win. It doesn't instill confidence.  I hope you're right, in any case. The whole point of the EU is to bring together Germany and France so they'll stop throwing the continent into devastating wars. An EU without France will not be very interesting to Germany who will have to stop spending money holding the EU together so it can afford to start building up its armed forces again. at what point is it just Germany and new German territory? RemindMe! 3 Months She might have a narrow path against Fillon if the messaging resonates, his welfare reform proposals (sweeping cuts) and the assault on half a million jobs introduces an element of jeopardy. She isn't threatening to rip this up by contrast. What she's doing instead is advocating withdrawing it for immigrants. That could float better than is widely imagined yet. She needs to be nudging the mid to high 30's though and she's never really been close to that territory. I agree she loses against Macron, and with quite a bit to spare.  I expect Europe to emerge unscathed from the 2017 electoral season, albeit with nationalist candidates making advances. The European Council does need to get on top of this though. If you look at the survey evidence you can see a clear trend. The people are adopting unfavorable opinions of policy implementation, but haven't as yet begun to translate this into unfavourable views of the EU as a concept. This isn't a sustainable position however. The European Council and the Commission need to get this train back on the tracks, or the unfavorability cancer will begin to spread    If I were looking for a Euro car crash down the road, then the one that's under the radar at the moment (and has a history for electoral volatility) is Italy. This is a country that's shown an alarming tendancy to make panic stricken decisions, and is of course home to the original Trump candidate. There's a clear fault line in the Italian economy and its chronic under performance since 2002, and that leads all the way to the common currency You would be surprised at the depth and coverage of the election and aftermath here in Europe. With luck they will ditch that bitch.  They might not want someone who does exactly what he says he will do?  And here I am, a European trying to get a job in the United States. > US spending more than their target is choice by US government  Yes, this is something few people seem to understand. The US spends all that money to secure its influence in Europe and around the world. It's not some imposition from the EU or NATO or favor to them. It's the US looking out for itself. Greece dug the hole they're stuck in themselves, nobody else did. Rampant abuse of retirement funds to dead people and a retirement age of <55 crippled their economy from the inside and corruption took care of most of the bailout packages Germany has offered. Russia is not a big economy, but has influence in a lot of countries and is involved in many wars/unrests. GDP is absolutely not a measurement of power. Is India influencing elections world wide and waging proxy wars? No. Russia is a military/industrial, technologic, economic, cultural, and nuclear armed great power with much to gain with an unstable EU.  E: Also the largest natural resource rich country in the world, think lumber, oil, and vast minerals. In 7 years that I've been allowed to vote, two elections (2010, 2015) and two referendums (alternative voting, EU). Also council elections are completely lost to me as I currently live in a safe seat area, and the party that holds that safe seat is not a party I generally support. Think I've voted for them twice too. [removed] Kennedy won with 100,000 votes and that was considered a close margin. So he governed from the center and even brought republicans into his administration.   Trump won with an 80,000 vote margin in three states while losing the popular vote by 3,000,000... and since getting in office he's only appealed to the hard right.   In fact he's behaving like he has a clear mandate and treating the people who voted against either irrelevant or illegal aliens.   The man lacks any wisdom whatsoever. And it shows... Especially the way his foreign policy is off to a disastrous start.   > He's governing like he won.   He's governing like a fucking moron which is exactly what the majority who voted against him were afraid of.  >It seems obvious that Europe is the most ""left""   Communism. >unless you think its a good thing...  Of course I think its a good think. Heath care, maternity leave, labor laws, agricultural standards, no capital punishment, redistribution..what is not good here?  Then you tell me why do you think the 'bigoted right wing' US is better then 'far left' Europe? What do you guys do better? If the US goes full isolationist then the EU will have to decide if it's going to become a proper federation or get seriously pushed around by Russia.  But, here's the thing, the current EU nations have a combined economy roughly equivalent in size to that of the US and a population far larger than that of the US and Russia *combined* (some 510 million). A truly united Europe would be a genuine, nuclear armed superpower. There's no reason Europe needs to be screwed, but they might still choose to screw themselves by continuing down the road of nationalistic rejection of union. Yup. They'll use it as an excuse to make an EU-army, which actually *will* get funding, instead the ones of some other armies. (Hi there, helmet-less, tank-less and ammo-less Dutch army!) Oh, and the funding will come from a new EU tax system. Mark my words. The US is not going full isolationist. Its just rearranging its foreign policy. It will normalise relations with Russia and confront China instead. This is what the EU fears. They will stand alone against Russia.   Ofcourse, they could (and will have to) also normalise relations with Russia and hammer out some sort of security structure with them for (Eastern) Europe, but will do so out of a position of weakness without the US backing them up. I'd just like to comfort you with the knowledge that Trump has four years to dismantle the republic or he's not coming back for another round.  We're all petrified, but this most likely won't last. There'll be incalculable damage in the interim, but even if we go full isolationist, the next president is going to be a Democrat, farther left of center than we've seen in *ages*. It'd be nice if Europeans remembered this when they're bitching about how much the US spends on our military.   If we peace out, have fun footing the bill for your own shit.  We are not going to go "" full isolationist "". Americans don't  really want that even most Trump supporters  don't.  > Nationalism has been in Europe far longer than the us.  considering the majority of Americans came from Europe to make colonies based on nationalistic reasons, its more of a continuation of the existing system than a clean break. It does make sense. It could make it rise further. I was just pointing out a geographical fact that some people seem to forget when discussing preventing refugees from entering europe. Physically preventing people from entering would be expensive as you say, and not necessarily effective.   Ideally the solution would be to not sponsor more unstability in the middle east and other warzones and maybe speeding deportations for non refugees abusing refugee channels, although that depends on their home countries collaborating and facilitating the pertinent documentation. Oh, woops If trump provides aid to russia, I promise you he will be murdered The worst Trump can do is pull out of NATO, I doubt the remaining countries will dissolve it just because the US leaves. how is trump destroying NATO? I'm pretty sure that's beyond the reach of an EO. But seriously, how is he destroying it? Why would he provide aid to russia after destroying NATO? it's a fallacy. you're writing alarmist fiction and you were actually upvoted for it. It's the exact social mechanism that sells tabloid trash to idiots.  Why does NATO need the US to respond to Russia?  Aren't there enough members besides the US? WWIII will be push button and we are all fucked.  Probably not providing aid, but selling arms or non military equipment to both sides. With his business background, I wouldn't be surprised if this happens. The fact that EU so highly requires the use of US soldiers while being one of the strongest economies in the world shows how backward it is. EU needs its own military despite what the US does.  [removed] The US is (maybe) forging an alliance with Russia for a far larger threat, the rise of Asia lead by China. There is no way the US would give or even entertain the possibility of surrendering such a strategic cornerstone to no-one, or Russia of all countries. Their alliance if it happens will probably include Europe.  There is no strategic interest for the US to let Europe at the hands of anyone and this is known to everyone. Still, we are at propaganda levels, the pieces have not moved yet.  Russia is not some unstoppable juggernaut. There are plenty of European powers that can stop them in their tracks if they go too far in their conquest, even individually. Historically, before the EU, European nations weren't exactly a bunch of vessels and nobody's. I understand your worry, just trying to reassure that there's still plenty of power either way. Europe, it's your responsibility to stay united right now. The EU is under attack from many sides - Russia, the US, and populism within the EU itself. You are the good guys in this world.  However, this is just another challenge. I have no doubt that the European Union will survive this decade and the next, even without major members like France and the Netherlands. The smaller countries of Europe, like Austria and the Czech Republic and probably Spain, are likely to remain together as a single union. The rest of the world is integrating into EU like entities - Africa and South America both, for example, have nearly pan-continental unions which will soon start issuing their own passports and currency - and states like the UK will be at a marked disadvantage, forced to suck up to people like Erdogan and Trump.  What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. It's taken six thousand years and six hundred wars for Europe to reach the level of progress it has reached today. This period of time is just another challenge in Europe's history. I know that the majority of you can stay together, even if Le Pen and Wilders take power. Why would a US president act in a way to break up and allow Europe to be consumed/conquered by its two largest international competitors? What does Trump or the US get out of Europe falling under Russia and China? Britain leaving the EU has literally nothing to do with Russia. I'm sure they're happy that it happened, but they played no part in it. Still more than safe enough. Like Marine Le Pen, ""No one else will help fund my campaign of course I will take Russian money."". There's a reason she can't secure funding. Merkel is being actively targeted like Hillary, and yes GB was pushed out with the help of Russian $. Seriously if France is the next to go, kiss world stability good bye. It will take decades to recover just from the cultural shift. In 1939 it was France and Britain goverments who gave Hitler the freedom of action.  You mean the fluffy orange cheeto weenie? Sure. > Possibly skat/piss stuff  Well, he *did* have the hookers piss all over the bed reportedly. > It's far more likely he has personal business ventures that he's trying to build/grow/establish.  I still think the most likely explanation is he just likes Putin and his style of leading. Okay, lemme just quote the part that's about Trump.  ---   **Powerful and Continuing Nationalism**  Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.  **Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights**  Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of ""need."" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.  **Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause**  The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial, ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.  **Supremacy of the Military**  Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.  **Rampant Sexism**  The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy.  **Controlled Mass Media**  Sometimes the media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.  **Obsession with National Security**  Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.  **Religion and Government are Intertwined**  Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.  **Corporate Power is Protected**  The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.  **Labor Power is Suppressed**  Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.  **Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts**  Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.  **Obsession with Crime and Punishment**  Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.  **Rampant Cronyism and Corruption**  Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.  **Fraudulent Elections**  Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections. Any sign of rebellion against the ruling party and they get put six feet under, is what every group in China lives under.  That's a pretty bad measurement stick.    Source: born and grew up in China.  ...   So in translation, you're saying China is anti-islam except for in every situation where they aren't. Kazakhs did not integrate and they're not being discriminated against for their religion. Neither are any of the other 7 Muslim ethnic groups in China. The only group being discriminated against is the Uighurs.   While I don't support Uighur discrimination, I'll remind you that part of the reason the situation is as it is is because there's an ongoing terrorist movement within the border, trying to turn it into East Turkmenistan. It has far less to do with religion and far more to do with crushing the rebellion within the region.   Additionally, Hui Muslims do have a unique and distinct culture.  I'm not denying racism is a problem within the country; I'm from there and have had a first hand experience seeing the racism. However, it's fucking stupid to choose a situation which is actually not true. It devalues your whole argument and makes people doubt you.   It's the same thing with the refugee crisis in Europe. We know it's a problem and it has to be solved. Claiming that they're going to build a caliphate in a few years just makes you look uneducated (not saying that that's what you're claiming, but it's just another example of a situation where overplaying your hand makes your entire statement look false.)   > Why? You don't think the EU should be federal? As a US citizen, it makes no sense to me to abolish local parliaments.  I am european and I also agree with the V guy. The problem is that our parliaments proved to be incapable of handling the country.  Besides, where would be the difference with the US? I elect my country representatives to the european parliament and government, they make the laws. Done.  >And a European federal Union must emerge  guy said he was in agreement with this.   Are state legislatures abolished because the US is a federal republic?  Som European countries are federal states in themselves, [Germany for example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Administrative_divisions_of_Germany.svg).  Europe is currently some kind of federal'ish structure, usually referred to as a [""supranational union""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supranational_union), in which each nation is a sovereign state that has conferred sovereignty of some specific areas to the federal level, but retain ultimate sovereignty.   Some European federalists want a ""truly federal"" EU, but the majority want EU member states to confer soverignty on larger number of areas, for example allowing the EU to act a single unit from a defence perspective. Or a fiscal transfer perspective (e.g. alleviating the economic crisis), or with regard to securing the borders of member states (this has happened recently - under some criticism from a number of member states). Comparing the soviet union to the EU; and you accuse *me* of having the worldview/knowledge of a 15 year old?  Good to know irony is still a thing. ""unified sovereignty"" an elite group of people managing their own interest, who are not chosen by the people, taking more and more regulations from nuanced countries and normalizing them over all the countries and create fake 'for the greater good' laws.  I just watched his AJ interview and he fits the profile of the EU bogeyman perfectly.  He also want to have a deal done quick with the UK before the UK is allowed to negotiate it (UK can't negotiate FTA while part of EU) to prove other countries that there is a life beyond EU.   Reworded, he want to help UK break EU law to show other countries that they too can be better off outside the EU.   If that's not aggressively against the Union, I don't know what is https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2017/01/europe-trump/513248/  >he described NATO as obsolete, called the EU basically a vehicle for Germany, and said other countries would follow the U.K.s lead and leave the bloc. That's like saying the dollar is ""artificially low"" for North Dakota exports because Mississippi is a shithole.   And they would be wrong. Greece's economic collapse was due to decades of internal corruption. The polls tell a different story. Remain and Hilary were usually ahead, but never by much.  Trump is an extra special outlier since the polls that said more Americans would vote for Hilary were spot on, they just didn't account for how those votes would be distributed. >Everyone also thought that Trump was a joke and would never become president. And the UK thought that Brexit was a joke that would never happen.  Both were in the margin of error. Le Pen loses by over 20 points to everybody. But her opponents aren't as terrible as hillary was to trump imo, and also, EVEN if lepen got elected (she won't) she would still be 100 times better than dumb trump. This is a very recent poll  >Le Pen: 25%, Fillon: 22%, Macron: 21%, Hamon: 15%, Melenchon: 10%.   Fillon is done so it's looking likely that it will be Macron - Le Pen in the second round. Thing is though Macron does better against her than Fillon, 65% - 35%. >She currently loses only 40/60.  Which, for comparison's sake, is the biggest projected loss since 2002, when the Front national lost 80-20. Before that, you have to go back to 1969.   >There's an assumption you find on reddit and elsewhere that Le Pen is so terrible, the 60% of people who don't support her would literally vote for anyone at all except her.  No. The 40/60 is based on polling results putting her against a variety of other candidates. It's not speculation, it's as real as we know. It's as real as all the other numbers we have.   JLM's vote might go to Lepen but Fillon/Macron will vote for the other I bet and the standard left won't vote for Lepen, I truly think we are safe on this one. Le Pen won't use referendums. She loves democracy as much as Trump or Putin nah Spanish people love the good life , don't get me wrong they are very efficient but Germans are in another whole level SO I WOULDN'T MIND Spain getting closer to that level you know?  To be fair, we are kind of poor and we are mostly centered on internal issues, especially now that we have an extremely weak government with only 137/350 MPs Only the top 2 candidates proceed to the second round. In those same polls they also asked the various scenarios such as Le Pen vs. Macron, Le Pen vs. Fillon etc. Not one matchup was she polled as the victor.   In 2002 when Le Pen the elder went up against Chirac he lost by the biggest margin in any French presidential election ever. Even bigger than Louis-Napoleons victory in 1848.   Basically if Le Pen goes to the second round, people will cross party lines to vote for her opponent. Just like they did in 2002 against her father.  But only two candidates go for the second round. So it'll be Fillon-LePenn or Macron-LePenn which will probably lead to a repeat of the 2002 election and most of the electorate backing Fillon/Macron >25% is still the top polling candidate  Following the same poll Le Pen is losing 2nd round by the margin of 20% with any other candidate. ECB, EMF, European Council and Eurogroup will not push for Grexit, and neither will any of the large parties in Greece. The window for leaving has been long gone, and relevant actors are aware that the debt will need to be cut, eventually. both, Eurozone and Greek economies are recovering, inflation is approaching normal levels, and any such shock would be an unnecessary event.  Grexit was talked about in the context of Greece leaving the Eurozone monetary union, not the European Union. 2nd round in French presidential elections is always a two candidate run off. See Greece's protest against TPP and Obama while he was visiting last year? HOLY SHIT! They wanted him(obama) out of their country and wanted TPP in the shitter. They know how to protest!! They put Nazi march to shame... very well organized. Worth the look up if you get time. Makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up.  ""Biggest party"" doesn't say much, as it can either be two parties, splitting 50/50, or it can be 10 parties, splitting into tens. I do agree that her rise is worrisome, though. Brexit polls showed it was ahead at times, but neck and neck for the most part. The popular vote in the US election was within statistical error for nation wide polls so neither were *that* much of a surprise. Polls for the French election show Le Pen getting obliterated, she loses 60 - 40 against Fillon (who's most likely dead in the water), she loses 65 - 35 against Macron. Let me remind you that Trump lost the popular Vote but still won because of your fucked up system. Lepen will lose popular vote, so she will lose. I hope I'm not wrong, but I am pretty confident, there's no way we would let that happen. That may be one very important function of the EU, but it isn't the whole point of it. The EU also provides opportunity to its citizens - free movement of people, education, single market, single currency, the benefit of being part of an economic power and not another tiny vulnerable state surrounded by other tiny vulnerable states. When the entire EU speaks German as a native language, which will never happen.  Germany has a strong economy and very low unemployment, and good social support systems, plus health care and don't they have free education? And free movement of people means that anybody from any member state can show up in Germany, get the education, and get a job. This kind of basic accessibility is good for citizens of the other member states, who would then be able to go back to their home countries and create their own industries if they wanted to, with no border restrictions. I think the only way you'll miss France's election results is if you quit social media and live in a cave. If there is a growing resentment in the EU, amongst the populace, for the actions of the EU, what is the proper response? Do they herd the residents back toward what they perceive to be the right path, like autocratic philosopher kings? Do they act more along the lines of a representative government and concede that the population has a right to disagree with the established trends and change the direction of their nations?  So far all I have seen is people wondering how to ""correct"" all these burgeoning nationalists, who are all clearly in the wrong. Clearly. It comes across as supremacist to assume the other party is less intelligent, or rationale, than oneself. No we actually can't tell, if the US voted that way people that don't vote in safe states would have come out to vote and the majority would have gone to either side. This is why winning the popular vote in an election for an electorate isn't an accurate representation of popularity either.  I was talking solely about the migrant issue.   Greece caused much of their debt themselves, you're right there.  The UK, France, and Germany are all way more influential. I was in the UK for the AV vote, real shame that didn't go through. It wouldn't have gotten you to proportional representation, but better than the system you have now :( There is no communistic country in the world, definitely not in Europe..your point? Federation in EU will only happen through out big crisis. Even if NATO breaks apart I think we need a proper military conflict to born federation.   Who would have thought that nations of different cultures, ethnicities, languages, and religions would not want to unify? Didn't Yugoslavia go so well? I know right, this is exactly my sales pitch for a more united EU, but Russian backed and supported populists are already causing havoc in 5 countries, and have succesfully pushed GB out of the EU, so the coming elections and years are going to be of vital importance for our future and our dependency on the USA Unfortunately, very few of those 500 million want to fight, based in recent polling. Outside of Japan, Germany has the lowest population willing to fight for their country. A bunch of EU countries are right after Germany on that list.   The Polish would actually lead any military engagement or alliance post EU. And they will always be a US ally, EU or not. The ties are too deep for even eight years if Trump to unravel.  The EU won't exist in five years. Possibly by 2020. And they will have themselves, and demographic realities to blame. Where'd you get that number from? According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_European_Union the population of the EU is 510.1 million. I'd gladly pay funding if it eliminates the need for Russian language courses, and you know, bullets in my face So Europe is not giving military support to you in the missions in Iraq and Afghanistan?  Seems like we're all paying together aren't we?  How does it feel to be on ALL of the lists, lol. He already is! The sanctions against them are all but reversed, and he's talking about increased trade to them.   Next will be the US abandoning or dissolving NATO. Well, then let's hope Trump provides lots of aid to Russia. Quickly too, while the US still exists. [NATO is funded almost overwhelmingly (Roughly 75 percent) by the United States.](http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_07/20160704_160704-pr2016-116.pdf) You'll want Table 4. No, the worst Trump can do is not just pull out of NATO, but become an ally of Russia. > how is trump destroying NATO? I'm pretty sure that's beyond the reach of an EO. But seriously, how is he destroying it?  I didn't say he is. The words ""gets around to"" mean something. He has left it open that the US would not respect its duty if a member invokes article 5 because that member didn't spend their share in defence.  > Why would he provide aid to russia after destroying NATO?  Who does he like more? Putin or the European leaders?  > you're writing alarmist fiction and you were actually upvoted for it. It's the exact social mechanism that sells tabloid trash to idiots.   I prefer the term pessimistic cynic. If the US sides with Russia, the rest of NATO combined doesn't stand a lick of a chance. But isn't the reason EU's economy is so strong is because they don't spend hundreds of billions of euros on the upkeep of a military. They are able to spend money on social programs and furthering the infrastructure of their own countries without worries about foreign invaders because the US is protecting them. If I'm mistaken please correct me. ~~Afghanistan, cleaning up Chernobyl, sunbathing on the gulf of riga, having an economy based on using their resources and the factories of their vassals.~~ Actually, they were going for independence from the USSR. I shit you not, they celebrate it. Not all Russians of course, but the USSR wasn't all that great for Russians either. I'm not afraid for Germany or France from a military standpoint. There are a lot of former Soviet republics and imperial territory where green men and fake referenda can do a lot of damage though. Didn't Germany put up a fight against them during WW2? I dunno my history well, I might be wrong. What it comes down to is that European nations need to act. They need to find some way to stop Russia's war on Ukraine, otherwise Russia will continue trying to get away with things, and it will escalate.   They should find a way to do it without the US. They are the ones that live in Europe, they are the ones that have to deal with the consequences and should therefore be the ones that make the decisions. The US should take a backseat. We can support them in some ways but shouldn't be the ones deciding the policy.  Historically we were the only ones with guns and technology. Also a much larger share of world population.   Nowadays former colonies are the ones on top and on the rise. Power isn't forever.   Not that I want a European world order back. Just the means to defend our quality of life.  Come on, France won't leave the European Union anytime soon. I urge you to get ready to laugh at Marine Le Pen's pitiful score after the second round of the presidential election (May 7), assuming she even makes it that far. France isn't a nation of eurosceptics, we're profoundly European. The last and only time her party made it to the second round of the presidential election was in 2002 and their candidate (Marine Le Pen's father) lost to Jacques Chirac, 82.21% against 17.79%. Most of Europe will still be dependent on the US if internal cooperation ceases. That said, I don't know the big power politics at work. Fact is that Trump has made derisive statements about the EU and his apppointed ambassador likens it to the USSR and says he will work to bring it down. Yes, although I would add US to that prior to their involvement. can you bench press 2 mitt romneys?  We've had most of these things for the last 50~ years. You could apply these to ANY administration. A majority of those do not line up with trump. They line more up with Clinton. Take a second and use your mind.   Which ones in particular do I disagree with? He's not racist or sexist. I haven't seen it other than the grab her right in the pussy. He's actually cool with the LGBT community. He has no controlled over mass media. The first  The fear... The things I'm afraid of now are the left extremists who believe they are doing the right thing and causing significant violence in support of sharia law which is sexist.   I believe in proof. Is there proof? Do you have the proof he is these things? I'd like to see them That's what I am saying, China isn't some liberal lalaland Well the problem with that is that the EU parliament won't be 100% in touch with local needs as much as politicians that are working out of the area. That is why devolution in the Scottland and Northern Ireland was so popular.  I see. The OP was a little confusing in that it was said he wanted to abandon nation-state parliaments, which I assume he means ask for their transfer of power rather than dissolution.  >""unified sovereignty"" an elite group of people managing their own interest  Well this is unprovable.  >who are not chosen by the people, taking more and more regulations from nuanced countries and normalizing them over all the countries and create fake 'for the greater good' laws.  If you believe that, answer the following questions:  1. What country are you from?   2. How do you select your cabinet?   3. How do you select your PM/President?   4. Do you know how the Commission is selected? (Hint: it involves your elected head of state selecting 1-2 commissioners depending on your country).  5. Do you know how the President of the Commission is selected?   6. Do you know how laws are passed in the EU? ...where does that have him describing them as a threat? Want to try again?  It's literally the only claim that you made that could be vindicated. So you're making assumptions? No it's not, the differential between core and periphery EU states is much bigger than in US states.  >Since polls that said more American would vote for,Hillary were spot on  Bullshit. National polls are meaningless. State polls are what most pollsters based their predictions on. All the PA, WI and MI polls were off by 10-20 points. The polls were garbage. Plain and simple. >didn't account for how those votes would be distributed.  No they didn't account for Hillary saying fuck the midwest.  The night before he election they said Trump had a 5-10% chance of winning. Polls for brexit on the day it happened showed remain over 5 points ahead.  But if you wanna underestimate the right wing again go ahead #[Hillary Clinton so far ahead in polls, she 'doesn't even think about Donald Trump anymore'](http://i.imgur.com/RG3E6FJ.png) Lepen has a lot of votes because it's ideas are more unique than other political parties, if you want to leave europe you don't have a lot of choice, Lepen or JLM but if you want economic liberalism there is fillon, macron and even Valls on the left somewhat, it's simplistic but it's a good exemple, at the 2nd round the votes will merge in favor of Fillon/Macron (probably) now there is still time for scandals until the election. Never. JLM's electors are very very anti right-wing. They will go to Hamon or at a last resort Macron.  Spain is never going to be like Germany.  The cultural differences and love of the good life are always going to get in the way.  On the other hand, I bet Spanish people are a lot happier than Germans.  This is not the period to be calling your shots like that. But brexit was trailing by a few percent and then it won so surely literally ANYTHING can happen!  /s  > The popular vote in the US election was within statistical error for nation wide polls so neither were that much of a surprise.   Bullshit. We never cared for the national polls anyway. It was the state polls that were total garbage. EVERY pollster put Clinton around 10 points ahead in PA, WI and MI.   Not such a bad idea these days. If in a cave you at least get the chance of stumbling across some tasty Roquefort. Yum. There's two areas that seem to be the focus of discontent if you're prepared to believe polling.   The first of these concerns economic management and the Euro. To some extent, in terms of the answers we needn't perhaps have to look that much further than Jean Claude Juncker himself who said:  We all know what to do, we just don't know how to get re-elected after we've done it   Juncker was talking about austerity and the need for some of Europe's lower productivity members to move closer to Germany. The problem here is that Germany is the outlier. Only a handful of Eurozone countries can really live with her. The Euro works well for Germany though. It incorporates productivity from poorer performing economies in its value, which obviously hands Germany a backdoor devaluation and gives her export competitiveness. For other countries the reverse of the same dynamic bites. Italy hasn't seen GDP growth over the term of their membership of the single currency. German productivity in the value of the currency damages them  The second area is not surprisingly the potential incendiary issue of immigration. It isn't clear to me if this is so-called 'refugee crisis' or the expansion of the union to include the A8 countries  To some extent the genesis of the post industrial economy possibly has its roots in Japan who first began to exploit the possibility of cheaper products by using South Korea as a manufacturing base in the 1960's. The initial belittling of the quality of their products started to abate in the 1970's as people began to realise that they were actually quite good. In the early 80's America in particular was suffering under a massive trade deficit with Japan.   US industry had begun coming out of its traditional heartlands in the 1960's anyway, but this accelerated in the 1980's. It might be trendy to blame NAFTA, but the process was under way long before NAFTA formalised it and allowed companies to locate in Mexicon to achieve a cost saving and to try and restore competitiveness  The EU was the bloc getting left out of this. In the 1980's lower cost countries such as Span, Portugal, and Greece became members, but they were hardly on the same scale. The union briefly looked at North Africa, (I believe Morocco explored making an application). It wasn't obvious how Europe might respond, and then they were handed a lifeline as the Soviet Union collapsed and released the Warsaw pact countries  By now Japan had started to rope in China as the standard of living in South Korea had risen and with it the demand for wages. To some extent we are in a race to the bottom. China themselves have emerged and might have correctly worked out that the bottom is actually Africa and been moving to secure favourable terms there for the last decade.   Europe? Who knows how they respond? The EU is still very much frozen in some of its historical priorities. Agriculture (a legacy of 1950's France) is still protected and prioritised. Trade deals have also tended to focus on manufactured goods. Services, which is where the UK economy has its loading, have been comparatively neglected. The EU could well begin to lose competitiveness before long. Germany has perhaps begun to try and crack the whip a bit and implore them to move more dynamically towards concluding trade deals, but really, the organisation isn't particularly well set up for it in terms of working culture or structure  Ultimately if the economies of Europe don't start to improve, and if the refugees keep coming, I don't see how this will end well. We are bound to see a slow erosion as people begin to lose faith it what remains a laudable aspiration. The European Council needs to bang some heads together to win a game that no one was playing means nothing.    I know dozens of people who didnt vote because the state was already locked in.  Except that Clinton's popular vote margin is an indication of big margins in ""safe states"" which could make the crucial difference in a run-off election. She was also leading by much more than the final tally in most national polls, so odds are that higher voter turnout would have favored her over Trump. You seem to be assuming that just because there are two possibilities (Clinton fairing better versus worse) that they must be equally likely, but that's not the case. Cuba, China, laos, North Korea and Vietnam. Your statement is that the EU is the most left in the world. I have listed 5 communist countries to show you they are clearly not and far from it. Germany and Italy were formed by dozens of separate countries with different cultures and languages until 150ish years ago. Yet now they're not only unified, but also some of the richest and strongest countries in the world. > and have succesfully pushed GB out of the EU  Let's be frank here, the GB pushed itself out first and foremost. Its media have been united in their anti-EU stance for at least two decades and its political class was even more ham-fisted in the way they absued the EU as a token in their domestic politik games than the rest of the Union. Their domestic interest groups touted their missappropiation of EU funds and their success at undermining the words and the spirits of EU regulations as their one big feature in probably not just one case. Nationalism, in any country, is the surest way to reduce a nations power.  The US dominated the globe not because it was singularly powerful, but because its alliance network was unstoppable.  The same is true for Europe.  It's a shame watching such mighty nations shoot their feet so foolishly. Blame everything on Russia. It already helped so much. Huh, I stand corrected. I looked it up a while ago, not sure where that number came from. Maybe I just misremembered. Still substantially more than US and Russia combined, which is about 470.9 million. I feel like the list is becoming far, far too long to be actionable. well, if you subscribe to r/funny , youre already on them I doubt he is because I'm pretty sure all the agency hate trump at this moment  to be fair if the USA is not able or willing to actually come to the defense of Nato countries like Lithuania then teh USA should pull out of the Union. One of the worst things you can do is promise you will go to war for someone and then not do it. Its much less bad IMO for the US to pull out of NATO then not actually be prepared to uphold the treaty.  To be clear, Table 4 (titled **Table 4: Gross domestic product**) in your link is a list of the Real and per capita GDPs of European nations, the US, and Canada.    If you combine data from Tables 3 and 4, you find that **NATO - Europe** spends $262B per year on defense, while the US spends $677B.   Combining that knowledge with historical data, you'd find that US defense spending is at a roughly 30-year high; it was $400B/year before we started two unfunded wars in the Middle East.  Combining data on EU military spending, you'd find that the next largest defense spender after the EU is China, with $146B/year in 2016.  You might consider that the US defense budget is so high because we are attempting to be at two-front readiness, i.e. able to take on Russia and China at the same time, while also being engaged in MENA.    You might consider that the US has hundreds of overseas bases projecting force that Europe does not desire to.  You then might consider that NATO/the EU's biggest threat is Russia, and that Russia defense spending has completely collapesd in the last three years, from $70B a year to $50B in 2016.  Put all of that nuance together, and you might come to the realization that the EU probably spends enough on defense. Yes, but Europe is perfectly capable of picking up the tab. The US has contributed extravagantly to NATO in exchange for keeping Europe solidly in its sphere of influence. The issue has never been that Europe cannot defend itself if it needs to. It can. Do you think the US will invade Serbia with Putin or something? [removed] You're slightly mistaken. EU countries in general have enough military to protect their country although not to project force outwards generally (Other than a couple thousand soldiers for peacekeeping ,training and joint interventions). But welfare spending for, say, France is around 30% and military spending 2.1%. US ,military spending is 3 percent. Military may cost billions, but welfare costs trillions.  Although at the same time IIRC the US government does spend more per capita on healthcare than most western european countries, which points to the fact that this isn't simply a money issue, but more complex.  Edit: Additionally it probably isn't the foreign aid or UN funding, as percentage the us spends less than several other european countries, so it's unlikely that's such a huge moneysink as Trump lead people to believe.   Edit2: figures as percentage of gdp, must have deleted that part accidentally. >  I shit you not, they celebrate it.  Well, there is [Russia Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_Day) , but it's not exactly independence day. It was advertised like one for a short while, but never had such name officially. It's more of RSFSR becoming RF day. Which one exactly? Estonia? Lithuania? Poland? There's no chance in hell that UK/France/Germany would let Russia just waltz into those countries. Those are NATO members. Even if hell freezes over and both NATO and the EU dissolve overnight, decades of alliances and relationships doesn't just disappear.  Ukraine was isolated and weak with no close allies and right next to Russia. They were also openly hostile against Russian interests. There is no other former soviet bloc country in Eastern Europe like that. The only neighboring non-NATO countries left in East Europe are Belarus and Finland, and Belarus is basically Russia's Canada while Finland isn't soviet. Actually finland might have reason to worry but they're not part of the whole nationalistic ""they were USSR so they belong to us!"" thing. They're also an EU member for what it's worth.   >Historically we were the only ones with guns and technology  Only since the 15th century That doesn't reassure me. It sounds a lot like ""Brexit will never happen"" and ""President Trump will never happen."" Doesn't make it any less wrong. OK, a rant: There is certainly a libertarian <-> authoritarian continuum. The list above can be understood as the attributes that accompany authoritarianism.  For the past (insert arbitrary length of time) here our government has been more or less somewhere in the middle of that continuum -- not perfectly libertarian, and not perfectly authoritarian.  Trump has been completely up front about wanting to shove hard in a more authoritarian direction -- and his stances line up with the above list.  Just because government hasn't been a perfect libertarian utopia does not somehow make it OK for a leader to move the needle hard towards increased authoritarianism. > Take a second and use your mind.  Translation: Keep thinking until your values change and you're on board with us.  > Take a second and use your mind.  No, I've been doing that since the start of the election. I'm not gonna rethink my values, my at this point armor-plated values, everytime some deluded rightwinger decides they don't like them. Your turn to think. Yeah and don't even get me started on *racism* over there.  Well, one could argue the same for the US, but as far as I understand, senators are from each State, and they have a local government that must obey to federal laws, but is otherwise independent.   Now, the only problem I see is that we would not get a European system, but a German system. It's like today the leader of europe is Angela Merkel, instead of whoever the fuck is the leader of the European government. The fact that I don't even know his name or if he exists speaks about what's wrong with the system as it is, and while I don't condone the actions of the UK, I certainly can understand their dissatisfaction, which is 100% german made.  Don't ever take OP's word for things.   from [this interview](http://en.theeuropean.eu/guy-verhofstadt--2/8168-guy-verhofstadt-about-his-vision-for-europe)  >Verhofstadt: ...The alternative I am offering is a Europe that is only active when it can create added value. > >The European[european elections magazine]: A selective Europe. > >Verhofstadt: Absolutely. We need greater subsidiary within the EU. Nobody wants a European super-state. Issues that nations can decide for themselves should be resolved on a national or local level and not in Brussels. But we need greater cooperation and harmonization when it comes to the crucial political and economic decisions, otherwise we wont stand a chance against the Chinese, the Indians, or the Americans. It is a truth that many are afraid to spell out.   No, I can read between the lines. Yeah, I get pissed at the rust belt for Trump a lot, but then I remember the best argument I saw on a video from a blue-collar family from Michigan (or Wisconsin?). They basically said that Hillary didn't visit the area once, and Trump did several times.  So yeah, I don't think there are very many valid reasons to vote for Trump, but when your area's economy is hurting and only one candidate visits, you kinda have to assume that candidate is going to work more for your interests. Well Fillon is currently in the eye of a hurricane size scandal so he's pretty much finished, that more than likely leaves Macron. Valls lost the primary to Hamon. Hamon is less liberal than him and will take votes from JLM, MLP and some Valls supporters.  Indeed, and the sun is shining there almost all the time. And the people are nice.  Germany is made of rain and taxes. Nothing else. That's it.   Help. When I (German) was in Spain, the people there were so incredibly nice, especially to my baby boy, I honestly at first thought ""Of course they're nice to me at this hotel, they're being paid for it. But they could do it in a little more believable, less over-the-top manner."" But then I noticed that people were like that everywhere. Even the fucking security agent at the gate went back through the gate just to pet my kid, leaving the line waiting at the unattended scanner.  This would never happen in Germany. (Although I have to say, people are very understanding, accepting and helpful - almost open! - if they see you with a baby. Especially if you're a cute father ) Could be but consider my point here , I'm half Spanish half Mexican and i have lived for more than 2 years each in more than 5 countries and what i learned was that i consider myself no country i try to grab the best of each country and culture and apply it to myself , if in Spain the majority of income comes from tourism (Ibiza, etc...) and the good life why cat we also apply the worj ethic of germany?  Why would you mock people for being skeptic?  Agreed.  > You seem to be assuming that just because there are two possibilities (Clinton fairing better versus worse) that they must be equally likely, but that's not the case.  No, what I'm saying is, that there's too much variance and uncertainty in trying to extrapolate the results of a electoral vote election into a popular vote election, that it would overshadow Clinton's 2% popular lead, and the chances of either side winning are too indefinite to call. Unless you can provide a good argument for why you can make this extrapolation accurately I don't see how you can say for certain that Clinton had a much greater chance of winning. Remember this election had a 58% turnout, and a poplar vote difference of 2%, we really can't be certain what would have happened to the popular vote if a completely different type of voting was used.    China, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam? Really? What is communistic about this countries?  And Cuba is a MarxistLeninist one-party republic according to Wikipedia not communism.  Of course you will not find a communistic country because it is practically impossible for a communistic country to exist in a capitalistic system. But the American perception that somehow China is communism or North Korean just shows how utterly uneducated people are and clearly do not have a clue what communism is.  Please refer to this chart: http://www.diffen.com/difference/Communism_vs_Socialism The various German and Italians states were clearly much closer together than the various southern Slavs or Germans and Poles are. > The US dominated the globe not because it was singularly powerful, but because its alliance network was unstoppable.  It also helped that after WWII and the Cold War it was effectively the *only* superpower, until the more recent rise of China as an economic juggernaut, and the rebuilding of Europe and Britain.  > The US dominated the globe not because it was singularly powerful, but because its alliance network was unstoppable.  I wouldn't say that.  Yes the United States is stronger because of it's close allies.  However, even without them, the United States is the strongest nation in the world.  You cannot deny that fact. The us dominated the globe because we controlled all of the tools post ww2, the un, the imf, the world bank. Based on the number of successful/unsuccessful assassination attempts in history, it would seem they're fairly effective at sorting out who can be dealt with via a letter and who needs to be dealt with by kicking doors in.  Back from my cop days I made acquaintances at a lot of the alphabet agencies and I can tell you very few if any of the folks I know are unhappy or vocally so, anyways.   Military folks especially are thrilled with him so far. Not surprising though, republicans always seem to be much more pro-military as far as general appearances go.  I'm not entirely disagreeing with you, but I think the US belongs in NATO for a damn good reason and we need to get out of our own asses and started remembering that.  Oh wait, our president is a stooge for Putin, never fucking mind.... Russia doesn't need to invade Serbia. Serbs will happily invite them in and ally with them. I think that if there were an armed conflict between Europe and Russia, Trump will provide at least intelligence aid to Putin. Russia doesn't need to 'waltz in.'  Have you not been paying attention?  Russia's strategy with western aligned nations is to fund rightwing fascist movements to destabilize nations from within. > here's no chance in hell that UK/France/Germany would let Russia just waltz into those countries  Look at the geography. All three countries could fall in a matter of days, if not weeks. NATO would start a war knowing that the Baltics are already occupied. Nope, but it's not unique to trump either. This makes way too much sense and is far from extreme. Why are so many Europeans afraid to unify their sovereignty? It's the only way to compete with the global super powers, and your lives would be the better of it to boot. Eh, Clinton visited Pennsylvania many times. I question how much voters really care. I suspect it's more a case of people making up their minds, and then trying to come up with reasons to justify their decision after the fact. I think it looks really bad right now, but we don't have enough informations to say he is finished > Germany is made of rain and taxes. Nothing else. That's it. >   Do you even Wurst, bru? Life expectancy is also a [bit higher](http://one-europe.net/eurographics/life-expectancy-in-europe) in Spain. I'm not saying we can be certain, I'm saying one outcome (a better outcome for Clinton) is more likely the the other given everything we know. It's more likely for the reasons I outlined before and others (under-performing national polls, fairing disproportionately well in ""safe states"", having obtained a plurality under the system we do have, all indications that higher turnout would work in her favor).  So unless there are similarly good reasons to believe Trump would have done significantly better under an alternative system it seems reasonable to conclude Clinton would stand the better chance. How much better is difficult to say, but I'm confident in saying she'd stand a better chance of winning. Why are you straying from your original point? You stated the EU is the most left leaning in the world. All I'm saying is it is not and gave you 5 examples of socialist and maxists systems (if you want to be specific) which clearly shows the EU is not as left. Perhaps center-left leaning but they are still capatlists with only minor social focus.   You make it seem like a exteme left views don't lead to totalitarianism. Which I am sure you are aware that they do and just as much as the right. It's easy to come out on top when the War was fought more or less entirely inside the other great powers' borders, decimating their industries and infrastructures. That's absolutely true.  But the world isn't devastated anymore. I would be honored to receive such a letter.      Less so to have my door kicked in. I really doubt that.  And how will they annex anything without putting boots on the ground?  Also, hand out passports, destabilize from within, and fund opposition, it works wonders, in fact the people will become Russian and let you in even. Except the ""right-wing fascist movements"" in countries like Ukraine who even put the standard of National Socialist iconography on their flags like the Black Sun are militantly anti-Russia. Are you seriously suggesting that NATO would allow Russia to conquer it's members and just shrug it off? Russia would be spanked back into the stone age if that ever happened.  Also you're seriously underestimating the former soviet bloc. Poland especially is no joke militarily. Russia is not the military power it used to be. It took a month just to annex the single, very pro Russian region of Crimea.  So the trend has existed yet now accelerated, but who cares, it's existed before so what's a little more in the wrong direction... That's like missing your exit 5 miles ago and saying ""oh well that was 5 miles ago, I'll just keep on going since nothing else went wing in the last 5 miles.""  Pennsylvania is not in the Midwest Have you ever considered anyone actually voted for Trump because of his policies instead of thinking it was a mistake when looking back?  PA is a different story.   We are talking about Michigan and Wisconsin which Hillary ignored badly, she thought Trump was wasting time there.  She lost PA because its been trending that direction the past 4 elections and it finally went red. Hillary also attacked the coal industry which is huge in PA she only went to philly, ignored the rest of pennsylvania.  No it does not seem statistically reasonable, there are some theories to suggest it, but it's not a conclusion. Polls are known to overrepresent urban and hence liberal votes, look up ""shy Tory effect"", especially in controversial elections.   >fairing disproportionately well in ""safe states"", having obtained a plurality under the system we do have, all indications that higher turnout would work in her favor).  Any evidence for this? How can you make a good guess on who didn't show up based on who did?  That is what should keep the US strong. We don't have to worry about Kentucky attacking Ohio. We don't even really need to worry about Mexico or Canada.  I think Trump (and I'm guessing Putin) wants us to be a pre World War United States. We'll broker and build for Europe's wars while staying ""neutral"".  A strong(er) EU wouldn't be bad for the Allies though. I don't know. Look at Trump's communication in regards to Putin vs. all of the European leaders. Who does he appear to like more? ""Elections"" to join Russia in places with already pro-Russian populations, like Belarus With Puppets and ventriloquist dummies. I don't think they necessarily want to annex, but rather have satellite nations that are under Putin's control. IIRC didn't Crimea have a vote to rejoin Russia?  That's one way to do it, 'democratically'. When was the last time the US needed to annex a country to establish dominance over it? It has been running wars and subvert operations for decades without expanding on its territory while creating a global hegemony.  Just because they're not participating in your government doesn't mean they can't be under your control... A few one sided trade deals, a few skewed elections in Democratic nations, and who cares if [non-Russian-state] isn't under your direct rule, they're still funneling goods into Russia and not consuming any Russian funds in the process.  Boots on ground annexation is honestly a little last century if you can win the culture war without firing a shot. It happened to some extent in the US, there's not much more than a distrust in Russia in West Europe stopping the same from happening there... You just have to trick enough of a States electorate that helping you is actually helping them and you can reap the rewards of colonization without the burdon of colonizing. >Are you seriously suggesting that NATO would allow Russia to conquer it's members and just shrug it off?   You're putting way too much faith into something that was never actually tested in practice. I have some serious doubts anyone sane would risk a full nuclear exchange over Lithuania.  >It took a month just to annex the single, very pro Russian region of Crimea.  Yeah, because they decided to do that bloodlessly. And they did it. It was quite impressive tbh. But it is part of the Rust Belt and flipped for Trump in an upset that essentially decided the election in the EC. > How can you make a good guess on who didn't show up based on who did?   I'm not really guessing about that. I'm assuming there's no significant difference between the population that voted and the one that didn't in terms of partisan distribution, because I have little reason to believe otherwise. Bear in mind, this should *help Trump* at this point since there are more registered Democrats than Republicans. If literally everyone showed up then Clinton would do even better than she did.  Meanwhile, if we're going to get into the question of who was left over, Trump's support has from the very beginning been narrow but deep. He has an intensely supportive base and, at best, lukewarm support outside of it. It therefore seems unlikely that many more Trump supporters than Clinton supporters were waiting on the sidelines in ""safe states."" Passionate people show up whether they think it ultimately ""counts"" or not.  It's just generally more difficult to come up with a scenario in which Trump would win the popular vote. Of course, it's far from impossible. It's just *less likely* than the alternative.

Yeah....they're SAYING that....how many actually DO IT will be another story! That's just insane behaviour to me. I wouldn't let a stranger of any nationality live inside my home, especially if I have children. Are there any numbers on how many people this will affect,  it's my understanding that there isn't actually that many people needing places to stay.  Nice gesture from these people but just wonder how many in Canada stranded.   Edit: I cannot find a single stranded person needing a place to stay.  And they don't even let me transit through Canada. WTF :( Can smeone reminds me, what did canada do when Obama banned Iraqi refugees from entering America for a full 6 months that one time that no one is talking about (or knows about)? Funny seeing all the negativity towards this. But was Operation Yellow Ribbon any different? Or was it ok because most of those folks were White Christian American Citizens who ended up being welcomed with open arms by the Citizens of Canada.  30,000+ Mostly US Citizens assisted during the aftermath of 9/11...  perhaps according to some of you...we should have turned our backs on you and locked our doors. I wish we could be like Canadians. what about they own homeless ? Why are Canadians not opening homes to the poor? The homeless? Giving them help first?  When a plane is dropping its breathing masks, it tells you to put your mask on first.  Why is that?  I am not dying do not help, I am saying help locally in your community first.   No thanks. If you have no direct ties to a country you have no rights to demand to get in. Simple as that. Sorry.  6 out of the 7 Countries banned Israelis and there is no uproar over that or the fact Obama had several of these and no one complained.  In fact Trump used Obama's list of countries of threat level assessment. I hope none of them get raped or murdered like the people in Europe who took them in... Be careful. Next they will expect you to pay for their housing and food and education and protest your way of life despite everything you have done for them...Oh wait. You go Canada! Nope you already steal enough money from me. How about they just buy them a care package instead? Its much cheaper and safer for everyone. I live in Seattle, my sister and her family lives in Vancouver. Those people look and act so much happier then Americans  Then the Americans roll into the thread and start arguing and startin shit... fuck sakes  I kind of agree. If only the government was on the same level. For the recent years, I have to say that the government didn't make me proud to be a Canadian. But this remind me the Canada I grew up in as I was a child. As an American, it pains me to my soul to have to agree with you.  My brothers to the north are indeed, kinder and more generous.  WTF happened to my country?  =( Shouldn't be too proud, one of your fellow citizens just shot up a mosque. One or more of these Muslims will kill a Canadian. Think about it.  More power to them  [In the aftermath of 9/11, Gander, a very small Newfoundland town, played host to thousands of American passengers stranded following the closure of US airspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Yellow_Ribbon). At the time, it was presumed that these people would be grateful and pay that kindness forward.  Lesson learned, though.  I'm not sure but I think Canadians have been been welcoming to Syrian refugees for example, or at least it's seemed that way.  I dunno the 50 000 syrian refugees Canada has taken in so far seem to be doing pretty well. Don't assume American racism/ignorance spreads to other places just because the accents are similar They've [been](http://www.Refugees.com/ Encounter a Foreign Word: Welcome http://nyti.ms/29hkC2k) [doing ](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/22/world/americas/canada-refugees-syria.html) that for a while now.  Sit.down. After 9/11, Canadians housed those trapped in Canada due to flight restrictions in the US. its just the kind of people we are. helping those in need.  That's cool. We will pick up the slack. Then don't. We will.   Keep your fear on your side of the border.    that's because you're a coward. most people are good people and they have kids too. Exactly!!!!...but they expect every American to do it by having open porous borders.  That looks to have a been a totally different situation:  http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/01/30/sorry-mr-president-the-obama-administration-did-nothing-similar-to-your-immigration-ban/  Main points (about the 2011 situation):  1. Much narrower focus  2. Not a ban  3. Grounded in specific threat  4. Orderly, organized process  5.

There are shelters and various welfare programs in Canada for homeless Canadians too. homelessness is a complex problem that often has more to do with mental illness, abuse and addiction issues rather than financial resources. It isn't a problem that's open to a simple solution like providing housing, as there needs to be long term support and education to help people work through their challenges and successfully integrate into society. I used to work for a Canadian government unit responsible for monitoring and trying to eliminate homelessness so I have first had knowledge of the problem. Are you aware that people can do more than one thing? because we pay for organizations to look after them for us. and some of those people choose to not be helped. educate yourself Cause these are stranded travelers that would be here for a short while. Not a homeless person who would be there for a long while. Very different  People do also do that. Issue for homelessness is complex. Providing temperory housing is pretty different from providing long term housing for chronic homeless people. For that governmental housing and shelters are the main solution. Also some people choose to be homeless despite avaliable shelters and housing How about you stop being so cynical and trying to destroy those that have the courage to help others? There is no vetting system for the Homeless, but there is for Refugees. A lot of homeless people have mental health issues or some sort of addiction. That's typically hard to deal with for anyone not trained.. Refugees just need safety and shelter. >  the 7 Countries band Israelis  You mean ""banned"".  Hope you get an education instead of doubling down on your fear of muslims.  Surely not, people in Europe weren't selected... Considering that not all of the people locked there are refugees. Some might be simply people who lived in the US and can't go back home because they are from a banned country.  > Next they will expect you to pay for their housing and food and education and protest your way of life despite everything you have done for them...Oh wait.  Uh, we already do pay for food, housing, education and health care for refugees.... WE WANT TO. It's cold up here in Canada. Where are they going to stay? Hotels are certainly not the ""cheaper"" way to do it. Safety is a concern, but I think if you help someone in need, they wouldn't do anything bad for you. Safer than what? They're all in the country legally. >  I have to say that the government didn't make me proud to be a Canadian.   How come? Can't say I've felt the same way. This is such a bullshit narrative and circle jerk on Reddit. I was just up in Canada on business last week and had some Canadians tell me how glad they were we elected Trump. Reddit does not represent Canada or the US. Americans can learn a thing or two from Canada's extremely strict immigration policies. Working class people are stupid and keep getting divided over race and other little things. When in reality the working class would be better to come together and vote for someone who has their best interest at heart     >My brothers to the north are indeed, kinder and more generous.    Ye bro, all Canadians are literal reincarnations of Mother Teresa and all Americans are spawns of satan  We have racists, murderers, and assholes, too. I think the difference is how we handle it. Ya we don't really get bated by fear quite like American do. In the last 10years we've had 2 ""terrorist"" attacks.. both have been by white guys born in Canada. On top of that Canada let's in 300,000 immigrants every year.. not a single one has been radicalized. So no!  we don't fear our Muslim neighbours.. Apologies, and not to take away from the wonderful act that was, but Gander isn't exactly a 'very small town'. It's one of 3 city centers on the island.

Im Canadian and can confirm. Most are demoralized and want to return to middle east. America has more racial diversity than any other nation on this planet.  We do not have 50k Syrian refugees. Where the fck did you pull out that number from? Your arse?   Congrats, you're willing to roll the dice by letting strangers into your home, so noble, wow Good for you, don't come crying when someone gets raped. Or because I can't even support myself. That really doesn't get rid of the problem, just alleviates some of the symptoms.   But besides that, I don't see many people running through the streets helping the homeless get back on their feet. So it's kind of a rough-shod argument against taking in refugees. but why are they homeless sky high house prices fueled by interest from non canadians  And illegal immigration is also a problem. Just because the previous administration did not uphold the law does not mean what trump is doing is wrong.   Ohh please. What is your nations unemployment rate???  Then tell me that you can do more than 1 thing.    Wow. That is an amazing ""media""reply.   ""Choose not to be helped "".   Wait I have another one ""Americans don't want those types of jobs"".   The homeless choose to be homeless"".   Yep all true.    I guess when google refused to pay the EU all those billions in taxes so that the EU  can help people.  That was ok. Right? Just business.    Go ahead bring them into your homes.      Glad nothing bad will happen to these good people :) No we don't.  Almost 20 trillion in debt, the buck has to start stopping somewhere. I know, still wouldnt want a stranger in my home. Well, I guess it all started when we went to Afghanistan. Then Paul Martin and then we had Stephen Harper. I'd say that even if Stephen Harper didn't have a case against him... Foreign relation just simply got worse overtime. I can't say much about how it evolved within the country because I haven't been much there for so long...All I can say is that it's getting harder to get much help for papers..  I remember how Harper got the votes and I might be too young to compare with previous leader but I remember how the strategy in the ads were...""This person is shit, how can he become a president... vote for me"".   As for the operations in Afghanistan... It wasn't our war and it's hard to say if our actions there actually changed anything.   And then what's worry me the most is our relation with Russia. It doesn't make sense for me to see how our government is so aggressive against Russia and how much it doesn't try to make our relations better. Our Embassy in Moscow is a sad to see.   A project to make economical ties between Russia and Quebec got shut down (before anything related with Ukraine)... So it's not even related with sanctions or anything... Since 2010 at least, on the embassy's website it's clearly written ""if you go out of the Moscow region, you're on your own... our help is limited or non-existent"".  I personally believe that our current policy against Russia doesn't project the way I grew up. It's like Trudeau recently (not so recently) told that once he'll see Putin he'll tell him what he's thinking... I don't recall them meeting with each others at the G20... It's not like they couldn't and as far as I know, Putin pretty much welcomed Trudeau because Trudeau sounded much better than Harper. The sad part is that as far as Russia/Putin is tagged badly... I never heard Putin say anything bad about Trudeau/Harper or even Canada... And I don't understand why our government is behaving worse than Russia if Russia is supposed to be worse than Canada.   As for Canadian education, I'm a bit worried that if my child will study in Canada the education will be worse than the education I had as a child. In Quebec, children aren't technically required to pass exams to move to the next grade. It's not clear how more children failing school finishing school is better than having only children that success school to finish it.  I could write forever... but I might be just too young to judge if things got worse or better. I have to admit that Trudeau is a breath of fresh air. I hope he won't fail us.  funny you say that.. maybe I live in echo chamber.. but I haven't met a single Canadian happy about trump other than just for the entertainment factor.   Were you in Medicine Hat or some shit like that? You are correct. Many Canadians support Trump. We have idiots in canada too unfortunately.  Considering it was uneducated white males who put Trump in power, I'm gonna have to say no.  (And before anyone gets defensive, I'm a white male.) Yeah let me know when one of those decide to run for president. Most politicians are in it for themselves regardless of what they tell the public. I guess things are relative, but coming from Ontario, that's a pretty damn small little town they got themselves there.    Gander is not a city. Population of roughly 8000 Let's be honest, you're not likely to do either. Do you have any source for that? Other [sources ](http://nyti.ms/29hkC2k) claim otherwise  Says the brand new troll account. Ah yes, which explains why a refugee family in Thunder Bay has just opened a Donair restaurant. It's obviously so they can construct a rocket beneath that will propel them back to the Middle East. I volunteer with refugees in my city in Canada, and that's blatantly false. Yup, looks like Canada is about 79% European-Canadian and the US is about 72% European-American. (quick Wikipedia search for stats).   To be honest this surprised me. Stats are wonderful.  Canada has the most ethnically diverse cities in the world. Is this one of those ""alternative facts"" I've been hearing about? We have about 40,000 resettled, another 3500 approved on top of that but not yet arrived, and another 15000-17000 or so in the middle of processing.   [It's about 40k as of January 2nd.](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/refugees/welcome/milestones.asp) The number is a little lower, but not by too much. The Canadian government has it at [39,671 in Canada at the moment](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/refugees/welcome/milestones.asp). We have about 40,000 resettled, another 3500 approved on top of that but not yet arrived, and another 15000-17000 or so in the middle of processing. If anybody wants the know the difference between Canada and the US, look no further than the previous two comments. Treat others like you wish to be treated. Your perception of a stranger is a reflection of your own projection and the society you live in. The way you treat them is a refection of yout ethics. Some of us may be naive but then again we don't have a mass shooting everyday Heroes, those Canadians are.  lol coward I take it you aren't Canadian. [removed] Well if you can't support yourself, go where someone can support you! Problem solved. More seriously chances are that the refugee can actually help you too. I do in hamilton. There are support networks to get them back into society.  Your comment is completely non-sequiter to mine. I don't even know how to respond. I didn't mention Trump, anything about right or wrong, or the previous administration. Soooo... good talk! Are you saying that a 6.8% unemployment rate means that everyone in Canada can't possibly do more than one thing at a time?   I help out with nutrition programs for children in poverty from my own city. This didn't prevent me from volunteering to put together care packages for Syrian refugees in my city.   I also have a full time job and some hobbies.  People can do more than one thing.  If you're homeless in any Western country not called ""America"". It's by choice. There are ample programs in almost all of these countries for both feeding and housing the homeless. Unfortunately many people are homeless due to mental illness or addiction and you cannot *force* these people to accept help, no matter how much they need it. Grammar*, and he's right, getting an education might help you out quite a bit. I'm more worried about the people from banned countries actually in the US right now... Now, they're stuck in the US or they're out until the ban is lifted. So anyone who planned a vacation or trip has to cancel everything and it's unclear how the ban affect people actually in the US they're not deported as far as I know.. but still a pretty shitty situation. It must be tiring to be scared all the time. Life's too short to assume everyone is out to get you. You'd be surprised how far a little kindness to others will get you.  Lay off the scarebait news. My family hosted people from abroad throughout most of my life and the worst thing that happened is that it's hard for me to pick which international friend to visit first.  Have a coffee or tea with them first so they aren't stranger anymore.  I know three. Sounds like a lot. But I interact with hundreds of political people. So it is generally hard to find them. What point are you trying to make? Canada and Mexico have extremely strict immigration laws. I think Americans can learn a lot from them. I voted for Trump. I have a college education in a STEM field and am a small business owner. Your false accusation is an expression of the elitism that turned enough people away from your position to elect Trump. Until you can own that, you will have a very rough 8 years. This is true that everyone has some kind of agenda but I'd argue trump a ruthless but successful business man gaining the power of presidency is going to take his agenda and self interest to another level.  Forgetting the middle class all together, yet somehow the red necks will still be all for it. Guess everything is relative. I'm originally from a small area of about 2000 people. Only reason it has that many people is because 4 neighboring towns amalgamated a few years back. The part of this municipality that was once my hometown has about 800 people About 11,000 today. After doing some research, there's no real definition of a city; I thought it was just a population over 10,000 Is it his personal responsibility? What about the remaining 21% and 28%... Asian? Indians? Africans? I'm not sure exactly how you would measure it, but I'm not sure that ""percentage non-white"" is measuring diversity, exactly. Still, it's a relevant point. As of July 2015 white (not Hispanic or Latino) is 61.6% in US  https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/#headnote-js-a Still not 50k. Still no 50k. Oh, my bad then. Last time i checked it was a bit over 25.000. I wanted to reply to you and ask you not to generalize us Americans, but the comments in this thread do little to support that argument. It's sad to see such a divide between us. > Your perception of a stranger is a reflection of **your own projection** and the society you live in.  Let me guess, you're one of those people that thinks external risk isn't a thing?   By saying that any kind of judgement is a reflection of yourself, you remove the rational possibility of judging someone else to be a threat. In other words, you make it irrational to judge another person as dangerous.  I'm all about helping other people out, but saying stupid shit like that means you're not actually thinking about what you're saying.  > don't have a mass shooting everyday  Neither do we. In fact, the last one was on June 12, 2016. Go whine about how alpha you are on /r/incels or something While I think you're 'mostly' correct, there certainly are cases in Canada where people with mental illnesses aren't able to access supports. I don't know about the other provinces, but the Ontario health insurance doesn't pay for any counselling at all, and in Toronto income-adjusted housing has a wait list over a year long.  In addition, I believe there are cases where people who are unable to take care of themselves can get kicked out of income adjusted housing, and it is also not difficult to get kicked off welfare in this province. The Ontario disability support program regularly turns down people with mental illnesses, and even for people with very serious illnesses it can be an extremely difficult and long process to get approved.  Soo... you're right that it is pretty hard to wind up homeless against one's choice in this country, but it definitely can happen for people with mental illnesses. Yes. You are correct. However, you did say ""many people"" not all. So how about helping the rest ?     You really think a nation should not help itself first?  What is the unemployment rate in Canada?  How about helping those workers ?  This is where the laws must be broken, remember the underground railroad? Yes people broke the law, and we should have another underground railroad today to get these people free. Immigration *helps*, not hurts. You've probably heard the term ""brain drain"", which is what happens when educated individuals leave their countries to live and work in another country. Even less-skilled workers are good because they prevent the population size from contracting. Look at Japan; most of their citizens are seniors and there is not enough procreation going on to replace the people who are dying. Without fresh blood, there won't be anyone to support the people who cannot work. 8 years, you say...hmm After a quick google you're right. I didn't realize Gander had 11k. Only cities in NL are St.John's & Mount Pearl. I don't believe Corner Brook is No its not, but few good deeds in life come down to ""personal responsibility""  Dirty statistics. I know I could have been better but the European migration seemed to be as relevant as I could get on short notice. Quick google searches and the like.  You're completely right, that totals up to approximately 60,000 rather than 50,000. Excuse me. 43,500. My apologies. My point is completely and utterly ruined. I will go drown in my tears now, brb If I recall correctly, 25.000 was the number for the solely-government sponsored refugees, while the 40.000 figure accounts for those with a mix of private and public sponsorship as well as those with a completely private sponsorship. >Let me guess, you're one of those people that thinks external risk isn't a thing? By saying that any kind of judgement is a reflection of yourself, you remove the rational possibility of judging someone else to be a threat. In other words, you make it irrational to judge another person as dangerous. I'm all about helping other people out, but saying stupid shit like that means you're not actually thinking about what you're saying.  nope, your comprehension is a bit lacking. I specifically said it reflects BOTH your own projection and the society you live in; Because you know nothing about the person, all the perceived threat you have can only be from you, mostly your understanding of your society and human beings.  It has nothing to do with whether it is rational, you can be rational, but your reasoning can only be based off what you know about the world, not what you know about the stranger, which is again a reflection of your own projection and the society you live in.   >Neither do we. In fact, the last one was on June 12, 2016.  factually false, by any mainstream definition of mass shooting. by US Congress definition, your last one was Jan 6, 2017.   by mass shooting tracker's definition, which is an event where more than 4 people were shot you had 476 mass shooting last year, and 40 this year so far.   You are dumb. Heres why.   ""By saying that any kind of judgement is a reflection of yourself, you remove the rational possibility of judging someone else to be a threat. In other words, you make it irrational to judge another person as dangerous.""  You have never heard of self reflection. At no point did anyone tell you that you have to turn off your ability to perceive danger. But if you see somebody you assume to be dangerous or makes you feel unsafe, you can think about why and see if that is even reasonable.   Perhaps learn something and allow it to affect your decisions. The amazing part is you can think critically and still make decisions that keep you safe and aren't knee jerk fear responses.  But for people like you the world is divided into ""mine"" and ""yours"" and you clearly don't have enough of the first one.  The rest have access to the aforementioned aid programs if they choose to. You seem to be assuming ONLY those that have mental illness or addiction choose to be homeless/unemployed.  I personally believe that a nation should help itself. However, it's not a burden whatsoever to sacrifice a bit of our prosperity and growth to help someone facing a crisis.  Unemployment rate is at ~6.9%. Not ideal but it's hard to gauge at the moment due to all the baby boomers retiring and not enough entry level jobs for the incoming workforce. Are you trying to make a point or are you just giving me a bunch of immigration related trivia? Most communities in Newfoundland are between 500 and 2000 people. There are thousands of these small towns scattered around the coast. They're also fairly grouped together, so it doesn't really feel isolated. There's a 'town' nearby with a population of 337. And there's an area of that town often considered its own town, with 6 inhabitants They are not in Canada yet. What if numbers are just that what if. Typical SJW 2+2=5.  > by any mainstream definition of mass shooting.  Did a little looking, and you're correct. I wasn't aware Congress had designated >4 to be a mass shooting. But I'm still correct that they don't happen every day.  > your reasoning can only be based off what you know about the world, not what you know about the stranger  Since I don't know the stranger, they are part of the world to me. The only thing I have to judge them on is that there is a small, yet ever present chance that they're a psycho or whatever. A complete stranger falls under everything that I know about the general public.  That's why it is more than perfectly fine to deny a complete stranger access to my house, I'm well within my rights and it's shitty of you people to act like I'm being a bad person. I'm just careful and rational.     > knee jerk fear responses.  With only the information available - that a stranger is coming to stay in my house - I would make the same call and decline. I think it's moronic to say that this is a judgement call coming from my ""projections"". I am simply more careful than you are, it's false to dismiss my call as a ""knee jerk fear response"".  Now, if I was able to meet the person and talk with them I might make a different call on letting them stay in my house. >Immigration *helps*, not hurts. > Since I don't know the stranger, they are part of the world to me. The only thing I have to judge them on is that there is a small, yet ever present chance that they're a psycho or whatever. A complete stranger falls under everything that I know about the general public   so you concede it is a combination of your own projection and the society you live in.    > That's why it is more than perfectly fine to deny a complete stranger access to my house, I'm well within my rights and it's shitty of you people to act like I'm being a bad person. I'm just careful and rational.  I already said  > The way you treat them is a reflection of your ethics.   while how much threat you perceive from a stranger does not necessarily have any implication on your ethics, what you do with that perceived threat does. It is a balance between how much threat you think you are under and how much you think your help is needed. At some point it does make you a bad person.   Edit: formatting I guess that's why Mexico is such a shithole? Because they have extremely strict immigration laws?   Nah. It's perfectly rational to not want someone sleeping in my house, and that's not a reflection on my character. If I were vitriolic about it or whatever, then I'd be a bad person.  If they really needed some help there's probably other ways to do it. I wouldn't have a problem giving a fellow traveler $20 to go towards a room or stuff to sleep on.  Now if they're going to be in some sort of danger if they're not inside my house, then yeah I would probably let them in. Like I said, I'm not a dick.  Point is, it's all circumstantial and you never know why someone does what they do.  Edit: no I don't concede that it is a ""projection"" of myself, it is a judgement call based on factual information I have about the public.   I don't understand why you're stuck on this projection thing. Yes, my past experiences with people are part of my decision making process. Are you calling that projecting? Because that's literally how any decision is made ever, about anything. For real.   Like sweet mother of Jesus, I'm not going to shit talk someone who's opening their door for strangers, you're awesome and all that, but if I say I'd rather not do that everyone loses their fucking minds without thinking about *why* someone might not be comfortable with that.  Case in point from /u/guredty:  > people like you the world is divided into ""mine"" and ""yours""  Lol, give me a fucking break. Yeah, I've got autonomy when it comes to me and my property. Shut the fuck up. It's a shit hole because of drug violence. >no I don't concede that it is a ""projection"" of myself, it is a judgement call based on factual information I have about the public. I don't understand why you're stuck on this projection thing. Yes, my past experiences with people are part of my decision making process. Are you calling that projecting? Because that's literally how any decision is made ever, about anything.  seriously, Read these words carefully, without skipping words, and finish the sentence.   **it is a combination of your own projection and the society you live in.**  >Nah. It's perfectly rational to not want someone sleeping in my house, and that's not a reflection on my character. If I were vitriolic about it or whatever, then I'd be a bad person.  rationality on its own have no implication on morality, idk why you are mixing it.   >Now if they're going to be in some sort of danger if they're not inside my house, then yeah I would probably let them in. Like I said, I'm not a dick. Point is, it's all circumstantial and you never know why someone does what they do.   again i have already said   >It is a balance between how much threat you think you are under and how much you think your help is needed. At some point it does make you a bad person.

"31",30,"5r0p9r","2017-01-30","[removed] I don't agree with Trump's travel ban but doesn't literally every country discriminate on nationality by offering visa-free travel to certain countries but not to other countries?  Edit: I'm not claiming that no visa-free travel is the same as a full ban, and nor am I trying to justify the ban. Again I don't agree with it personally. My argument was that the UN's statement doesn't make sense to me. Discrimination on nationality is literally what sanctions are and we do that all the time. You can argue that the ban won't stop terrorism or that its unfair for your average person but you can't argue that this isnt done by other countries all the time. > Discrimination on nationality alone is forbidden  This is what American media seems to ignore. To me, discriminating on something you have no control over is more offensive than discriminating based on religion. But our media seems to just want to label it a Muslim ban and ignore that aspect of this order. [removed] >'Discrimination on nationality alone is forbidden under human rights law'      What the hell are they talking about? Every country on Earth does this and every country on Earth is well within their rights to do this. That's what a border **is**.    There are sixteen countries than do not allow Israeli passports. Algeria, Bangladesh, Brunei, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Malaysia. Oman, Pakistan, Sadi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Why would anyone with half a brain give a fuck what the UN has to say on human rights after they appointed Saudi Arabia to the human rights council?  The UN can fuck right off.  Isn't 'discrimination on nationality' usually just called 'having an immigration policy'?   Oh, and Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein is *Prince* Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein, a Jordanian Hashemite and cousin of the king. If he were that concerned, you'd think he'd have brought up the wall Abdullah built to keep Syrian refugees in the desert and out of Jordan. Glass houses, and all that.  Mean-spirited is the least realistic term in today's climate. While I wholeheartedly agree with the sentiment, calling something forbidden without actually having the means to forbid it undermines what authority the UN actually has. Looking forward to the UN denouncing the 17 countries that ban Israelis The greatest thing about the United States is the Constitution and the greatest thing about the constitution ... it allows the country to change if it wants too.  Something that worked in the past may not work in present or future and people can work towards changing it and/or vote in people who will help change it.  Unfortunately we live in an era where ""yelling"" your point of view means more than your point of view and we are left with a divided country on so many things and I find myself doing the same thing also.  At the end of the day, the country will continue to grow and change  and good things will happen and bad things will happen but at some point every person in the United States needs to come to terms with one massive problem that everyone overlooks everyday in this country...  http://www.usdebtclock.org/  This keeps going up and everyone on the planet seems to expect us to do everything for everyone but the bottom line is we have the highest debt on the planet and we cannot keep ourselves sustained like this if we keep helping everyone out.  It sounds egotistical and mean-spirited but eventually someone else in the world is going to have to pick up the slack and take care of people, take care of financial aid in the billions to most of the countries on the planet.  A lot of Americans are getting tired of people recklessly spending our money all over the world instead of spending it on it's own people.  Our gun violence in the country is outta control, our jails are packed to their limits and beyond, we have homeless people, Veteran problems, unemployment problems yet we're ""always"" the problem when we don't do something for the world.  Maybe the people protesting and the UN should focus more of their attention on countries where refugee's are fleeing en masse and help these countries improve so they don't have refugee's any longer. > 'Discrimination on nationality alone is forbidden under human rights law'  I wonder why Visas and even further screening (biometrics applications) exist then  >mean-spirited  dang guess we'll have to undo it Says the institution who have Saudi Arabia as one of the Human Rights Council Muslim travel ban = Donald is mean spirited   Throwing 'mos off the roof and decapitating your wife = welcome to the human rights council,  we welcome your ideas BRB guys gotta watch the next Saudi Arabia public execution that doesn't violate human rights law. UN better watch it or he will cancel every dollar of their budget Since when? Israeli's are banned from numerous countries but the UN has no problem with that? The Immigration Ban is only for 120 days, the Obama Administration did the exact same thing for ~~60 days~~ 6 months.   The UN is a joke.   Edit: The Obama, Iraqi immigration ban was for 6 months not 60 days, my mistake.  The last president who did the same thing got a Nobel prize go figure Sixteen countries forbid admission to anyone holding an Israeli passport, but I haven't seen the UN get upset about that.  Says the UN with Saudi Arabia on the humans right council that does that to Israel TOP KEK  Discriminating on nationality is a first principle of a sovereign border. And yet it's apparently okay for 16 Arab countries to ban Israeli's.  We need to stop seeing religion as a protected group. You shouldn't be able to say ""faith"" and ""tradition"" and be beyond ridicule. Muslims aren't a race, it's a philosophy. And there are hundreds of millions of people following it with extremist views. If any other group was so large and we so anti progress. There would be global teamwork to deal with the problem. But add an ancient holy book written by a child rapist. And you get the green light to cover half your population in cloth prisons and beat them if they try to escape.  Idiotic. Most Muslim nations have travel bans against Israel. In fact, most sovereign nations have banned travel from one nation or another at any given time in history. I don't agree with Trump but to suddenly act like this is something unprecedented is absolutely stupid. What about the dozen or so Muslim countries that don't allow Jews into their country tons of other nations ban based on nationality. they have done it for decades and nobody even talks about it. but then Trump does it, and the whole world complains. Why isn't the UN talking about the countries that forbid Israelis to enter? there are several nations in the middle east where if you have a Israeli passport or even just an Israeli stamp in your passport showing you have been there, then you are banned from coming in.  Wait, what? 10+ countries ban Israelis alone just for being from Israel, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_Israeli_citizens#Visa_requirements . So when is the UN going to address that? Ha this laughable given to UN's blind eye to the violations in Asia and middle east. But yeah if they want to try and tell us Americans how to run our nation that's fine. Will just tale our money, military, and political power and go home. Then will see how long the UN lasts. Has the UN been freaking out about these countries?  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_passport#Countries_that_do_not_accept_Israeli_passports Take that America!  We are gonna write you a letter, and word it *STRONGLY*!  Meanwhile how many member states ban anyone who even has an Israeli **STAMP**? let alone nationality.... Where is Freedom of Religion in Saudi Arabia?  Where is the Right to Vote in China?  The UN is ridiculous. Ok, so why aren't people upset these 6 nations will not allow jews from israel. Oh wait, no one cares about jews.  I'm confused. Didn't Obama do this to Iran? ""Human Right Law""? The US Constitution is the law of the land in the USA, not the UN Charter.  I find blowing people up whilst yelling ""god is great"" to be mean spirited.  But then I am just a racists, sexist, straight, white, cis-gendered male who needs to ""shut up"" Meanwhile the president of the UN Human Rights council is Saudi Arabia...  Lol these people are so insanely hyperbolic and disengenuous. There are country's that outright do not accept Syrian refugees because they simply don't want Muslim refugees. Does anyone criticise those countries? Do wacko leftists call out Japan for not taking refugees from pretty much ANY country, let alone 8? Honestly people it's time to grow up here.  Surprised. Usually the UN will use any opportunity to complain about the United States as an opportunity to condemn Israel.  I feel that Dave Chapelle skit goes perfectly here to be honest https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=084irEAQrLQ Hey UN, who did you appointment as leaders of human rights again? Lol. Yeah you have zero credibility. Thanks. Why is this illegal, but banning the same countries for the same reason *wasn't* illegal when Obama did it? Or was it illegal then as well, just didn't receive the same kind of attention? The banned countries we've been bombing the shit out of for the past 8-16 years? Where was this fuss when Obama did this shit for 6 months and used 27k bombs on them? They only care when it is not their team doing.  ""Discrimination on nationality alone is forbidden under human rights law""? - Yea tell that to the EU countries and the Schengen area for visa requirements. Double standards much? Federal immigration law also includes Section 1182(f), which states: Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall  deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate (emphasis added).    Sorry UN. go worry about coddling terrorists somewhere else. Try Germany or Canada. I hear they love refugees.  The UN is a big joke. With countries like Saudi Arabia on the Human Rights council, they [condemned Israel as the worst human rights abuser](http://yournewswire.com/un-declares-israel-as-having-worlds-worst-human-rights/amp/), beating out North Korea, China, and several middle eastern states, where girls younger than 14 are court ordered to be married off to men much older and where they [throw homosexuals off of buildings](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/bc4cf13c2b41454b820d7297f50bbf08/islamic-state-group-targets-gays-brutal-public-killings). Why would anyone even listen to what they have to say anymore? It's a good thing the UN has no authority in the US. The UN tries to do something... fails again. Nice try, UN. ""Discrimination based on nationality is against human rights laws""  Wow. It's almost like countries have borders and are separate from each other. It's like they get to decide who gets to come in regardless of what the UN thinks.   What about the Middle Eastern counties that even ban people who have even VISTED Israel? Where's the UN declaration on that? This is a joke  1.  The vetting process needs to be reviewed.   2.  The ""ban"" is temporary.  It's 3 months.      3.  Those who received visas via the vetting process that needs reviewing may not have been vetted properly -- due to the faulty process that needs review.  Therefore, they can't just be let in.   4.  I remember exactly 0 protests when Obama ""paused"" allowing visas for Iranians for 6 months in 2011 -- twice as long as the horrible, discriminatory ""ban"" that is being protested now. Jokes on them - Trump is discriminating on nationality *and* religion. Meanwhile UN hasn't said shit about the fact that middle east countries have been doing the same thing regarding refugees (and far worse REAL human rights violations) for years now.    Thats absolutely ridiculous. The UN is a joke. Has the UN also denounced the 16 countries that refuse entry to Israeli passport holders?  #[Its completely legal.](https://i.imgur.com/L8vNYWp.jpg) Since some of it's human rights council members have the same exact bans on countries they don't like, the UN has absolutely no right or legitimacy on this issue. > 'Discrimination on nationality alone is forbidden under human rights law'  There are 16 countries that do not admit people with Israeli Passports:  Algeria, Bangladesh, Brunei, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, United Arab Emirates and Yemen.  In addition, Iran,[31] Kuwait,[32] Lebanon,[33] Libya,[34] Saudi Arabia,[35] Sudan,[36] Syria[37] and Yemen[38] do not allow entry to people with evidence of travel to Israel,   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_passport#Countries_that_do_not_accept_Israeli_passports  Tell these countries that 'Discrimination on nationality alone is forbidden under human rights law' and and see if they give two shits. Can someone please explain why foreigners are telling us how to handle our own shit? Bullshit... Coming to America is a privilege, not a right. There is no obligation for us to let people in. Just like wally world... American is closed. There is a whole world for you to visit. Get to it.  So, Independent doesn't know how the UN works? It they want to denounce something they should issue a resolution. Literally fake news source that should be banned from this subreddit together with the OP The UN is a joke. And where is the UN screaming about all of the Islamic nations that ban people with Israeli passports? Or how China bullies nations to not recognize Taiwan?    Man, fuck these idiots. Wondering if the UN threw a tantrum when Obama banned Iraqis in 2011? Didn't think so. Presidential prerogative. Funny how these guys call out Trump yet they allow Saudi Arabia to crucify people on the streets. UN is a bunch of hypocritical cunts. So does this mean that Arab and Muslim countries forbidding Israeli citizens from entering Arab and Muslim countries is also illegal under human rights law?  We should withdraw from the UN and tell them to be the world's police on their own. Half our problems come from our involvement with them.  Tell that to the Iranians banning Israelis.  Or any of the other Muslim countries that do the same.  Fuck these hypocrites. Where was the UN when Obama banned travel from Iran to the US for a period of 6 months?  The U.S. President putting U.S. interests over UN interests?!  Did they do the same thing when Obama did it? Where was the outrage when Obama banned Iraqis from coming to the US for 6 months in 2011? Just throwing this out there - Obama banned travel from several countries in 2011 and nobody even made a peep. This whole thing is being blown out of proportion to stir anti-Trump sentiment.  For god's sake its just a stay on visas. Everybody needs to chill, its only going to last 90 days anyways. Bye bye UN, you are an autocratic organization that has your heads up your asses. UN must really want to move out of New York. I'm sure the US taxpayers will benefit bigly from the sale of their building.  There goes another couple billion US dollars from their budget.. Someone needs to tell all those Middle Eastern Countries they're being super duper mean from blocking Israelis from traveling there.  Meanwhile, in North Korea. . . .  Meanwhile, in Cuba. . . .  Meanwhile, in China. . . . It's okay if Obama does it to Iraq tho. That's not mean spirited. Mean president for a mean country in a mean world.  Grow up people. Is this the same UN that Trump wants to defund? How dare a President keep their word and follow through on what they said they had in plan before getting elected! Bring back the ones that tell you something you want to hear and do (or don't do) something different. Good journalism would explain what law or laws are being cited, or at the very least give a link to Prince Zeid's original statement so we could suss it ourselves. But this is the Indy. I didn't know immigration was an international human right?  I've said it many times before, and I'll say it again, fuck the UN Several countries are doing this but oh no! Trump is doing it? Better make a big deal out of it and drop some NSDAP references. The UN has no power here, their Satanic New World Order lineage created and started this War on Terror, now we are going to finish it. Tell that to the countries that slaughter people and rape their women  Obama did it. Bush did it. Politics are fucking stupid. Good thing we don't live in the United Nations of America...  Ya, fuck globalism. Ban away. Build the wall. America first. Illegal to ""discriminate"" based on nationality?  that is pretty much every country's immigration policy and every tariff ever signed.    Defund the UN! Maybe if they would denounce UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and all the other arab states right next door for not taking ANY we would not need this discussion.  But fuck us, right?   Lol a travel ban is not against human rights...  It seems Muslim countries which ban Jews from entering did not get this human rights memo. Too bad It's okay, he'll just leave the UN. Actually its nationality and religion so :P So is the UN going to call out most religions for being against human rights? Isn't the UN more of a guideline only kind of organization? Also shouldn't national security be a priority for US politicians right now? I know nobody wants to be the dick to keep innocents out but ""it only takes one bad apple to ruin the bunch"". So I guess the ban by 16 Muslims nations including all the ones featured on trumps list of Israelis is also a breach? And they will condem these nations for their gross breach of Hunan rights?  Oh the UN?  For a second I thought it was someone  that actually mattered I KNEW it would all come down to ""being mean""! I KNEW IT!! I'm tired of everyone expecting America to be deferential and accommodating to everyone who wants to come here when other countries also restrict travel from certain countries.  If you don't like our laws or how they change then don't come here. So,it is bad because Trump did it right? Because this happens everywhere and for some reason Trump is more offensive. Hum... This is weird I think falls under the ""it is our country and we can exclude who we want"" clause.  It sounds like from both sides it isn't permanent, sucks it happened so quickly (stranding people) and is to allow time for a better vetting process.  Time will tell.  Meanwhile how about that wall ;) Thanks for the input UN, we'll take it under advisement.  ""You big meanie!"" is not a valid political argument, goddamnit. I believe all seven of those countries, as well as a number of others, ban travel to those countries by those holding an Israeli passport. Where can i read the document he signed? i  cant find it anywhere? Thanks No country MUST allow anyone into their country.  I bet China and Congo were the first to denounce it......   Did the UN have the same to say when Obama did it in 2011? It was fine when Obama did it though right? Oh yeah wasn't it also cool when he killed civilians in Syria with drone strikes? I love how you people only care about these people when it fits your political agenda Just like when Obama did the exact same thing in 2011?  Where was the UN then? I don't hear anyone at the US complaining about the countries that will not allow Israelis nor anyone with an Israeli stamp in their passport in. Take a look at who's on the human rights committee at the U. N. and tell me the U. N. Is serious about enforcing human rights law.  Why isn't the UN complaining about Israeli citizens being banned from Muslim countries then? So hypocritical it is disgusting.  So when Obama did it in 2011 for 6 months it's ok?  So when most middle eastern countries ban Israeli's it's ok?  Allowing people into your country isn't a right. It's a privilege. Treating it like it's a human right is walking over a nations sovereignty and borders. Without proper control bad people get in and tragedy occurs.  3 months is drop in the bucket compared to what has happened before and what's happening elsewhere. ""mean spirited"" come the fuck on how old are we?  Why do they all HAVE to come HERE?? I just don't get it. Our Constitution explicitly allows for the President to restrict immigration on any class of people. We're not a one world government, yet, thank God. [removed] [removed] It's different. I am syrian, and under obama's admin we had almost   a blanket ban on Syrians. (Have not seen my mother in 11 years because of this).       But you could go the the embassy and a consular would determine whether you are eligible or not. To get an interview you had to pay a non-refundable ~~~$300~~ $160 and the most prominent condition was to show the consular that you have strong ties to your country of origin and prove that you are not going to overstay. Now for syrians that was almost impossible to prove. I know very few syrian who were able to get visitor visas to the US but they had permanent residency in other countries. Finally, Trump could have done the same, issue a blanket ban on issuing visas without making it an official policy of the United States. he could just direct his state dept to not issue visas (like obama did). What trump did instead is send a message. You interpret the message however you want.             Edit: correct visa fee  There are sixteen member nations of the UN that have permanent bans on Israeli passport holders entering the country. Trump's ban is a short-term expansion of limitations put in place by Obama.  I mean, I'm not thrilled about the ban either, but it is being reported on in an entirely disingenuous way. Like the countries on Trump's list, who ban all Israelis and even people who happened to visit Israel and have an Israeli stamp on their passport.  You won't hear a UN condemnation for that though... That's the main reason my wife became American. It was easier traveling with an American passport.   Shouldn't countries have the right to decide  who they let it? If they don't, then why aren't people mad at all the other countries who have strict rules about who comes in? Yes, even at risk countries mail is usually screened as well, due to more illegal importing.  Not only that, but I didn't see the UN commenting on is drone strikes killing civilians under the Obama administration? Correct me if I'm wrong but killing innocents is worse than keeping them from our country. [I wonder if anyone is going to mention this to the Media](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_passport#Countries_that_do_not_accept_Israeli_passports) What? Name a single country that doesn't have different entry requirements for different nationalities....  So? Non-citizens have no inherent right to enter whatever country they want. Literally every country ""discriminates"" against foreigners. It's called having an immigration policy. This isn't the first time, where was the UN when there was a ban several years ago?  Shit like this is why people get redpilled. The countries banned by Trump do not allow anyone with an Israeli passport to enter. They actively discriminate based on nationality, and yet you will never hear anything about it from the UN. This has been going on for decades now, and no one seems to care or do anything about it.  That's why I support the ban. Maybe if they themselves get banned as a result, they'll realize that their policies are wrong and they'll change them. Wasn't fully banned to be fair, if they made it to dry land they got citizenship. It was a sick game but they had a chance at least.  Edit 1: I know Obama ended it  Edit 2: I know Obama ended it  Edit 3: I know Obama ended it  Edit 4: Yes, I'm sure I know he ended it  Edit 5: May...maybe I'm not sure, I'm not sure I know who I am anymore. The UN complained about that *all the time* for *decades* Literally all 7 of the countries included in the temporary travel ban have banned those with Israeli passports from entering their country since the 1950's. I haven't heard anything from the UN as regards to that. Exactly. The U.S. selectively chooses to ignore or celebrate the statutes of the U.N. as it suits them.  The problem with the U.N is that it's a dog with no teeth, all they produce is 'suggestions' that get ignored. I'm working in Qatar, this country (along with almost every other middle eastern one) bans visas on nationality without warning just because it can and has done for decades.   Shame the UN haven't made a single comment about that.  Something like 6/7 of the countries on the list completely ban the visitation of anyone holding an Israeli passport. > 'Discrimination on nationality alone is forbidden under human rights law'  Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia bans citizens from UN member state Israel from entry to their country and they were given a prominent seat on the UN Human Rights Council.   Na dawg, before Trump all citizens of the world traveled freely.  Pretty sure some of those countries don't even recognise Israel as a sovereign state. So I guess they can't let people from ""nowhere"" in....that ought to be the next executive order, then at least he'd have a point of argument. 43 Muslims countries do not fall under Trump's ban. Narrative shattered. [removed] They also had Ida Amin give a speech denouncing Israel, then held a banquet in  his honor, where he preceded to devour the Japanese ambassador. Guess which part of that I'm making up.  Iirc head of human rights council is a rotating position that everyone gets at some point Well on a good day the UN is toothless. When it comes to chastising any member of the security Council it's pointless. I don't see the point of it anymore. Its ancillary organizations, like WHO, do a lot more than the core.  That's the problem with international law and institutions in general, it's hard to enforce. It's usually up to the members of the agreement to act rationally because they benefit from it.  [relevant chappeles show skit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=084irEAQrLQ) This whole ""discrimination based on nationality is forbidden"" means the UN thinks every single visa requirement ever is illegal. Bingo. She just shrunk the perceived power of the UN by an order of magnitude.  yeah, that'll happen Visas do not discriminate on nationality specifically though. They serve to prove that a given individual has met the requirements to stay in another country under a specific premise (work, leisure, etc.) Pretty sure the key word in that sentence is ""alone"".  Literally the ""says mean things"" meme.  The divide between memes and reality shrinks every day. It is a very strongly worded letter indeed. literally the meanest thing i've ever seen, seriously guys, stop Trump is so MEAN!!!!!11 the UN is condemning a lot of nations a lot of times,   rarely does it criticizes the US -  both because it's not a 3rd world dictatorship     and because the 7 largest powers (who's interests the UN is specifically built to protect) enjoy an elevated, almost untouchable status in the UN.   That's exactly why this is so alarming.  Its a travel ban based on nationality, not religion. For example I have a few friends Christian friends from Iraq and they would have been banned. The council thing rotates among members over time.  Nobody specifically chose Saudi Arabia for that role.  Also, if you're going to talk about human rights abuses, let's talk about CIA black sites and torture of innocent civilians by the USA.  We're not exactly a paragon of morality lately either. I'm sorry, is decapitating your wife legal in Saudi Arabia? Because the UN never denounces Saudi Arabia. It's not an immigration ban. It's a temporary stay on visas That's the crux of this, the wrong person is doing it. If Hillary had done it, or when Obama did do it, there was no problem with it.  well it makes sense, it's the *human* rights council, and according to the head of the council, the Jews in Israel don't count as people, so it makes sense that banning them is not a human rights violation. it's the same reason honor killings are cool, because you'd have to consider a woman human for it to be a human rights violation. doesn't the UN have a great human rights council? Saudi Arabia wasn't included in Trump's ban... Right now the news media is sitting back, enjoying their coffee, and watching the fires they started ignite throughout the country.    This is why I'm fucking pissed off every time I come on the internet since Trump was elected. This hate-Trump train is packed full of people and the hypocrisy is running rampant with them. No one but israel and the US. If we drop our vigilance we'll wind up repeating history.  Perhaps we shouldn't import a mass of people who hate Jews.  > Ok, so why aren't people upset these 6 nations will not allow jews from israel.  People are.. This is something that has always baffled me. Europe and America have been criticizing each other for the handling of refugees meanwhile the 2nd and 3rd largest economies of the world (China and Japan) don't feel obligated to do anything. Maybe they feel they aren't responsible.  Japan let in a few and 2 raped a woman within like a week. > I hear they love refugees.  I heard the refugees ""love"" them. Top of reddit. So they succeeded in what they do best: informing the public of injustice. I wish we instead of hate for the UN we could support them when they're right. Especially right now. What do you actually expect them to do?  Would you support if the UN invaded America and forced airports to allow refugees into the country?  If the UN did anything *more* than a letter of condemnation, people would go ballistic that the UN was trying to seize power or something.  That's not its mission. The Independent has been bashed time and time again of spreading lies, propaganda, sensationalized nonsense, etc. I don't understand the sudden boom of Independent articles coming in. All they know is their hate of Trump. It has blinded them to all reason and logic Pfft. Muslim Countries can't violate human rights.  Especially against Israel.  It's just not physically possible. As an Israeli... obviously. Will anyone say this or care or make a UN resolution? No. Almost 25% of sovereign states are Muslim majority and the OIC runs the UN.  Name a single problem we have that is caused by the UN? Obama instituted a 6-month interview process. Like, totally different from a ban. Not a ban at all, no sirreee! I believe you have been duped my good man. Obama created an interview process for the countries but never a ban. Many of our green card holders and other such people who are already citizens are being affected by this ban which the interview process never would have. Both sides of the media are blowing your eardrums out but it's good to google this stuff every now and then to do a little research.  Edit: > citizens   This should read ""permanent resident"" which is what green card holder is.  More on the topic below by a person of proper semantics. But... he hurt their feelings! That's like worse than running people over with a truck! [removed] They might be harsher (or not) on Syrian but I heard the same thing for other countries. Especially if you are young, single female with no income, no job, no saving, no family in the original country. >To get an interview you had to pay a non-refundable ~$300 and the most prominent condition was to show the consular that you have strong ties to your country of origin and prove that you are not going to overstay.    this is true for nearly every country though, that is not unique to Syrians.  Am Russian, had to go through the same process to get my visitor visa. If you have numerous visits to EU countries in your passport and a decent job you are almost guaranteed to get approval. Why didn't you just meet your mother somewhere else instead of the US or Syria?  sounds standard visa application to literally everywhere for literally everyone  my fees were well above 5000USD   cry me a river and welcome to the club pal   no handouts and freebees here    As for the expense and impossible to prove standards, the US treats Citizens of a lot of other countries similarly even some of the countries we like. Not to mention the Consulate staff are total assholes in many cases. So he put in writing what was already essentially a policy? As far as I remember, the Israeli passports are banned, but dual nationals using a non Israeli passport isn't banned. Here even dual nationals are restricted. I may be a bit off as it been a little while since I last looked into it, but certain countries don't and haven't ever recognised Israel as a legitimate country and that's why they don't allow Israeli passports get out of here with your inconvenient, narrative-shattering facts! >but I didn't see the UN commenting on is drone strikes killing civilians under the Obama administration  http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=46831  Also:  https://www.google.ca/#q=un+condemns+us+drone+strikes  Why on earth do people think they have a right to just enter any country they want? A government is under no obligation to let you in their borders, just as I'm under no obligation to let you in my home (yes Reddit I'm aware the analogy will only carry so far)   Edit because there seems to be a misconception -    Do not take this as I endorse the ban. Of course it's stupid. The Boston Bombers and the 9/11 Hijackers all would have gotten pass this ban,  if nothing else were to hint at the absurdity. But that doesn't mean the president *can't* do it. He definitely can, it's rightfully within his power to do so. Like it was within Obama's power to drop 26,000 bombs last year.  They did many many many times. blame your media for not reporting it or yourself for not being informed.  I know it's unpopular to say, but there has *clearly* been a globalist agenda in the works and they (globalists: NATO, leftists, media) are fighting HARD against Trump.   Lmao this is your go to argument for everything isn't it? that's Nobel Peace Prize winner Obama to you^ This is an important point. If this ban is bad, why is it then acceptable for these countries to prevent Israeli tourists from visiting? Either the UN applies the unifying standard for everyone, or it should let individual nations decide how their immigration policy looks like. You can't have it both ways.   As for people complaining that these are backward shitholes and they shouldn't be emulated, then why in the world is it wrong to ban people from these failed states?    I understand the whole /r/politics vs. /r/The_Donald thing we got going on recently is going to destroy any chance of a dialogue, but I really don't think it's as simple as a lot of people are making this out to be.      **Edit:** A quick look at this thread tells me that this point is probably going to be the focus of this debate, so I'm going to elaborate a bit further. Let's assume that these countries ban Israelis because they consider them as members of an enemy state. Then the US also has the right to enforce this ban. Most of the countries on Trump's ban list are technically considered as hostile states in the War against Terror from the perspective of the United States. The US has bombed nearly all of them, and has made it quite clear since Obama's time that they need to be better at weeding out the extremists. As for Iran, the US has made it very clear for decades now that it vehemently opposes Iranian actions in the Middle East (you can disagree on whether this should be the case or not, but the reality is that it is).    If the argument is that all Israelis are being banned because of the hostility of a few Zionists, then again this ban has validity, because the US is also enacting a wide range ban to prevent the entry of a small number of people.    No matter how you look at this, the double standard makes it very hard to accept the international condemnation we're seeing right now at face value. Trump should make a statement saying he'll lift the ban on the 7 Muslim countries on the condition that those Muslim countries lift the ban on Israel. Those Muslim countries most likely won't while we will, but at the very least it will show the hypocrisy of those Muslim countries to the world.      Non-Mobile link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_passport#Countries_that_do_not_accept_Israeli_passports *** ^HelperBot ^v1.1 ^/r/HelperBot_ ^I ^am ^a ^bot. ^Please ^message ^/u/swim1929 ^with ^any ^feedback ^and/or ^hate. ^Counter: ^25161 And those countries have close to zero respect in the world, not something the US should seek to emulate.  Ah yes. Why shouldn't the bastion of freedom and democracy have the same standards as a 3rd world authoritarian shithole. Good point you bring up. **""Others do bad things, so it's ok for us to do bad things"" is very flawed logic** I understand your point - when I went to Israel they didn't even put a permanent stamp on my passport bc many countries won't let you travel there if you even just been to Israel. Those countries have a lot to hate about them, which is why I want my country to be nothing like them, including when it comes to immigration. USA has historically been a more welcoming country than just about everywhere else, and IMO that's something to be proud of. And yet Saudi Arabia and Pakistan aren't on the list, even though they're sponsors of terrorism and don't allow anyone with Israeli passports in their country. Weird. What the fuck does that have to do with the US's policy?  We should strive to be more like those countries by doing the same thing? That seems like an odd argument to make... ""Base!"" Wet foot, dry foot was implemented in the 90s.  I think the much better example is the fact that the countries banned by Trump do not allow anyone with an Israeli passport (or sometimes even an Israeli stamp in their foreign passport) to enter. They actively discriminate based on nationality, and yet you will **never** hear anything about it from the UN.  This has been going on for decades and they never issued a single condemnation of that policy. Being from Miami, this was such a cancer to our city. I'm so glad Obama repealed that before he left.  Edit: The reason I say this is because the older generation of Cubans often look for hand-outs and free money through welfare, unemployment, and tax evasion. They pack a family of 10 into Section 8 housing, and very few of those 10 work. I'm not saying all Cubans are like this. Hell, I have plenty of Cuban friends and coworkers who aren't this way. But there are too many people in Miami as it is, and it was only getting worse as more immigrants came to this city. The traffic is ridiculous and a lot of them are assholes on top of that.  That is until Obama removed that dry land refuge status through executive action in order to play nice with Cuba's leaders.  Also most Cuban immigrants after the 1960s came to the US for economic reasons. Nothing remotely on the scale of what's going on in Syria.  You know, Obama ended it The UN has officially condemned US's Cuban position literally every single year since 1991. ""If I didn't hear it then it didn't happen"" And even then it wasn't a hard ban. One of my parents came into the US from Cuba legally. It took 11 years of process but it happened. This was in the late 70s. That's because you don't read the human rights reports the UN puts out. They have definitely condemned those bans as well.  > The problem with the U.N is that it's a dog with no teeth, all they produce is 'suggestions' that get ignored.  Sure, but no one would accept the UN if it had teeth. Almost no one wants a global government, so basically naming and shaming is as good as the global community does. It's a place where PR battles can happen and not shed any blood. They almost got the Avengers though, according to the Captain America documentary I watched starring Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. Well it *has* teeth, but they just so happen to be the US. The US is the teeth And if it DID try to enforce sanctions on the US or something, the US has veto power. Not that sanctions would ever make it through regardless, because there are several other countries who have veto power who wouldn't let it through, and the world economy depends so substantially on the US economy.  The problem is that the US is largely considered the teeth of the UN, as in USA: World Police. Saudi Arabia being allowed to sit on that council pretty much invalidates what it has to say.  Except the Jews. Screw those Jews. /s So america can just pretend those 7 countries don't exist and the ban is legit?   It's more than that however, many have 'all countries accepted besides Israel' on the *first page of their passport*.  [Photo of an example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Pakistani_passport_not_valid_for_Israel.jpg)  [Zoomed out photo](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-44027d1fac9fcaea0e26aba4550f885b-c?convert_to_webp=true)  This is not internal US figure speaking, but a UN figure. He is judging one member while ignoring many others. In the UN all countries are supposed to be treated equally. Why would they need a banquet if he was going to eat an ambassador?  The issue is these people aren't being allowed any form of legal process it's just a blanket ban. There's a travel ban on Israeli passports across the middle East - would you argue that *that's* discrimination? Also, it's wrong to discriminate against a nationality because US immigration law says so.  Edit: a lot of you seem to be missing the point of this comment. The above commenter said that banning specific countries isn't discrimination. I offered a counter example to state that it was.  Travel bans that target specific countries are discrimination. That is the point I was trying to make. Sorry if I made it poorly. That's the problem with pretending that international law works in any way like normal, national law.  ""National"" law is an extension of state authority. International law is an extension of diplomacy. At first is totally based on nationality, (In the case of Canada if I was an EU citizen I would only need my passport to enter but as a Honduran I need my passport and a valid visa, if I were Haitian I would need both documents plus a [biometrics data application](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/biometrics.asp) which is sent to the Canadian police)  My economic status, education, relationships and travel is only considered after this requirement     With exception of diplomatic government staff, visas apply to every citizen of any country deemed to require visa. At least in the case of Canada Denying memes from the beginning was just denying the intrinsic and sarcastic nature of modern, western society  Trump is finished now.  Dankest Timeline I was reading foreign news in Europe. Even in another language they sound exactly like American news. Same points even similar analogies and metaphors between different sources. They are all getting their information from the same place.  No one is afraid of the UN, they are like the teachers that always gives verbal warnings and never give a detention.  > It's a temporary stay on visas  No, it's a temporary ban on immigration, not a ""stay on visas"".  Valid visa holders are not being allowed to enter the US--i.e. banned from entry.   I do not agree with the UN's stance that we cannot have our own rules about our borders...  However the biggest problem with this is the fact that they blanketly banned even green card holders (I know that was repealed,but really they couldn't figure that out beforehand), and the lack of communication with other agencies before the ban was put into place. That's not what Obama did.   He just changed the vetting process. Never banned anyone.  [Because Trump used Obama's list of terror risk countries.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/01/29/politics/how-the-trump-administration-chose-the-7-countries/index.html) Moreover, Saudi Arabia was on a list of rotating heads for the council. not specifically appointed. The reason there are countries in that council that have bad track records on human rights is so they can work with other countries and be influenced that way into changing their track record. Absolutely.  The media pretends to care about the country but all they do is fan the flames for their own benefit to the detriment of the country.  Throughout the election cycle they complained that Trumps promises for things like repealing the ACA and building the wall were dangerous.  Then after Trump is elected he hinted that he might walk back some of those promises but instead of boosting his ego and telling him that he is making the right choice in walking those back (because why not, he already won), the media started pushing out articles discussing how Trump completely duped his supporters and they were fools for believing him.  The guy literally watches all the major news networks every night. I have no doubt that part of the reason why he is trying to force through these promises so suddenly is because the media was trying to actively turn his supporters against him by claiming they were conned.   If they actually cared, they would promote the good while denouncing the bad like objective media outlets should be doing instead of looking for ways to turn both the good and bad into a future political win.   they don't have time for bullshit > citizens   This should read ""permanent resident"" which is what green card holder is.  Green card holders are protected by all USA laws, they can't vote or hold office.  This means they are not allowed to be detained without probable cause just like a USA citizen cannot.   Any charges against them must follow due process, they must be arrested, charged, and tried.  You cannot just throw them out of the country like you can with Visas most of the time.  https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/after-green-card-granted/rights-and-responsibilities-permanent-resident/rights-and-responsibilities-green-card-holder-permanent-resident  [removed] [removed] [removed] There has been a Civ V mod for Trump's America for a long time, since before the elections [removed] In some EU countries, the non-refundable fee is ~1000 Euros. Speaking from personal experience.   Not to be mean, just saying it's life, and yes it's shitty. Yup. My ex had to go through this a few years ago, she lives in Canada but still has to travel with her Ukrainian passport until she has citizenship. Something like $180 and a couple hours wasted going to the consulate in Montreal for an interview, and she was rejected. Just for a visa to go visit a friend together. Not ""strong enough"" ties to return home to Canada. They didn't care that we had return tickets and I would be accompanying her. Apparently around 25% of visitor visas for Ukrainian citizens are refused. This article cites it as a ban on all ""Israeli passport holders.""  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_passport  And:  >In addition, Iran, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen do not allow entry to people with evidence of travel to Israel, or whose passports have either a used or an unused Israeli visa.  In that sense, it is more extreme than the Trump ban.  I'm not understanding how the fact that they don't recognize Israel's legitimacy excuses the behavior from similar reasoning as applied by the UN.  The UN obviously DOES recognize Israel, and their whole reason for existence is as an organization to mediate and promote co-operation between member states.  You could say that they are enemy states of one another (meaning Israel and the others), but in that case, doesn't it at least begin to justify Trump's reasoning to expand immigration limits on states deemed by the Obama admin to be security risks to the US? Again, we are talking about a 3 to 4 month term with a specified project to be carried out in that interim: the design of a more exhaustive vetting process.  Heck, even the refugee ""ban"" is ultimately a cap of 50,000, which is slightly more than the average year for GWB. and somewhat less than Obama.  This is really being misrepresented.  http://www.nationalreview.com/article/444370/donald-trump-refugee-executive-order-no-muslim-ban-separating-fact-hysteria I agree, I'm all for critiquing the executive branch and the government as a whole, but will this trend continue with the next Democrat president? >I understand the whole /r/politics vs. /r/The_Donald thing we got going on recently is going to destroy any chance of a dialogue  I wish we had more neutral areas where dialogue from both sides were welcome, as long as they were geared towards discussion. /r/neutralpolitics is a decent one as far as I can tell.  For now, I just read through threads filtering top comments first and then again filtering for controversial. Not a perfect fix, though. Holy cow that is one reasonable comment.  I believe it has to do with recognizing them as a legitimate country. They see it as occupied Palestine rather than isreal. Because Trump banned green card holders. The ban on refugees from those counties has been there for awhile but Trump's administration took it to legal residents and students that are part of the US community. Such a childish mentality. BUT MOM, THEY CAN DO IT - WE ALSO WANT TO.  Americans, show the world that you aren't all narrowminded pricks. You are a fucking developed country, act like it. Banning refugees? Fucking shame on you.  Doesn't mean I agree with the other countries banning Israeli tourists - UN should definately look into that too. It is a big deal when the United States is one of the five permanent members of the security council. the US officially conceived the first notion of the United Nations in 1941 (after the league of nations failed) with the Declaration of United Nations which led to the conference of international organization in San Francisco in 1945 to create the charter for the UN. The US is a major part of the UN, we took part in creating what the UN stands for, that is why we should definitely not be the ones breaking those laws. We should be the equivalent of the upon the hill in terms of countries. I'll let you reason out why its extremely important for the US to uphold the UN and its regulations.       That... would produce some excellent popcorn if nothing else. Let's do it.  Or agree to decriminalize gay sex. It baffles me that liberals are fighting for this TBH I had no travel plans to go to Iran anytime soon. Maybe those countries might consider lifting the ban if Israel got out of Palestine and went back to the defined borders... It's crazy how people in these comments are like yea welll How come for example Sudan can do it! It's fucken Sudan we have much higher standards we and should know better.  My objection to this is not the EO itself, which I don't agree with, it's more about the UNs response  If the UN isn't going to hold the arab countries accountable too, they can fuck right off 1)Chinese Exclusion Act.  2)Jewish Refugees During WWII were sent away.  3)Anarchist Exclusion Act.  4)Iranian Bans.  5)Communist bans.  6)Ban on the Japanese During WWII (Put citizens of US in camps).  7)Banned Known HIV carriers.  8)Banned the Irish during their potato famine.  I mean, this is not even remotely new, Barack Obama did it to Iraq, Carter did it to Iran in the 80's.   In addition this is not a permanent ban, its  a 90 day suspension until more thorough background search criteria can be created.  Ask Obama about that. It was his list. It is not illegal or immoral to restrict immigration by country of origin, it's just something that most people (myself included) don't want or like. There's not a country on earth that has a blanked immigration policy that's applied equally to all people regardless of their nationality. That means the outrage is fake and one sided. No takesies backsies! My uncle worked for a defence contractor. He was able to get two passports for this issue - one for islamic countries and one for israel.  Wait, aren't we supposed to NOT act like those countries?   ""Im not so sure about this travel ban Donald.""  ""Don't worry islamofascist regimes do it all the time!""  ""Ohh, ok I guess its cool then..."" South Florida's economic growth from a hick town was largely driven by Cuban immigrants.  Cubans are arguably the most successful immigrant diaspora in American history. They have risen to a place of economic, cultural, and political prominence at a speed hitherto unheard of in immigrant populations. They have been here less than a handful of generations and had two serious contenders for president in the last election. Sorry your traffic is bad.  ... And for the right reasons? Cubans can still obtain asylum in the US if they want to, they just cant come to the US for economic reasons as easily anymore. Thats what 99% of nations do. Yes and No. Yes a lot of the Cuban immigrants fled to the USA to escape Communism (a economic political ideology) but a lot of them also fled to escape firing squads, destruction because of battles, political imprisonment and forced enlistment in the Cuban army. Similar to whats going on in Syria  Source: I'm Cuban American. It's also a major factor in preventing nuclear war.  They got three Avengers in the end, but one of them has a spinal injury, one's a loose cannon, and the last one may or may not be ""alive"" by our current definition. *AMERICA! FUCK YEAH!*  Oh God They used to get free train rides around Europe back in the 30s and 40s but the US helped take that away too. Sounds like the Chinese method. Yes, that might be a way to get out of the legal mess.   We don't recognize that Taiwan exists for example. That photo is of literally the opposite of what you claim, it's forbidding the user from visiting Israel.  He didn't share. Worse, initially people with valid green cards were being turned away.  The green card grants them the right of entry.   it is a 90 day ban while the US comes up with new (stricter?) legal processes for people from those countries to follow in order to get into the US Or that anyone who isn't a Muslim isn't allowed in Mecca. Oh wait, that's literally straight up discriminating on religion. Lol, the UN is so biased it's ridiculous. Fine, be mad at the US for this, but at least be consistent with your outrage. Well, yes it is! Yesssss, YESS! Let's be more like the Middle East guys, they seem to have their shit figured out > deemed to require visa  There you have it. the discrimination.  Truly we live in the dankest timeline. How will he ever recover?  The one thing Hillary needed to do to win is to call trump a meanie face instead of an idiot Trump better call the furniture removal people and move out of the White House. They did ""figure that out"" beforehand, but Bannon explicitly told them to include green card holders in the ban anyway.   Bannon is the guy running the show. Knowing this, why does anyone believe this ban is anything but a ploy on his part? It has nothing to do with keeping America safe and is expressly aimed at endangering us. He wants increased ISIS recruiting and he wants a terror attack on US soil; those are the only two things that can hope to halt Trump's popularity decline and stave off the GOP Congress growing a spine and removing Bannon and/or Trump. He needs terror and fear to stay in power. And that list went nowhere. Now, Trump is the one who makes the calls, not Obama. Since Obama's list went nowhere, Trump is the one wielding the responsibility.  [removed] [removed] That is wishful thinking [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] It looks like you survived whatever firestorm happened here. What happened in this wasteland of comments? There's a *US* law against discriminating based on national origin for the purposes of immigration.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965#Provisions Personally, I'm far less engaged in /r/worldnews and /r/news than before because of the sudden influx of all things Trump. I understand that it's no longer ""US internal news"" because he's actually the President, but I would be lying if I said I am not looking forward to things dying down a bit. Also, there's been a obvious leftward shift lately. It is really telling how used I was to the slight right-wing slant this place has had. The shift actually makes me a bit uncomfortable, but at the same time I think everyone needs a shock to their system and a willingness to understand the other side after the election we just had.    PS - for people wondering about the absolute increase in shitposts in the last 10 minutes, the article just entered into the frontpage of /r/all For a second I was shocked to see this reply and the original so high up, then I looked and saw this was not r/politics.  /r/politics should be the neutral area.. /r/t_D is exactly what it says it is and was never supposed to be un-biased  I agree. I've had accounts banned without explanation from subs and users regularly will cite me being a poster in /r/The_Donald to invalidate anything I post whatsoever. For the last two months it's been constant threats, flagging to admins and things verging on doxxing from left wing posters.  I only started reading The_Donald after the Nice attack (I think) when a moderator in worldnews started deleting posts that disagreed with their own point of view. From there TD has been a way to see things from other sources and get a balanced overall view because the media is very biased in one way or another.   While TD's posters are not saints, the left genuinely scares me at the moment with the lack of common sense involved and the extremism I see from people I actually know, let alone Reddit.   I mean, when someone says that anyone who posts anything right wing online should be catalogued and then at a later date rounded up and shot it's idiotic. When they genuinely can't see the comparison between their own comment and the actions of the Nazis it's terrifying.   I broadly agree with Trump's ban but the way he's handled it is absurdly bad and I can't personally defend it. The way people have reacted to it without interest in facts and just going on any tidbit of information they have is terrifying. Rare sight to see on here these days. Bask in all its glory! > Holy cow  No, you are thinking of India.  It's not just that.   >In addition, Iran, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen do not allow entry to people with evidence of travel to Israel, or whose passports have either a used or an unused Israeli visa. As a consequence, many countries will allow for a second passport to be issued to citizens wishing to circumvent this restriction although the Israeli immigration services themselves have now mostly ceased to issue entry or exit stamps to foreign nationals.    I looked at for a map Interestingly, one real reason to not let Syrian's into any country is because the entire passport and documentation system has been totally corrupted from the inside out.  When you lose control of a region and the apparatus for issuing legitimate passports and documents is compromised, the only thing to do is to invalidate all of the documents and start again.  Anyone travelling on  Syrian password should be presumed to have fake documents.  Europe knows this and takes that assumption.  You can't trust the documents because the rebels have had control of the mechanisms on and off for months at a time. They changed that last night iirc They are members of the same UN which is now complaining > Why are we taking countries like Suadia Arabia and Yeman as benchmark? These countries are obviously no role model when it comes to issues of human rights.  Saudi Arabia was recently elected to the UN human rights council.  They now have significant influence over UN policies on human rights so why are we using them as a benchmark?  Because the UN decided they were worthy of that benchmark.   The same UN that is now decrying Trump's travel ban. You just had a good thought as an adult. As children, we were taught right and wrong, and the same went for which countries are good and bad.   The shocking news is as an adult, and very frustratingly so, we learn that it is not a black and white world. It's very grey. Very grey. Saudia Arabia is a shithole, but the US is allies with them, and we continue to be. The same goes with other countries that have problems.   I think it's important to teach children kindness grounded in reality. Rather than telling them a country is bad, it's important to make them understand that there's bad people in some countries(or something similar to that).   Teach them about culture, and the reality of it. Yes, there are many good people throughout the Middle East, but they do live in a different time from the West and that's ok, but not if it means harm to us.  Exactly this. Israel has no retaliatory bans on any people from this countries entering Israel, for a reason: because Israel isn't a totalitarian shit hole. I'm not saying Trump's Executive Order was worded/intended this way, but instead of considering it a ban on nationality but on immigration/emigration standards.      ""These x, y, z countries do not do enough in the way of background checks during the visa-issuing process, and so immigration from those countries is halted until we can get a more thorough screening process in place.""      Again, not saying Trump's EO was enacted anywhere close to this way. But a non-hateful, non-racist ban/restriction on immigration can exist IMO Imagine if this was Trump's plan all along.  Use the ban as leverage for some other negotiations.  That would be some Nixon-level psychological manipulation.  And I'm sure the majority of the citizens from the 7 banned nations weren't planning on coming to the U.S. anytime soon. This doesn't change the hypocrisy of the UN and those nations.     Wow these acts sure look great from the lens of history and modern understanding!   No one expects a country like Iran or Syria to be pinnacles of human rights. They haven't been a leading nation since WW2 with a claim to being ""land of the free.""  There are too many things to focus on in the world.  You can't be outraged over everything.   You'd probably drive yourself nuts if you literally were outraged at every human rights violation in some of these countries, at certain point you just have shrug and say ""I'm not surprised"" and pick your battles.  No one is exactly say ""yay, you guys can totally discriminate based on nationality of origin!!""  They're freaking out because a major nation is taking unprecedented steps to deny even more human rights on a sweeping scale.  This entire argument is a fucking red herring. >Whataboutism Your post is just so idiotic.  Have you ever heard the expression ""If you want to make the world a better place, start with yourself""?   I can't make the world perfect, I know that.  I don't live in Iran or Syria, and have no influence there.  I live the USA, I do have (some) influence here.  It's not fake to do what I can to better the world, and right now all I can do is try to make my own country the best it can be. No, takesies backsies! > Wait, aren't we supposed to NOT act like those countries?  Contrariwise, isn't the UN supposed to CONDEMN that behavior? Immigrants tend to do that, promoting local economies. It's almost as though their immigration was driven by some sort of desire to work towards a better life. And the cocaine trade. Can't forget about all those rich northern immigrants too I think mutually assured destruction was the biggest factor in preventing nuclear war though :) No, the concept of mutually assured destruction is way more deterring than some global police force. USA...fucking dicks as usual. I'd love to have a free train ride. God.  It's an ancient Chinese secret  Sounds like a slavsphere story 7 ways on how to make countries disappear.  But the US does accept Taiwanese passports. Currently without a need for visa application for tourism, if I remember correctly. The same cannot be said for Chinese passports, which do require visas.   It's a bizarre system at best.  By admitting that Israel exists.  And I'm pissed off at that too. But I don't expect Saudi Arabia to be an equal society. I do, however, expect the US to be.  Beyond this, it is also a matter of priorities. The US going backwards on these issues is a threat to global equality and democracy. Saudi stating stagnant? Not so much.  In any case, I don't really understand this argument, though perhaps you can enlighten me:  You're justifying these actions by pointing to a nation with horrendous human rights records and many diaoixable policies, and you are saying that because they do it it is fine for us to do it?  You don't see the issue with that argument? Why is that /s? If he really wanted to protect us why wouldn't he include the countries from which the 9/11 attackers came from? Especially since his order explicitly referenced 9/11?  What is your alternative? Bomb them into enlightenment?  Not really things are getting better maybe slowly but they are [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] Haha, I rushed production of a Bomb Shelter. Can never be too safe  Whoa, I am on mobile and just expanded to see the rest of the thread. That is just darn creepy. From what I remember, the comments were fairly innocuous. Someone made a Civ reference about Gandhi nuking something, and someone said I can't wait till we see a Trump leader for America in Civ, and here we are.   The original comment was someone saying like ""if Civ has taught me anything, it's that denunciations really don't mean anything"" This applies to an immigrant who is in the visa process, not restricting visas from certain countries. Once you are in the process the national origin doesn't matter, but getting in the process is another matter entirely.   Relevant section of US code modified by this law:  >(A) Except as specifically provided in paragraph (2) and in sections 1101(a)(27), 1151(b)(2)(A)(i), and 1153 of this title, no person shall receive any preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the persons race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence.  Later on ([1187(a)(12)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1187), the section Trump cited in his executive order:  [Under a section on restrictions]  >(A) In generalExcept as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C)  >(i) the alien has not been present, at any time on or after March 1, 2011  >(I) in Iraq or Syria;  >(II) in a country that is designated by the Secretary of State under section 4605(j) of title 50 (as continued in effect under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)), section 2780 of title 22, section 2371 of title 22, or any other provision of law, as a country, the government of which has repeatedly provided support of acts of international terrorism; or  >(III) in any other country or area of concern designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security under subparagraph (D); and  In going through the laws, I'm surprised the ban on members of the Communist Party is still on the books and how convoluted the immigration law is. You really need a lawyer to go over this rather than some guy who like reading the actual documentation.  It's not just those two anymore - fucking /r/pics is 100% politics posts today.  [removed] I'd typically consider myself left, but the left slant of many political subs is really scaring me right now, especially given what some of the ""left"" oriented people have been saying about the other side... Reddit has already been compromised in terms of unbiasedness. There are already companies out there who buy accounts and use them to promote their products and political views.   [If its already happening to /r/politics, why wouldn't it happen on news or worldnews] (https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/5agmik/cnn_drops_commentator_after_finding_she_provided/d9gj9eb/) [removed] I just don't get how the left beats the shit out of someone while screaming ""peace!"" If these people were taking the Gandhi approach then okay that's one thing. Knocking people out in an airport is another. >The shift actually makes me a bit uncomfortable, but at the same time I think everyone needs a shock to their system and a willingness to understand the other side after the election we just had.    For you and everyone reading this, please try and remember that conservatives and liberals are not enemies. We disagree, but as long as the discussion is logical and fact based its healthy.   As soon as we buy into the foxnews propaganda of making us enemies (I say fox because as far as I know, they are the only news group that uses the other viewpoint as an insult) we are actively harming ourselves and country as a whole.   If the differing view makes you uncomfortable, try and discover *why*. Because one source of that discomfort could be that the other arguments are incorrect as far as your logic and feelings go. If so, try and show the other people your logic and facts. See if you can help them grow. But the other more important possibility is that *your own* arguments are not holding muster.   If there is a remote chance that it's the latter, then *please* continue to think about things. Don't just dismiss or run away from the statements.  I would even go so far as to say that if comments or discussions don't occasionally make you feel uncomfortable for the 2nd reason, you are not in a good place and are instead in an echo chamber. Which makes you feel good, but doesn't actually help you grow as a person.   Note: this applies to *everyone* regardless of political affiliations.   /r/NeutralPolitics gets mentioned a bit in /r/politics as does /r/PoliticalDiscussion , at least I mention them to people.  If you're looking for a balancing ""right wing"" sub that isn't as freakish as T_D then you may want to try /r/uncensorednews . It's defiantly right wing but not quite as rah-rah President Trump as the other one.  I'd also suggest you hit /r/NeutralPolitics , it's far more sane than either of them. Not really. R/worldnews is usually very rational in it's comment section. Nowadays they don't stamp your actual passport anymore, but good luck getting into any of the Arab countries, Iran or Pakistan with Israeli stamps on your passport.  Because they don't recognise Israel, if you have their stamp in your passport, it's no difference to me writing Republic of Durkastam in crayon. By their law, you have defaced/forged your passport, which is why you can get arrested/deported if caught.  It's a ridiculous head in the sand approach to diplomacy, but it's what they do. Honestly the part that scares me the most is how carelessly they pushed this EO through. You would hope the government would be competent enough to get something like that right the first time.   it only changed for green card holders though not for others with valid visas They stated they changed it, then clarified those green cars holders and legal permanent residents would be allowed in after having to go through a security check. Of course, like everything this administration had done, there are conflicting reports as to what that means.  Funny thing is, Trump's agenda has been published for months and the media still pretends to be surprised. He's doing what he promised during the campaign and supporters are loving him for it.   That, and I don't think the opposition parties were prepared for his pacing. As soon as they're reacting to one move, he's done two more. All the while the [wheels of the House](http://docs.house.gov/floor/) and Senate keep turning in relative peace and quiet. They simply can't keep up with him. I haven't seen this much activity from the Government since the Reagan days.    ""I know right!""  However, people act like banning people from certain areas is this revolutionary new racist concept.   I mean most of the civilized world has had some sort of ban from travel from somewhere, sometime in their history.  In addition this is only a 90 day suspension, that's not so much a ban as it is a... you know; a suspension.  Edit: some clarification The Anarchist and Communist bans do. Anarchist terrorism against business leaders, political figures, innocent crowds, was a regular occurrence and stopped. President McKinley was killed by an anarchist. UN Condemn Arabic countries? I'd love to see the day that happens.  Co-kai-een-eh? Global police force implies the un has the ability to enforce anything without the consent of the super powers. I don't think the un is nessasarily bad or useless but it saying shit like this is about as meaningful as your or mine opinion. What else would it say?   ""Hypothetically if Israel did exist, even though it totally doesn't, you wouldn't be allowed to go there"" He's saying that the UN isn't concerned with righting the much worse wrongs in SA , on the contrary it is worried about the much less  urgent (compatively) problems in the US. [removed] [removed] That's not as bad as I thought it would have been. Well, congrats.  I've basically given up on /r/pics. There was a photoshopped picture at the top of r/pics today. I was shocked it actually made it that far with all the bullshit pictures of signs making it to the top. No kidding. I don't even bother going by /r/pics anymore. Every other pic is of a protest sign. We get it. Can we go back to great landscapes and cats again? The worst thing to happen to /r/bestof was the removal of /r/politics as a default sub. Bestof restricts posts to non defaults, with politics being removed, it gets flooded with politics submissions  its either reposts or the anti-trump circle jerk that it's been all week [removed] Personally, I'm confused, which is why I stick to what I know: pornography. I used to be more left leaning, but overall the amount of angry (very) left leaning people saying everything negative they can about any opposition is making me less and less left leaning. I'm still mostly left leaning socially (economically I'm more right leaning) but I don't get anywhere near as involved as I used to just because of the sheer mass of threats and slander flying all over the place.  I wish we could just have normal discussion rather than ""FUCKING RACIST"", ""STUPID LIBTARDS"", ""DUMB FUCKING BIGOTTED CRACKER"", ""RETARDED MILLENIAL PIECE OF SHIT"", etc. I miss ""I disagree with your policy on this."", ""Oh, why?"", ""I feel that x would be more effective."", ""that's a good point, I'll take elements of that on board in the future."".  [removed] I used to consider myself ""left"" as in far left. But then I realized that morons exist in liberal areas just as much as conservative areas, and even though I'm mostly liberal, I hold some different views.  Currently, I'm ""moderate"". I take in information given to me or I read or listen to, and I think about it until I believe I have an informed decision that stands up to interrogation, and is a platform that shows I care about people and freedom.  I used to lean left, but a lot of what I'm seeing the left turn to after Occupy Wall Street and other movements has come to push me to the right. I'm seeing people post, and get largely up voted, calling for the forceful disbanding of the Republican Party, and its leadership charged with treason (as well as other members of its support base) purely out of a dislike for how the election panned out.  I'm also seeing a huge rise in focus on stuff like gender politics, LGBT issues, and attempting to basically grab as many guns as they want, while essentially ignoring any issues of government fiscal responsibility while focusing on stuff like free healthcare and college.  I love the idea of free college and healthcare, but I also worry on the massive impact it'll have on the economy, which is only recently starting to pick up again thanks to some fairly wise economic policy decisions under Obama.  Is there anywhere I can turn to be fiscally responsible without having to turn in my guns, or have people getting abortion banned? I want fiscal conservatism and social liberalism. Let me enjoy my guns, let rape victims get abortions...   But whatever party I choose, I'm either saying abortion is murder, or picking up the cross that people need 50 different gender pronouns and guns are bad.  So given the choice between two shitshows, I'm stuck on the lesser on the right. I unsubbed from /r/politics and /r/news because of astroturfing during this past election season.  It was just crazy, and VERY one sided.  You literally could not get an opposing view in without it very quickly being downvoted so much that it would never be seen.  Seeing as how news and worldnews are operated generally by the same mod team as /r/politics, I don't doubt one bit that it's happening here and there as well.  I've noticed some of the same tactics in the comments here. This idea of Gandhi as a pacifist isn't really accurate or helpful. Gandhi preferred nonviolence because he considered a person, who has the capacity to fight back violently, taking a nonviolent approach to be the highest form of courage and strength. He was not really coming from any moral opposition to violence out of some concern for the victims of that violent resistance. And even then, he argued that if one does not have the courage for this nonviolence, then to fight back with violence is better than to flee like a coward.  In any case, leftists who advocate deploying violence as a tactic against fascists aren't usually simultaneously advocating dogmatic pacifism. ""Left"" is quite a broad umbrella, you're probably thinking of two entirely different groups of people.  On a side note, the actual news portions of fox news are pretty good.  > For you and everyone reading this, please try and remember that conservatives and liberals are not enemies. We disagree, but as long as the discussion is logical and fact based its healthy.  I'd love to think most people understand that, even though we disagree, we're not enemies. The issue is that there are people, organizations, and governments out there with a vested interest in making it seem like we ARE enemies.   Unfortunately, for a lot of people, their efforts work.  I'd love it if everyone saw more eye to eye, that we could find a compromise everyone can agree on with everything, but it's going to require us to take an active role in spreading the word that though we disagree, that we have differences, we shouldn't consider each other enemies.  As they say, united we stand, but divided we fall. You think fax alone and not MSNBC or CNN is driving the enemies bullshit? I think you may not have watched those channels recently.  Did you turn on CNN/MSNBC lately? They are doing what Fox is, but for the other party. Every single Minute of Footage. Thank you. Discourse is an important part of the formulation of solid ideas.  People are different, but in the end generally want the same end, what's best for the country they live in.  When we start to vilify the political opposition, we take out a great resource for cultivating a properly thought out point of view.  /r/politicaldiscussion isn't really as neutral as it used to be.  It got brigaded by Clinton supporters when they didn't like how /r/politics was overrun by Sanders supporters. There are multiple tourist attractions around the world that will stamp your passport with a fake stamp and it's not a crime If thy don't recognize Israel how do they vote against it all the time in the UN? Alternatively, I'm kind of glad he made that EO. I don't support the order in the least, but that is why I'm glad he made it. Before the order, I was worried how much the checks and balances would work to keep Trump in line. After this, I feel slightly more confident that we can avoid some of the crazier things. They said it was not announced so as to not let people have time to circumvent it. The initial order was supposed to grant waivers to in transit people and emergencies etc.  This is probably the most important and underappreciated part of this whole debacle. Limiting entry based on country of origin isn't exactly a new trick and has it's uses. Not understanding the impact it has on US legal residents and people who were, in fact, thoroughly vetted shows a complete lack of appreciation for the complexity of so many situations the president faces and the immense power wielded by the office. Whether one agrees with the intent of the executive order or not, it is very hard to argue that the implementation wasn't completely bungled and Trump, as head of the Executive, is ultimately responsible for that.  >Honestly the part that scares me the most is how carelessly they pushed this EO through. You would hope the government would be competent enough to get something like that right the first time.  We need to remain vigilant - it was not careless, it was deliberate.  Absolutely deliberate.   It's been impressive to watch. You're also right, he's doing what he said he would do. Anyone who has watched his speeches in the primary can't be shocked really. It's a suspension because it's all he can do by executive order, I believe.  Targeting green card holders/valid non-immigrant visas is bizzare and apparently was done at the behest of Bannon. It's good that there was enough public backlash to soften the green card clause.  Also I dare say the green card clause may have been unconstitutional although we don't know at this point. I don't think anyone is claiming its a ""new"" racist concept.   More like we tolerate racist policies less than 30 years ago.  Something along the lines of   ""Only the countries we recognize"" > This passport is valid for all countries of the world*  > ^*This ^does ^not ^include ^Israel I suppose they could call it something like 'Occupied Palestine' or something? The UN condemns both. They have no power to fix either. [removed] I've long since filtered /r/pics from /r/all. That is a stroke of genius. I know you're joking, but I've never been so confused about politics in my life. I feel like I'm completely disconnected from what is better or worse at this point, and I don't understand why various sides think that the answer is obvious when it really, really isn't.  I guess I also stick to what I know: computers, video games, and philosophy. That's funny I consider myself more to the right, but with a left leaning social view, basically the same mix and I can't even go on to Facebook now. I am right there with ya.  Completely agree with you there, I see mostly people screaming at each other than actually making any valid points. This is exactly how I feel. I've always been left leaning, VERY much so while I was in high school, and I'm still all for equality, gay marriage, etc.  But the constant whining coming from all my leftist friends, the unrelenting accusations of racism, sexism, misogyny and so on towards anyone who even mildly disagreed with them, the pathetic virtue signaling, the straight up lying, as well as the holier than thou attitude they display, particularly in the weeks leading up to the election when they were certain Clinton was going to win, was enough to make me despise that side.  It's been said before, those people are part of the reason Trump won. They managed to turn away many people who were on their side, and instead of learning from their mistakes they are just doubling down and continuing on their path of idiocy.  And these aren't ""the extremists"". These are normal everyday people, people I'm friends with who were always welcoming and accepting and loving just like myself, but were sure as fuck never extreme about anything. Now they are screaming about the wage gap, sharing bullshit fear mongering articles, blocking people who don't blindly agree with them, etc. And of course you have the Huffington Post, Buzzfeed, MTV,  Cracked, Polygon, The Verge, or the other 90% of mainstream sites that keep on feeding that side with more bullshit that normalizes and ""validates"" their belief that men are sexist, only white people can be racist, women get paid less, or any of the many other stupid claims they have been pushing and arguing about.   It's exhausting. And it's everywhere. I just want to have some honest discussions with people, but anytime I try I'm either met with silence, mockery, or baseless accusations.  Sorry that turned into a bit of a rant.. You should give Dave Rubin a listen, classical liberal guy  https://www.youtube.com/user/RubinReport Identity politics are out of control!   Your comment is like something I would write. Like it was taken straight out of my head. I really hope more people start seeing this! Birds fly with 2 wings yo, left and right, not just one. This is true.   And it's why, even though I have a conservative-leaning colleague, I actually like talking politics with him because he's well-read, gives examples, and doesn't result to T_D or Fox News circlejerk, and doesn't insult. You haven't changed, the left has just moved and dragged the scale out. The right did this a while back and my place on the scale moved left of center when the center moved right. Now the left has moved more extreme and your place is considered right of center. It sucks for for all of us.   As more people move to the extremes and away from the center, their view of the opposition starts to include those in the center. Their new perspective can't distinguish you in the middle from those at the other end.  Think of it like a football field on an overcast day. We were all standing on or around the 50 yard line. We didn't have jerseys with our team colors, but a little pin to help identify where we fit. It was easy to see where everyone is standing and it was easy to talk to them. We could easily uidentify their pin if they wore one, but could also see the rest of their style. But then one side moved to the back of their endzone. Now they have a hard time telling if you are on the 50 still or on your 40 or their 30 and the only way to communicate is by yelling. They replaced their pin with a full uniform of their color so you can easily see them from across the field.  Now the other side moves to their endzone. They can't tell where you are either. They start wearing a full uniform of their color to distinguish themselves at a greater distance. They certainly can't hear the other endzone and can't tell if you are talking or someone from the other endzone. They can't see your pin either. As more people move to, or are dragged to, their preferred end zone, the middle thins out. Now each side can't even see the people in the middle. All they see is a mostly solid wall of color on the other side.  Then one side figures out they aren't getting their message out with everyone yelling, so they start to yell the same thing. Something easy, something clever. Now more join in. More is louder. Louder means more people can hear the message. The other side hears it and begins to chant their catchy slogan as well. Louder means more listeners. Catchy means they will remember.  But even that is not enough. They need more messages. They need signs so they can read as well as hear the message. But paragraphs don't make good signs. A picture is worth a thousands words though. Lets put pictures on the signs and slogans at the top and bottom.   And here you and I are, standing in the middle of the field with our little pin. We try to have a conversation, but are drowned out by the cacophony coming from either end. It starts to drizzle. We are all getting wet, but then the umbrella salesmen show up. But they only sell umbrellas in team colors. They sell out of those and bring in ponchos and waterproof, pre-made, signs. The slogan may not be exact, but close enough. ""You are wrong!"" Is essentially the same as "" I disagree"" anyways.  Eventually we may get tired and just go home or worse, give up and join a side. I have contemplated both, but for now I plan on just standing here in the rain hoping those people who moved to the endzone will come back. I hear thunder off in the distance. A storm is coming and I hope those people standing under the goal posts realize where they are before the lightning strikes. There are idiots on both sides... unfortunately... When they start using insults to back up facts on either side rather than acedemics then their view has no perch to sit on. Even worse than that in my opinion though is when people slant or skew numbers and facts to fit their narritive because it actually sways people. It's why I love and hate reddit, so much information including the good, the bad, and the ugly. Basically me in a nut shell. I'm socially liberal, fiscally conservative. I try to frequent both sides but it's getting harder and harder to find the tolerant left. I still have friends who are left leaning and can have good discourse with. But my liberal friends from college have deleted me from FB because I spoke out against the violence and hypocrisy even though I didn't vote for trump. Oh well.  Wow..  I can't tell you how good it feels to see there are other people that feel the way I do.  I also have socially liberal leaning beliefs mixed with fiscal conservatism.  Seeing how insane both sides are getting is both infuriating and frightening.  Glad I'm not the only one out there. Fucking amen. I'm in the same boat and am just disconnecting here. I rarely feel like my voice matters anyway, and having people on both sides hate you because you see both sides of the issue makes it not even worth talking about politics right now. Thats because most of the people slinging hate cant even vote. And wouldn't know a fact based statement if it hit them between the eyes. [removed] You can still call for fiscal responsibility and lean left.  You can aspire for the utopian free college ideals but demand reasonable plans to get there.  Remember that what you see in these public forums is always the extreme if either side.  The loud minority dominates while the reasonable middle ground makes up the majority in reality.  Don't let either side push you one way or another with their rhetoric.  Keep being you, think about things critically, come to your own conclusions about what you believe we should or shouldn't be doing. u/allyourexpensivetoys is a user I found earlier. A clear plant designed to insight division amongst people   I try not to watch the news much anymore, but last time I watched the news segment I was pretty surprised it was not dripping with rhetoric.  The reporters seem to be challenging  a lot of what republican politicians were spouting, and it seemed pretty balanced.  When it came to the pundit hours however it was like watching the chancellor from V for Vendetta. If it were not for Fox News however, I probably would of never noticed how biased towards the left some channels are.  It could be that one is the result of the other, and they just reciprocate the biased slants to deny the other side an edge. All its done for me and my circle of friends is make us take every news story with the assumption that the news is going to slant it towards whatever the bigwigs on top think it should be.   edit: I don't always catch typos, but when I do its after I hit the submit button. Trouble is getting people to even admit there news source is biased.   There was a post the other day charting the news networks bias. They advocated that CNN was a non-biased news network and one of 3 other stations that you should watch. They fail to see that this is the equivalent of a conservative calling Fox News unbiased.   If you want no bias go watch C-span or PBS. CNN is terrible. I say that as a person who leans left.   I kept switching back and forth from CNN to FOX yesterday to compare their coverage of the immigrant ban, and man. CNN was just ridiculous... condescending tones to people trying to explain their views on the ban, talking over them. False narratives.  Fox was having actual interviews and it seemed like the reporters also didn't agree with the ban which was both surprising and promising. They were having rational discussions, people who agreed with the ban, people who disagreed with the ban, and people who agreed something like this needs to be put in place, but that this was a terrible and unconstitutional way to go about doing that (which is my point of view, personally...).  But man, CNN. What are you guys doing.  I don't think the presence of Clinton, Sanders, Trump supporters is important to be honest. I think the important thing in a good political sub is the rules and the mods. If the mods enforce the same rules on everyone it helps keep the sub interesting and allows those who aren't subscribed to the dominant ideology a voice.   Being in a sub that is unkind to your preferred ideology is in my opinion preferable then being in a sub that out right bans things it disagrees with.  Why on earth would anyone let some place like that do such a thing? Potentially it is. Any marking (written or stamped) in a passport could be considered defacement or forgery of your passport.  Depending on the country, they may ignore it, as is likely the case for an obvious tourist attraction. But technically it is illegal and this, coupled with the hostility towards Israel, will give them more than just cause to deny you access. With enough hate, no degree of hypocrisy is too much. Yeah, I get the feeling that there's going to be a lot of back and forth like this for the next few months, at least. I agree absolutely. There should probably be some sort of change, but this was just reckless. I'd rather see something like this go through Congress but obviously that'll take time which is why Trump pushed this through. The Libertarian in me is hoping this gets people to reevaluate the power we want one person/party to possess.  A president actually doing what they said they would do? That is shocking, and it's funny in a way /r/pics has been a garbage sub for a long time, IMO. Even though it seems people were calling it out, there are still wayyyyyy too many pictures that get to the frontpage of r/pics that are just of some random person with a sob story attached. If you don't read the title it's literally just a picture of some dude.  > That is a stroke of penis  FTFY > I don't understand why various sides think that the answer is obvious when it really, really isn't.  This has been an issue with politics since like, the dawn of time. Most people are convinced that they are correct and their opponents are simply lesser people; less intelligent, less informed, less compassionate, etc... And those that attempt to stand in the middle and be observant/understanding are ridiculed for being spineless or for some perceived lack of knowing in regards to ""the issues"" that everyone else is convinced are so obvious. The internet has made it easier than ever to pick a position *then* dig up information to support it. Instead of seeking out information from quality (albeit generally boring) sources *before* coming to a conclusion many prefer to go straight to conclusion, express it as an obvious fact, look up supporting info only once said conclusion is challenged, and argue with people who have done the same thing. Then we call each other names like fascist, elite, communist, etc and rehash the argument on facebook because, obviously, all the people we haven't seen since high school care about our stance on controversial issues. I know the feeling.  I have always loved politics and debating with people but lately it's be just so terrible I no longer enjoy it and have really stopped doing it as a hobby. Which sucks It's times like this that we realise how desperately america needs to go either non-partisan or multi party. If people could just vote for what aligns with their views rather than get polarised into one of two parties and fight the other to the death then I feel politics would be so much easier to discuss without so many angry people screaming. > basically the same mix  Having a healthy mix of views has been a hindrance to political debate for quite some time now, but this has moved even beyond that.  It doesn't matter if you're squarely on the left or right end of the spectrum, if you don't blindly hate people because of their political affiliation to the point that you're willing to overlook lies or misleading reports then you won't have a good time.  Just correcting an error or calling out a lie gets you labeled as a sympathizer or supporter of the person the lie was directed at.  It's insane now.  But dude, don't you know that fakes news is a huge problem that influences people, but it's only right-wing websites that are fake news?  You just need to open up your mind and see the truth of the world like the super smart readers of HuffPo do!  /s Same situation, one thing that really stood out to me as a prime example of this attitude was when, after the election (just after a load of stuff happened where a few of my friends ganged up on another person for saying that Trump won't be as bad as they think) one of them said ""Lol, I can't understand why anyone would even vote for Trump if they're not a bigot."". It's just the huge disconnect and not realising that Trump didn't stand for ""lol, fuck mexicans/muslims/women/whatever HuffPo decides he hates."", that he actually had policies that were gaining traction among the average people but they were too caught up in the headlines to actually look at it from any other angle. It seems like there's a lot of people that agree with us on here, I think this election really goes to show the need for a multi party system in America. and they're usually the loudest We're out there, probably in larger numbers than you'd think. Generally the views of anything other than the main candidates are under-represented and the people with any sort of nuance in their views have to choose the lesser of two evils.   Basically, America needs to go non-partisan or multi-party so it can have a leader that the majority actually want, rather than a leader that the majority dislike less than the alternative. [removed] It's a bit hard to keep being you when you perceive yourself as left and you do want free college and healthcare, but all your liberal ""friends"" think you're a monster simply because you didn't vote for Hillary... This is key: talking head segments are just biases and opinions. Actual news reporter sections are the go to.  > Potentially it is.  But *actually* it isn't, because the real reason that Muslim countries ban anyone with an Israel stamp on the passport is not the apologetic reason you concocted but because they fucking despise Israel beyond comprehension. Honestly reddit as whole has been on a downward spiral for a long time. I've been on reddit for about 7 years and now i pretty much only pay attention to subreddits that pertain to my hobbies. I try and vote on what goes with my views and not a party line. My current career makes that difficult, if they find out you aren't voting straight dem they will make your life hell. I'm already seen as a redneck who leans right, but they don't know what my voting preferences are because some issues I have left leaning views. I'll tell ya, I really like some of the libertarian parties views, I did not like their candidate at all unfortunately. That aside I really really wanted him to get invited to the debates to at least have a third voice and maybe make it less of a well he did this and she did that Fucking grade school playground argument.  Actually debate some issues and maybe force them to actually express their views.  that is exactly what people did with Trump.  Yes he is right wing on many issues.  But left on others, most notably his plans to bring manufacturing back to America, which appeals to blue collar traditionally Democratic voters and is against GOP-business interest policy.   Exactly! I'm sure some bigoted people voted for him because ""imma build da wall"" or whatever, but to claim that everybody who voted for him is a bigot is just dumb. But again, it lines up with the narrative the media wanted people to buy, that Trump and ALL his supporters are hateful and violent people that we should be afraid of and fighting to the death.  is there a subreddit for this? my blood pressure would likely be far lower if there were. A loud babbling brook is often the shallowest. Or some such similar shit.   I look at it this way, if you wouldn't stop to listen to the words coming out of their mouths if they were the homeless guy with a bottle shouting at you while standing near the train station, why would you listen to the same words, still shouted, coming out of a well dressed person's mouth on TV or at a news conference?  I wish we could just vote for a person and what they believe themselves. Screw their affiliations and obligations to their party.  Doing that would likely result in a leader being elected by a plurality, not a majority. Not that it'd be a bad thing.

"32",31,"5r0p3z","2017-01-30","4 million is what google spends on food in a week.  A company will lobby for a ""cause"" that will make them more money.  Hmm... who would have thought.. A refugee family costs about $250K for the first five years. That's to get the ""situated"" and such. Not dissing the number, you need rent, public school for the kids, food stamps for the parents, transportation, English as a second language for the adults, maybe even some on the job training, not to mention the paperwork behind the legal status.  So google, the half trillion dollar company, the company that made 80 billion dollars last year, the largest company with arguably the least overhead and biggest market dominance, has just paid for 16 families. Out of the 5 million refugees.  Maybe, juust maybe, this was a very well timed publicity stunt. ""fund"" or investment?  EDIT: if a pharma company would have done the same would they still call it ""fund""? I have a question - why are they waking up NOW when Trump did what he did? Where were they when the immigrants and refugees were trying to get in to other countries and still needed help? While $4 Million is a lot more than I am able to bring to the table, it seems like a bit of a laughable number for Google. Yay, another another thread where racial prejudice makes zero sum economics okay. And their workers stage a walkout. Starbucks is pledging to hire 10,000 refugees in the next 5 yeara around the world. Source: [CNN](http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/29/news/companies/starbucks-hiring-refugees/) they made 90BILLION dollars in profit last year and are moving to europe for less taxes. slow clap for 4 million. They invested in cardboard and sharpies.   One might think it a crime to aid and abet the violation of Federal law.  From Starbucks to Google, the media, the sports community and Hollywood,  universtities, schools,  and churches, along with many congress-critters, senators, governors, mayors and 501c's - all are in collaboration to violate the law.    This is different from someone sneaking across the border, or cops pulling people over and checking immigration status.  [edit - corrections, clarifications, amplifications] Because they need the H1B Visa program for salary negotiations to pay American programmers less. What the hell?     Where did all these crisis funds and free lawyers come from?   Why the fuck didn't this happen for vets, homeless or rundown communities.    I mean, it's a good thing, I get that but what was wrong with helping out Americans? Keep in mind, google also sent $10.62 billion USD in royalties to Bermuda based company registered in Ireland.     So keep that in mind when they ""claim ""to help   Source: The Wall Street Journal. Jan 23rd 2016. Sam Schechner and Stephen fiddler      The largest hypocrite on the block.    My thing is why haven't the people come together this hardcore for our own issues?

They are going to need it when the h1b visas get nixed That's how much they save by employing cheaper non-American resources. 4 million isn't much to google, it's practically toilet paper money. But it does seem like enough for such a cause Yay! Who cares about those needing help in the country lets help the immigration cause first. I'm glad that they're attempting to help. Having a company like Google push forward against the bigotry that is now unfolding is definitely a plus; however, you've got to realize that setting aside 4 million dollars isn't going to do shit. The progression of what's to come is at a much larger scale.  I am so glad that companies come out of the woodwork after a president creates bans... Where were their fund for families affected by Drone strikes under Bush and Obama.  Edit: My point is Immigrants that have the resources to come to America don't need the charity as much as those that is being effected by war and drones. Imagine them caring about their own people even half as much as they care about the foreigners they use to suppress wages. I'm glad to see this is not only their largest giving campaign, it's one which will fund already established aid organizations like the UNHRC and the ACLU.   Let's continue to encourage folks who are actively resisting hate and racism. The response from grassroots protests and resistance efforts is heartening, but this is only the beginning.  [removed] I'm waiting to hear about everyone boycotting Google. Anyone? Anyone?  Yeah. Didn't think so. Interesting as soon as a provocative move is made the millions start flying in from every sector. Maybe Trump will save money. He said fuck nato, Europe spets up with nato spendins so USA doesnt have to chip in. Trump says fuck Abortion, Europe steps in and gives more money so USA doesnt have to. Trump says fuck immigrants, all private companys start chipping in. His madnes is somewhat turning out good for USA. that 4 million is probably for their own immigrant employees  ""Logical Fail"" And they can't just reset my password without an act of Trump? I'm sorry, I am not for our presidents decisions, really don't like any of them.  When will people realize that this is just as much of our problem as Trumps decisions.  Education, hunger, homelessness are all domestic problems as well.  These people who run these corporations will hide tax revenues from their own people then give it away for PR.   When you make all your money from the system in which creates refugees this really doesn't cut it. It's better than nothing, but if it appeases people and makes them overlook the underlying economic antagonisms in in geopolitics, then it isn't worth it.  Yeh I know, something good happens and I'm just trying to ruin it. It's not my fault the world is so fucking terrible... Nobody cared about the immigrants until trump put the ban on.  Action -> Reactiong alt right fucktards :) Now Google, Starbucks, Tesla and soon also many other bug tech giants. Hahahha this is hilarious alt right are coming with ""but.. but vets, homeless people why they don't spend the money on them but for those filthy muslims?!?!? omgg boycott them""  Why the fuck should they? Your fucking government is responsible for homeless people, especially VETS who engaged in the war and now are rotting on your streets. You don't see this in Europe, you know why? Because they actually care for human life unlike US.   If these cunts paid taxes that would help allot more people. The article failed to mentioned that the employees initially raised $2 million and that Google simply matched their employees.  http://www.theverge.com/google/2017/1/30/14446466/google-immigration-protest-walkout-trump-googlers-unite This is called Public Relations So google donates 10 minutes of revenue... How about $4,000,000 for homeless and unemployed *American citizens*? Vets? Folks who need psychiatric help? List is fucking endless. Theyre gonna need a lot more than that. The ocean is set to rise 3 feet by 2100 and that is estimated to leave almost a billion homeless. The immigration crisis is only just starting. America needs to discuss expectation for exactly how many immigrants will be allowed in on a yearly basis going forward. The line has to be drawn somewhere because no one can take all the people who be left without homes.  Hell America isnt ready to take its own people. Florida, North Carolina, costal cities like Seattle, Boston, NYC, DC, etc, are all going to be greatly impacted. Where will *those people* go? You cant just pack up and move 30m+ people inland in America either. It will take a generation to prepare to make sure people are left homeless owning worthless properties that are underwater.   Oh and you know what would happen if everyone turn off oil production worldwide tomorrow, forever? The ocean would *still* rise 3 feet by 2100.  what about a fund for personal privacy ? oh right that doesnt really matter coz then they will lose profit. Guess that's where they decided put their taxes. Wow, I wonder why a megacorp led by globalist billionaires would support immigration and breaking down of populism and nationalism, and liberalism in general. Almost like a more homogenous world is easier to exploit. Almost like a faithful, prudent traditional family has exponentially less profit to extract than a dysfunctional fat couple with only a dog for a ""child"" who spend like crazy every week while drowning in debt for their studio apartment.  Almost like Farmer John and Housewife Mary 300 years ago had happier and more fulfilling lives, free of pollution and usurious debt and existential crises and rampant mental illness and drug epidemics and widespread cancer and obesity.  Almost like the Old Order of the West was what was natural for humanity and there is more to life than libertine degeneracy and ""living in the moment"". Almost like traditions and authority and customs existed for a reason and didn't spontaneously manifest. Almost like most people since after WWII have been slowly indoctrinated by the mass media over decades to rot.  Almost like my ancestors might have been right about a lot of things, and not some jewish producer funding a movie about how white Christian males ruined everything and we live in the best possible time ever.  Almost like most of us have been misled since we were born.  But just almost.  edit: A typo because of my horrible fingers can't even type at this point How about they pay some fucking tax, or gtfo with their bullshit charity when they're ripping off society. Why they don't create $4 million for US hobos in the streets? Or for all the other US citizens in need for help? Is Google a US company or a WC (world company). Eff google. Congratulations.

Nice to see the private sector stepping up as opposed to laying the burden on the citizens of this country. 4 million? WOOOOOOOOOOOOW. Almost had a stroke. Time to change all my browser search engines to DuckDuckGo.com.  I wish this didn't happen  Google only donated 2 mil and no oversight or real explanation for what the money will be used for, but you could not buy this kind of press coverage or PR for that money. As if we have not enough problems,. This president starts new ones and private citizens and corporations have to fill the whole left by the government  hahhaahah fuck you google! 4 mil? More like as little as possible to get good publicity. 4 million? Oh ok, so this is a publicity play for Google, since they're now on board with Trump's cabinet. Got it guys! So it will be $1 for a refugee?    Edit. I got downvoted, for wrong calculation or are you people just butthurt?   $4 million is not that much, you should learn that for Austin Powers already. They should donate it to the ACLU Sergey was actually at one of the airports to protest himself, as he was an immigrant to America years ago. Considering how much that guys worth, at least he got out there amongst it. Fun fact: Google was one of the companies advocating for destroying Qaddafis Libya.  The company that has a part in desintegrating a stable muslim country, is now acting like a savior.  Yup. And it ""looks good"" but that's just a drop in the bucket for them. That'd be like if I gave $10 We all know that Israel is behind the anti-Muslim campaign, why would Google care.  A few million to them is but a drop in the bucket. Governments around the world have jacked up the prices for partner visas to pay for refugee resettlement programs.  So if you want to know what is funding refugees - it is citizens who make the mistake of falling in love with a foreigner. Or fuck off? They don't have to do anything to help at all. Typical disenfranchised liberals thinking companies owe other people anything.  ^(yeah... because the american civil liberties union is listed on the nasdaq.) Maybe they're just trickling down. After all that tax evasion, why not do a good deed? Isn't it always both at some level? The corporate tax rate in the US is 35%  Google pays 1.9% thanks to various shenanigans involving Bermude, Ireland and the Netherlands. Because they don't give a shit, it's a high number to any one of us but to them it's chump change, it's all to make us think, ""Wow, you go Google!"" And praise them. A publicity stunt. And from reading others in this thread I guess it helps with their h1b visas or something regarding cheaper labor.   Even more of a reason to not let them in. If I was a working class or a student or just a young person who needs to make money I would totally object it. Starbucks should first offer jobs to people of the country where they operate who pay for their coffee. Not invite competitive workers from other countries. This attitude is exactly what cause people to vote for Trump. They do indeed ""take their jobs"". Ha, if I tried to get a job in starbucks i'd get laughed out of the place but i'm white so guess i don't get the free jobs going around in 2017. That's infuriating  Four million is still a lot though. Are you talking about gross profit, or net income?  Alphabet, gross, made just over $55B in EBITDA(earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) in FY2016  Net, they made $19B  Source: https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:GOOG&fstype=ii Check your sources before making such claims. Alphabet (the owner of Google) made 16.34 billion USD in 2015. Source: http://markets.ft.com/research/Markets/Tearsheets/Financials?s=GOOGL:NSQ&subview=IncomeStatement You're conflating the GAFAM companies, who are hiring whoever they can from wherever they can, because they have such high hiring bars and weird hiring standards, with the Indian and Chinese consulting companies who are hiring whoever costs the least, and rely massively on cheaper engineers from Asia. The fact that these two groups of companies end up using the same visa is a byproduct of the messed up visa system in the US. Google doesn't suppress wages, if anything its high salaries have single handedly caused a housing crisis in the SF bay area where you can't even rent a studio in sf unless you're an engineer at a tech firm. Tech has its own motivations for wanting immigration.  Its really wage suppression. They pay them the same amount. Huge misinformation. That's not how an H1B Visa works. They don't just hand those out to people they can hire for less than American workers. It's a visa for people who fulfill needs that were not met by domestic candidates. They have the best of the best, and they pay them accordingly.   Source: someone who's on an H1B visa and who has met many people actually working for google and thoroughly been explained their hiring practices.  thats because business exist to make money...they are not around to care for society   Republicans call that the free market   everyone else says its not fair  everyone else looses because business gives campaign donations to both Democrats and republicans equally  You have no idea what you are talking about.   source: works for google The crisis fund from Google is actually employee donations.  http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2017/01/29/exclusive-google-creates-4-million-crisis-fund-immigration-cause/97231876/  This guy gets it... up voted for having common sense, a true rarity. #ProbablyLabeledRacist LOL  The best part of this is that these companies (Saw that Starbucks pledged to employee 10k refugees over the next five or so years) could've done this before Trump.   They are just using the Trump drama to gain more positivism (positivity?) with the public.  because most of the people reacting are pawns being manipulated for agendas far larger than face value and they don't even know it.  This is our own issue. This executive order is going to have all sorts of negative repercussions for all Americans and the people/politicians/corporations who can look ahead and see the consequences recognize it's in all our best interests to stop this now. Please explain how taking measures to protect a nation from terrorists is now ""bigotry"" Because Reddit is a mostly left wing echo chamber.  I am not sure if Reddit was even popular when Bush the Younger was in the pilot seat. I take it you didn't read the article... Is this what you say any time anyone does anything good?  Where were you when XYZ? Sure, you just helped, but *you could be helping more!*  Tell us, what have you done to help others? I'm sure you've done so much no one could say ""where was /u/nardik when XYZ happened?"" Right? It's not bad to be an American. It's bad to be a white male  Much Strawman Take a look at his proposed cabinet. Also Bannon on the National Security Council? It's not looking good. Yeah that is exactly why I hope for... Trump making the world a better place by being an example of what not to do... Well... Did you donate 4 cents? Did you read the article?  The money is going to existing non profits. And it's from employees too... > $100,000,000 IN GRANTS, 200,000 HOURS, $1 BILLION IN PRODUCTS  They also match employee donations to nonprofits... So it doesn't matter what we do. Cool. No need to fund alternative energy. This.  It's one of the reasons the wall needs to be built. Yeah like that is up to them... say hi to NSA, and your shitty US privacy laws.... So many logical fallacies in one comment... Why should they? The state is responsible for this :) https://blog.google/topics/google-org/bay-area-nonprofits-homelessness/  6.2 Million over the last 3 years. How about that, it's possible to care about and address more than one thing at a time. Are you sure? Google does quite a bit of work supporting charities that address homelessness...  (I made that up with no research, which I'm sure you did as well) The article states which organizations the money would be donated to. I'm not sure what you mean when you say no oversight or real explanation. Google has offered a matching program that will donated up to another 2 million to encourage more individual donors to step up. This is a pretty standard funding model for NGOs. With more support the total can be 4 million, maybe not enough, but is very encouraging to see more and more corporations step up and donate.  ... 4 million is a lot of money. Did you read he article? They are.  even reasonable people may legitimately hope for the overthrow of an abusive dictator before it has become obvious that the result has been turmoil.  Yep   Gaddafi was fucking bad, sure, but de-stabilizing that region in such matters is surely not a great way to bring that place to anything better. I missed this news- where did you read it? I'm fairly certain google is a CIA operative  Estimate 5 year refugee resettlement cost in US is 65K. How much money does a visa cost? Character attack. And I don't think google owes anyone anything.  This is the difference between quietly donating to charity at the end of the year and taking a selfie of yourself giving 5 bucks to a hobo. > yeah... because the american civil liberties union is listed on the nasdaq.  how does it matter? H1B benefits IT companies a lot. Or, you could read the article and come to a logical conclusion. First, 10,000 jobs in 75 countries is not an amount to complain about. I'm in Seattle; 10,000 Starbucks jobs doesn't even span more than 4 surrounding counties.  Second: fuck refugees who need gainful employment to contribute to the country that's accepted them? These people are escaping war; they need food and a place to live, and paying taxes on top of that... what's the issue? That someone who's not you might have to look somewhere else for a minimum-wage job? Feel free to put Mohammed as your name on your resume and see how many interviews you get.  Why would you be laughed out? Its not that hard to get a job at starbucks of all places.  Is there something wrong with you or your character? > Ha, if I tried to get a job in starbucks i'd get laughed out of the place but i'm white so guess i don't get the free jobs going around in 2017.  [Relevant](http://imgur.com/gallery/shDmF0L) Well not with that attitude. As someone who's generally ok with the refugee restrictions, I think it's a good move. Helps people out of a shitty situation. Starbucks will obviously (hopefully) look into their backgrounds a bit and give them an ok-ish job to be apart of society.   Win-win all around. The shitty part is that they could've done this without the Trump drama, and are only doing it now to gain the goodwill of the public. But it's a good deed none-the-less.  Why? You aren't entitled to the jobs Starbucks is creating, that is their right to hire who they want with their money. The only responsibility Starbucks, as a company, has, is to increase their profit for their shareholders, while following the law.   Don't like their business practices? boycott them.  It would be less than a cent for you or me I'll take it if no one wants it. Thank you for posting this! It pisses me off when one of these threads pop up and people with no connection to the bay area spread so much misinformation.  Oh, Google definitely suppresses wages - they engaged in an illegal wage fixing scheme with many of their 'competitors' a few years back. However, that has absolutely nothing to do with hiring non-American engineers. Silicon Valley hires the best talent they can, and a good engineer will pay for themselves several times over - it's simply not worth the effort to somehow plan recruiting around the idea of lowering wages slightly for Americans. It wouldn't be a net gain. > Google doesn't suppress wages  That's not following the conclusion of a certain lawsuit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Tech_Employee_Antitrust_Litigation  > In re: High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation (U.S. District Court, Northern District of California 11-cv-2509 [10]) is a class-action lawsuit on behalf of over 64,000 employees of Adobe, Apple Inc., Google, Intel, Intuit, Pixar and Lucasfilm (the last two are subsidiaries of Disney) against their employer alleging that their wages were repressed due to alleged agreements between their employers not to hire employees from their competitors  > As of October 31, 2013, Intuit, Pixar and Lucasfilm have reached a tentative settlement agreement. Pixar and Lucasfilm agreed to pay $9 million in damages, and Intuit agreed to pay $11 million in damages  > On May 23, 2014, Apple, Google, Intel, Adobe agreed to settle for $324.5 million.   Oh yeah, they did nothing wrong! Google settled the lawsuit just out of pure charity ! 100% this!  As someone in the US tech industry, the idea that these large tech companies pay less to foreign workers is completely false. The reality is that there is a shortage of qualified American workers, and these tech companies depend on talent abroad to do what they do. In fact, countries like Iran are known for their stellar engineers and scientists. The Big 5 tech companies (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple) as well as most well funded tech startups (like for example Uber or Snapchat or Airbnb) do NOT pay foreign engineers less, and I know this because I am a foreign engineer with many American friends, and I compared my salary with them. I worked at various startups in the Bay Area and asked this very question to many of my H1B friends there.   People seem to confuse tech companies with tech consulting companies, who DO pay foreign workers less and farm the H1B quota to bring as many cheap Indian immigrants over to America. These companies include Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services, etc. These companies flood the H1B quota with thousands of applications for many thousands of workers currently living in India, and a certain percentage of them end up getting H1Bs to immigrate to the US. When Donald Trump talks about H1B reform, he is primarily referring to these companies that import labour and pay them less than an American.  These companies are abusing a system meant to bring highly paid, high skill workers (like Software Engineers working at companies like Google/Facebook/Amazon/Microsoft/Apple) and using to cheap out on hiring the American worker. These are the companies that need to be punished. I rarely agree with what Trump says, but his solution to the problem is to raise the minimum salary for these workers. This will be a huge benefit for companies hiring in fields where there's a genuine labour shortage (like software engineers in the US), and it will help stop consultancy farms like Infosys from bringing cheap labor to the US.  I think people should really gain some perspective on the whole issue before lumping every tech company together and claiming they're all importing cheap foreign labor. You can see it at /r/cscareerquestions, this issue is at the top of mind for so many companies. If you want more info on this, see here: https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4arxcn/what_is_your_opinion_on_the_h1b_visa/  Your explanation will not be believed because the growing trend is alternative facts where any real facts are countered with alternative facts such as baseless conspiracy and Soros bashing by the likes of almost militant idiots like Milo who shout at the top of their lungs how they are not racist (""how can i be racist and a bigot if i'm gay!"") or something or the other when it's becoming more and more clear what these alternative fact creators are trying to push taking along for the ride with them idiots like /u/555throaway Congratulations America, you have successfully polarized yourselves to two extremes, the middle ground where truth & civility exists increasingly has little room left! Tech jobs pay very well.  If they're being suppressed, what are those job SUPPOSED to pay? You obviously don't work in tech And I have seen it too.  Companies (perhaps not Google) write a job description to specifically match one specific person or a small pool of candidate.  Like language skills in X for some reason or a capability to do Y (whether or not really needed).  To ""make"" the opening for who they want (i.e. not a basically fully qualified in the ""real world"" US citizen). Also people are very squeezed financially so they don't have time always to pay attention to the larger picture. With student loans and healthcare, mortgages, kids, aging parents most people are exhausted and just getting by. nihil0x0x the almighty and all knowing.  Maybe or maybe not. I know what are you getting at but is this your reasoning that their is American military presence all over the world people in the county should be ignored. I'm not saying its a bad thing to help immigration cause, its a good thing but give a helping hand those near you first so they can give the same to those farther from you. Nobody from any of these nations has entered the US to engage in terrorism, so banning their entry doesn't help in fighting terrorism.  On the other hand, countries whose citizens *have* entered the US to commit terrorism, like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, are not banned.  This makes it hard to justify as an attempt to prevent terrorism. It seems like a partial fulfillment of Trump's campaign promise to enact a Muslim Ban, but only against countries where he has no business interests and which aren't powerful enough to retaliate. But they are also among the least likely Muslim countries to send terrorists to the US. Will it protect a nation, though? Considering most attacks that have happened are homegrown terrorists? Also to put Christian refugees before others, is that not bigotry?  Correct me if I'm wrong u/lordhamuelson, but I think you're referring to the growing language of bigotry that is plaguing general discourse too?  Security and bigotry are not mutually exclusive, so your question doesn't make much sense. It's a question of whether you value protection more than you value being an inclusive nation.  If denying the rights of people simply based upon their religious belief and persecuting them all in the hopes of possibly stopping a non-existent terrorist threat (where in reality, it's creating one) doesn't seem like bigotry to you then there's nothing I can say to change your mind.  Because you are assuming it will help secure the country, when evidence suggests it won't, but it will appease those clamouring for the illusion of such security, even at the expense of others. Please don't be English and allowed to vote. Because those measures are total bullshit. Not one terrorist attack was committed by anyone from those countries. You're also 3x more likely to get shot by a toddler with a gun. If this was about safety and not pandering to his nationalist base it would be an actual solution. Oh it was. And at the end of his term, everybody proclaimed loudly that Bush (who was Hitler) was going to cancel the election and rule as a dictator. Then they forgot ever saying it. Nothing changes. it was, it was a Ron Paul echo chamber until 5 months before the election though  If that is true than how are you posting here? That is true. I did what did it change in my post? How dare I pointing out hypocritical actions.? Yes it is hypocritical actions.   I don't care about refugees or immigrants. I was nowhere  when Obama droned civilians, I was nowhere when Bush invaded Iraq and I am nowhere when Trump bans Muslims. I do agree all those actions are necessary on there own validity. I am I ignoring XYZ, yes.   At least I am not ignoring XY and giving intention to Z. While Z is a less charitable cause.  If you care about people maybe care more about those civilian's families being droned under Bush/Obama/Trump/Future Presidents rather than those that have the money/resources to come over to America.    you have mental issues Educated white male.  Yes? That's what I said dude :)  neither is immigration my point was about funding if they can for immigration why not privacy? List them, le rationalist XD 4 mil isnt shit in terms necessary for this kind of crisis. Even the poor should get to know money and politics and should stop thinking of each sum with how it would enrich a single person's life. The result was a given.  The motive was turmoil. Turmoil was obvious to happen by anyone who glanced at history. Most revolutions don't end up the way the people wanted it Reasonable people would understand the results of a power vacuum. Also, that change must come from within. I refuse to give my talent to defense contractors, and now it looks like I won't be applying for google. Each day the list of noble companies in our neoliberal capitalistic world grows shorter and shorter. The only noble route left maybe running your own IT or information health company.... > even reasonable people may  These aren't people.  This is a monopolistic megacorporation with intimate knowledge about almost every human getting involved with politics worldwide.  This is scary stuff.   How Gaddafi was fucking bad? H1B benefits IT consulting companies, like Infosys and Tata, who send cheap Indian labour here. Google, Facebook, and other top tech companies only use H1B as a means of hiring top talent abroad. There should be a distinction. ^(TIL IT hire a lot of people from syria, iraq, iran, etc.) Yeah, that's exactly the problem, that someone else will to look for a job that was given to another someone else. And part of the reason so many jobs are ""Minimum wage"" is because of illegal immigration. If companies had to pay the actual real market wage it would not be minimum wage. For him it is. Maybe he's dreamed of having a job at Starbucks since he was a little kid, but lacks the self-confidence to apply. Hey, that's a Doug Stanhope bit! >Fuck white males  >It's their fault  >They don't need special help  Later...  >Wuh? How could white males struggle! Patriarchy! Privilege! Whiny man-babies!!! ...well it's illegal. National origin discrimination is illegal. So yeah, he should be mad. They should be fined and have their hiring practices cut through with a fine tooth comb  Which is why it's good when big companies can donate a lot of money because it actually makes a difference. If you compare what people make and donate to what a company makes in profits and donates it's not the same thing. You donate a cent help no one a company donates 4 million and can help a lot of people. What they made in profit has nothing to do with it. Would you rather them donate nothing at all? Or, what's the magic number a company is ""suppose"" to donate? Because they don't actually have to donate anything. Rich people have lots of money and are the ones who donate the most. Poor people don't have money to spare so they don't donate much. A donation is a donation and to be upset because a company ""only"" donate 4 MILLION dollars simply because they happened to make 90 billion is ridiculous.  It's still more than plenty of others are doing > Google doesn't suppress wages  That's not following the conclusion of a certain lawsuit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Tech_Employee_Antitrust_Litigation  > In re: High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation (U.S. District Court, Northern District of California 11-cv-2509 [10]) is a class-action lawsuit on behalf of over 64,000 employees of Adobe, Apple Inc., Google, Intel, Intuit, Pixar and Lucasfilm (the last two are subsidiaries of Disney) against their employer alleging that their wages were repressed due to alleged agreements between their employers not to hire employees from their competitors  > As of October 31, 2013, Intuit, Pixar and Lucasfilm have reached a tentative settlement agreement.

You seem to be well uninformed yourself. >due to alleged agreements between their employers not to hire employees from their competitors.  This has nothing to do with H1B visas or the refugee crisis You are arguing an entirely different matter, which shows you don't have a clue about the tech labor market. This is about anti-poaching agreements not using H1Bs to depress wages. what is the effect of supply on demand? What is the effect of a larger pool of labor on the value of that labor? What is the effect of a program that increases supply on the value of labor? I feel bad for the future generations of your homeland and mine, because if history is any indicator of the future, american companies don't raise wages unless they have to, and job hopping is only a viable alternative if there is a shortage of jobs. Inflation, taxes, rent, etc. are gonna screw the younger people over eventually. Better to put a cap on the program and have the companies sweat it out via raising wages to make them fight with each other over talent than flood them with talent and give them all the chips to make sure they never raise wages again.  /r/cscareerquestions be damned, its full of people that haven't made it to the US yet, they'll argue for anything to help them get here. > the idea that these large tech companies pay less to foreign workers is completely false. The reality is that there is a shortage of qualified American workers  Then why at my last job (at one of the largest tech companies in the world) was I working in a shitty contract position while my coworker, a HB-1, was working next to me as a full-timer?  Was my master's degree not good enough?  Bonus - she even admitted that she lied about her qualifications during her interview to help her get the job.  Anyone who argues that tech companies aren't abusing HB-1 is flat-out LYING.   > The reality is that there is a shortage of qualified American workers, and these tech companies depend on talent abroad to do what they do.  Yea, but you have to understand basic economics of supply and demand, its high school level stuff. Where demand is high and supply low, price rises. If there are 10 companies who need an employee each and there are 9 available and no more, the price goes up until one company does something else or shrinks its expectations, because it cannot compete with the other companies  You talk about shortage of qualified people. Yea, there certainly is a shortage. But the reasons for that is the system created the problem it now complains it needs visas to solve. You need experience to be qualified.  Look at blue collar jobs, a qualified tradesman takes on an apprentice who has obtained a certificate of competence. The appreciative, paid as they develop their skills, is after several years on the job signed off and formally qualified in the profession.  Where is the respect or interest in graduates of comp sci? What I see is seriously cynical shit like 'Haha, universities are shit at meeting workplace needs and their graduates are crap'. Penny pinching 'Lets throw out an internship' like its a beneficent act of compassion worthy of a saint. The end take on that system is you have employers running around bemoaning they cant find qualified developers. Work visas then become a convenient tool to avoid an inconvenient truth that the development industry has no interest (or need because of visas) in investing in skilling up the very people it claims to so desperately need. > Tech jobs pay very well. If they're being suppressed, what are those job SUPPOSED to pay?   Just because they pay ""well"" compared to shitty jobs doesn't mean the pay reflect the market value.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Tech_Employee_Antitrust_Litigation  Clearly great developers have higher market values than they were paid for since companies have to do illegal underhanded agreements to not poach to prevent competition on salary, and they recognized the shadiness of it because they had to agree on a settlement after the lawsuit.  Immigration is another tool in the box to prevent wages from climbing even higher, beside agreements between the major companies to not fight over current employees. Google's revenue per employee is $1,154,896. That includes cleaners and secretaries. Just because tech jobs pay well compared to other jobs doesn't meant hat they aren't being suppressed.  I once inquired into a software/networking analyst job for a subsidiary of Microsoft. It started at $10/h, depending on future reviews could be raised to $15/h. High-ranks aside, barley any Americans worked there. https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5r0p3z/google_creates_4_million_crisis_fund_for/dd405y1/ What they're worth? Their worth goes up with less availability to h1b They want to be able to pay them less then they get currently.  It already happened in academia and research.  highly educated immigrants came to the US for grad school and in order to stay accept lower wages which in turn lowered wages for everyone.  I went to grad school with several immigrants nobody wanted to go back.  They often strategized to marry (arranged) and have an anchor baby by their third year. No kidding, a good developer can make over 100k easy, a real good architect can make closer to 200k all said and done (stocks, bonuses, etc.)  Maybe shitty developers need to stop complaining. Given this situation is only about 72 hours old I'd be surprised if most people understood what and how this was done and how it's being challenged. Fuck off with that bullshit. The two Islamist Chechen terrorists bombing Boston were motivated and inspired by Arab radicalism. People in general suffer under extremist Islamic law but pretending Christians, atheists, and other ""apostates"" doubt get the worst of it is ridiculous. What ""rights""? Foreigners have no right to enter the U.S., and they never have. Hahahahahha Hahahahahha no not in the five ish years I've been here. No... But for one entity to donate it is a lot. If Microsoft donated $10 million will you criticize them and say ACLU needs $100 mil? This is pretty shitty logic. Quit your conspiracy theory bullshit. Google has nothing to gain from an unstable Libya in the midst of civil war. I'm also yet to see any evidence of them advocating for destroying Gaddhafis Libya, but even if they did it was at worst it was stupid idealism.   well, the judgment may depends on the timescale. Was the US better off not seceding from the England? Was the turmoil justified?   Also, some revolutions happen without much fan-fare. Like Spain's turning into a democratic constitutional monarchy after fascism.  Revolutions are tumultuous by definition, but some revolutions have eventually ended up in stable (if not necessarily just and fair) governments that lasted for a good while (of course, not government lasts forever).  It may still have been a stupid call on their part in this case, though. Im pretty sure the French did pretty well... Haiti on the other hand...  He had very poor foreign policy and a history of supporting anti west movements as well as a pretty repressive government. I think he was a million times better than what Libya has now but he definitely wasn't great. Well i said that because i was anticipating some hate, like always.   Gaddafi was probably the most decent solution that country had about the matter.His fall was probably inevitable since US & friends got his eyes on him > Google, Facebook, and other top tech companies only use H1B as a means of hiring top talent abroad. There should be a distinction.  The cost on top rung rises when it does on lower level.  And just now Trump restricted h1b visas even more. This is the reason that Google is pushing against the government  Not really. They used it to hire low cost talents from India. Hire a H1B worker, provide free housing/food, gives relatively low salary. Great lifestyle for the H1B worker, great pay for them. Bad for local talents.  And these H1B workers can't really jump around because not every company can sponsor their VISA. It's not about employment anyway, it's all about advertising and public image.  The main concern of a company in a capitalist system isn't morality or ethics, but to make money. If being progressive in a certain way can potentially boost your next annual revenue, why not try it ?  And if being Nazi can be profitable for the company, they also should do it, as rational economic agents (according to the theory). > TIL IT hire a lot of people from syria, iraq, iran, etc.  Childish argument. Everyone knows the next hammer is on H1B and this is going to affect IT in a big way and that is also immigration related policy. Hey, insult the fact that I wasn't able to attend college because my family was poor and I can't get any barista experience because they won't hire 19 year olds without it. It's okay to laugh about me being poor, i'm white.   It's fine for you people sitting with 50k jobs to say ""well let the brown people pour the coffee then!"" and sell people like me out for a pat on the back, knowing the refugee's aren't going to take your software engineering jobs lol. > Wuh? How could white males struggle! Patriarchy! Privilege! Whiny man-babies!!!  Saying that foreigners get easier jobs is not a valid struggle because it's just not true. If you can't get an unskilled job but an immigrant with no skills can, then you probably need to sharpen up on your interviewing tactics because you are abysmal.  You're entitled to whine if you have a valid problem that isn't just 'WAHHH FOREIGNERS' I don't see how it's discrimination based on race. Refugees =\= race, and they said they'd be helping refugees  due to alleged agreements between their employers not to hire employees from their competitors.  This has nothing to do with H1B visas or the refugee crisis.  Also, did you just copy and repost your comment to anything relevant? The discussion is about H1B vs American programmer getting paid less, NOT employee poaching. Please take your attitude elsewhere, I am not trying to fight anyone here.  edit: typo You are arguing an entirely different matter, which shows you don't have a clue about the tech labor market. This is about anti-poaching agreements not using H1Bs to depress wages. I saw this was by [deleted]. I down voted it anyway, and I'd do it again if I could for taking the cowards way out. It completely undercuts the argument that Google doesn't engage in practices that suppress wages.  Now we have to argue about exactly WHAT practices Google engages in to suppress wages...   But this shows they're not above artificially deflating/suppressing wages.  It's not a stretch to say that's what the H1B does. Higher labor supply means lower wages for previously existing employee group, not even taking into account directly lower wages of the foreign workers. A larger pool of labor means that companies can now hire the best of the best in the world. The net benefit is a stronger company with stronger employees, which leads to more innovation and more breakthroughs and thus more economic benefit for the United States (since all these companies are based in the US). These companies see innovation as the business objective, and cost is secondary to creating innovative products. If the US begins to look inward and reject highly skilled immigrants, these companies can and will open offices internationally in countries that aren't as inward looking so they can continue to innovate with extraordinary engineers. They see their hiring bar for engineers as sacred and they won't lower it no matter what so as to not spook employees or investors into thinking the company is lowering its quality bar (and thus giving them a reason to sell or quit). This also means if you can't get a job at Google or Facebook now, it's not gonna make it easier for you if Trump starts putting roadblocks on international talent. Getting an H1B is so fucked these days that companies are already setting up engineering offices in Europe and Canada to house talent that can't get H1Bs for whatever reason.  You know, this is the main reason why Silicon Valley companies are leading the charge to teach young kids how to code in America (through initiatives like code.org). They want to hire more Americans. The high wages are set by the market and in this industry, the economics are so skewed towards these engineers that it's not uncommon to see people have multiple super-high paying six figure salary job offers, accepting one, and leaving the other companies in the dust. The only solution to this is getting people to learn to love coding at a young age, so they grow up to be engineers, hopefully boosting the engineering supply within the US. I doubt anyone can say that tech workers are not getting paid enough.  It's one of those jobs that can either be done at home or abroad.  If there aren't enough engineers in the US, Google can just setup in another country where there is enough staff and link them to their HQ over the wire.  Information jobs can't be restricted by borders, all it does it cause a loss of taxable income and a flow of capital out of the restricting nation because suddenly Google has to spend more outside their home nation. Was your H1B coworker getting paid less than you? Your anecdote is hardly ""abuse"", maybe you're simply not good enough to be a full-time employee. Your masters degree doesn't mean much if you're talking about a software engineering job. I know people who got hired at Google/Facebook/Amazon with no degree after 10 months at a coding boot camp. I think they did wrong, and I don't particularly like being in a position to defend what them for it, but the ""No Cold Calling"" agreements were more complicated than wage suppression as it is applied in most industries.  Part of that has to do with the Silicon Valley microcosm and part of it to the software development process, where revolving technical leadership can derail a successful venture.  For example, Apple hates Google (at least they did under Steve Jobs).  Let's say Google announces a new application that gets a lot of buzz.  Jobs decides to hire away some critical member of the team assigned to the project.  Not because they need them, but because it will hurt Google to have to shift gears in the middle of development.  In response, Google recruits a critical Apple employee that was in press recently in order to worry their shareholders.  These agreements said nothing about stopping an employee from seeking employment elsewhere for any reason.  They were set up to keep these companies from trying to sabotage each other.  Sometimes that included hiring someone at an exorbitant salary, learn what they can about their competitions operations, and then fire them.  One of the side effects (which I'm sure they didn't complain about) was wage suppression, as employees may not have been aware of their market value vs. their salary.  Especially technical workers.  People don't have to be evil to do things you despise. > Just because they pay ""well"" compared to shitty jobs doesn't mean the pay reflect the market value.  I don't think you quite realise how much money programmers are paid these days at major companies. A graduate can receive $100k in salary from Google, and a total compensation of $175k or more in their first year.  So like the guy above asked. How well should they be paying if that's the bad pay?  Btw the banks pay more! You are arguing an entirely different matter, which shows you don't have a clue about the tech labor market. This is about anti-poaching agreements not using H1Bs to depress wages. A figure for revenue per employee doesn't mean that much on it's own.  You may well have a compelling point, but not without providing expenses per employee? In software development, it's a different story. Average salary at Microsoft for a software developer is $104k (source: [here](https://www.glassdoor.ca/Salary/Microsoft-US-Salaries-EI_IE1651.0,9_IL.10,12_IN1.htm)) and that's the entry-level title. There are many Americans working at Microsoft for software development roles because of this (source: [here](http://news.thewindowsclub.com/microsoft-releases-workforce-demographics-report-70483/)). I'm not sure what subsidiary you are referring to, but it could just be an IT company hired by Microsoft for networking, not Microsoft itself. That's an assumption that would require evidence to back it up. > They want to be able to pay them less then they get currently.  All businesses would like to spend less on payroll, so I will certainly agree to this.  > It already happened in academia and research.  Apples and oranges.  The tech sector responds well to market pressures as consumers seek out the best products for their needs.    On the other hand, the academic sector responds TERRIBLY to external market pressure.  Most incoming students have barely any unbiased information regarding the quality of a university before they've already gotten through a couple terms.  College reputations for hiring managers are based on impressions made on them when THEY went to college.  Edit: Also, there are plenty of American grad students that live in academia because they're afraid to take their chances in commercial opportunities (sometimes for good reason).  There were a couple of them in my relatively small cohort when I was getting my masters. Even so, they're still trying to bring those 'good developer' wages down as much as reasonably possible :  https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/01/16/silicon_valley_415m_wage_fix_pacts_settlement/  Why should workers accept to get less than what a competitive market would allow for, exactly? just because they have ""enough"" for decent living? then why not cap what managers and CEOs get? why should good developers have upper limits fixed by anti competitive practices but people at the upper echelons of society get away with maximizing their gains? the goal is to pay them less eventually.  I am well aware at how good tech jobs are.  I have family members who are developers and architects and make triple what I do with a BA degree vs. my PhD. So far it's being challenged on constitutional grounds as it should be. And all of us should reread that document so we can be reminded of what holds us together as a nation and what our American values are. A larger version of a regular otry. It's really bad how distracted I am by your username. (completely off topic)  But I have spent the last five minutes laughing out loud and having strange looks in the office. I know your comment deserves a much better response than this, but Bagofqueef is killing me right now.     Yes, I need to grow up. And thank you for the good laugh! Glad the spirit of what our country was founded on remains so strong in so many people. After all, we all know that the inscription on the Statue of Liberty says ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free... Unless they're brown, then tell them to go fuck themselves."" well you said when ""Bush the Younger"" was in the pilot seat, so I was referring to 2008  I'm not talking specifically about Googles role. Just the war.  Read this mail:  https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/12659 That's precisely because what happened in Spain was not a revolution. The US was better off, the world, not so much. Lol no, we got hyperinflation during the revolution and had to let Napoleon go Emperor and turn the entire Europe into a war zone just to recover... French Revolution wasn't as perfect as the legend says. >Haiti on the other hand...  Doesn't really make it easy when France tells the rest of Europe ""Everybody, they were my prize jewel. Tell 'em to go fuck themselves (i.e. DON'T TRADE WITH THEM)""  So supprting anti west movements are automatically bad?  Why is the west synonymous with good, despite the west being responsible for most bloody wars in the world? Well, he isn't cutting down on them, but increasing the minimum wage for them, which means the IT consulting companies will receive less visas, while top tech companies like Google and Facebook will receive more, as they are willing to pay top salaries for immigrants. This means that there will be more space for qualified immigrants rather than exploited Indian consultants.  As a disclaimer, I do not support Trump at all, and I am not American, but I think this policy is actually beneficial for foreign workers.  That's not true at all for Google and Facebook: https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/29/how-google-facebook-and-others-pay-their-h-1b-employees/  H1B exploitation like you mentioned DOES happen, but by the companies I mentioned earlier - Infosys and Tata. They are the ones hiring cheap Indian labour. In fact, their whole business model is based on it. Good i finally might be able to move up in my IT job.  >I can't get any barista experience because they won't hire 19 year olds without it.  This is a pile of bullshit. My daughter works for them and doesn't have a college degree. Go troll on Fox News forums. You know damn well that the first thing people think when they hear the word refugees is people from middle eastern countries. It's discrimination based on nationality through and through. there's some good points here, and some purely factual information as well, like companies opening hq's in Canada (tho id argue they would've done it with or without increased h1b's, and not just bc Canadians are lovable) but there's also some big assumptions here like innovation in big corporations implying economic benefit for the populace of any country, let alone the US. I will however, meet you in the middle and say that there are studies that argue for diversity increasing creativity, and that the more innovative smaller companies are, the more jobs will be available for a particular country's populace in the future, since they don't have the economies of scale to go global, but again, that's where the paradox starts to arise. > I doubt anyone can say that tech workers are not getting paid enough  so like, what's your stake in it? Why would you ever make an argument like that unless you're an executive or have some large amount of stock that you plan on selling off in the next few years? Do I really have to pull out some bullshit googlable statistics on how heavily concentrated wealth at the top hurts an economy?  >It's one of those jobs that can either be done at home or abroad  yes  >If there aren't enough engineers in the US, Google can just setup in another country where there is enough staff and link them to their HQ over the wire  yes, and im totally fine with that, since it's inevitable.  >Information jobs can't be restricted by borders  yes  >all it does it cause a loss of taxable income   is that all?   >all it does [is cause a] flow of capital out of the restricting nation because suddenly Google has to spend more outside their home nation  if i understand you correctly (employment capital) yes, but is that all? > I don't think you quite realise how much money programmers are paid these days at major companies. A graduate can receive $100k in salary from Google, and a total compensation of $175k or more in their first year. >   I don't think you realize how much money other not-blue-collar jobs can earn either and you are the victim of the typical tunnel vision of the tech worker that demeans himself and looks down rather than up.   Here's the median for devs in San Fran (which has the worst housing prices ever), so counting the entire industry, not focusing on the few that pay decently : http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Computer_Programmer/Salary/778953b0/San-Francisco-CA  Median for lawyers : http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Attorney_%2F_Lawyer/Salary/2334e720/San-Francisco-CA  And good lawyers earn more on average than good developers too.   There's a problem with the inward looking, autistic tech culture. Doctors, lawyers, engineers in other fields, artists and so on have a better understanding of their worth, are more ready to fight for it, and are not putting up with ""hey it's good enough"" nonsense while remaining attached as corporate drones.   The top lawyers can earn more than $1000 **per hour** : http://fortune.com/2016/02/09/lawyer-hourly-rates/  Can the same be said of any top programmer? not at all unless the programmer owns a company / plays with the stock market.   Programmers behave like brainy blue collars. It's not the worst in the silicon valley though, because salaries for programmers are actually much, much, much worse everywhere else. Here in Europe they really are like blue collars. Meanwhile it still earns great money to be an actual engineer, a lawyer, a doctor or a good artist here. Those jobs aren't tied to one terrible place with terrible housing.  Programming is the only highly demanding brainy field filled with people who have so little understanding of social dynamics and who are barely putting up a fight to climb the ladders. The passion for the job/love of computers, the awkward introverted personalities and lack of a sense of defending their trade (most other trades have stronger group think, ask doctors how willing they are to lobby for a cap on how many doctor licenses can be given out! meanwhile bleeding heart liberal programmers are actually siding with immigration and want their labour to be cheapened)  Here's an example for what doctors do :  > While they have not set an explicit quota for the number of doctors, their policies did create a shortage.  Medical miscalculation creates doctor shortage (USA Today, 2005):  >For the past quarter-century, the American Medical  Association and other industry groups have predicted a glut of doctors  and worked to limit the number of new physicians. In 1994, the Journal  of the American Medical Association predicted a surplus of 165,000  doctors by 2000.  > In order to become practicing physicians, graduates must complete at least three years of residency training, usually in large teaching hospitals. Without more residency slots, the number of physicians entering the workforce cannot increase. (If the number of U.S. medical school graduates increased, but the cap were left in place, graduates of U.S. medical schools, who have preference for residency slots, would replace graduates of foreign schools, but that would have no net impact on total physician supply.)  >The logjam in residency openings stems from the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. At that time, the number of residency slots funded by Medicare (the principal source of residency funding) was capped at around 100,000, and that cap has remained in place ever since.  Programming has yet to become a *real* profession/trade, one with strong lobbies, associations, group solidarity, certification processes (why is it that structural engineers need a license but programmers don't?) and so on. Despite the somewhat decent wages in a very few silicon valley companies this profession could still be considered living in an infant state. It might always remain that way because most of the people attracted to it are acting like they are living their dream and a passion and lack pragmatism and more realistic views of the world. There's a reason why game programming is the worst of all (be it in wages or excessive overtime work) programming fields. The higher the passion the stronger the autism and tunnel vision. I never said it was about H1B, I was answering someone who asked how wages could be suppressed in this field and even quoted the sentence but it seems you have terrible reading comprehension like all the tunnel vision autists.  As for the H1B program, it's essentially modern indentured servitude. The workers don't have the worst wages, but they can essentially never ever complain and barely have any job mobility, must drastically plan how to switch to another company because they can be kicked out of the country in only 10 days once they leave a company that abuses them be it overtime or something else. There's already a lot of documentation on how H1B workers are abused, go get an education if you know nothing. Sure. If you look at profits they have about $280,000 per employee, but that number is misleading in the other direction because they are spending a lot on acquiring other companies.  The best two arguments for wage suppression are, in my opinion:  1. The illegal no hire agreement with Apple and others. 2. H1-B visas. Besides basic supply and demand logic and the huge wage differential between the US and countries of origin, it reduces bargaining power of employees thus hired because the company controls their right to stay in the country. Or a basic understanding of the tech scene and economics  I agree completely.  Thanks for posting links.  Science.com has good articles if you search h1b visas etc.. That's a bit of a different discussion but I agree.  Just saying if you are a good developer, you can make a fine wage. Remember, if you queef into a bag multiple times it's still one single queef at the end of the day. Citizens? Were citizens not allowed entry? Goddamn I misread that my bad. Care to elaborate on that statement? I laughed Well from what I've read I know that it wasn't as perfect as it is played out to be. But yeah, very few revolutions have been actually good...  Why did they like Haiti so much? They were doing pretty good with the French.  Yes it is when they're movements like the IRA or JRA or The Black September Movement. He even backed Idi Amin, it's estimated that Amin killed between 100k and 500k people during his reign.  Been /r/hailcorporate recently on reddit for h1b programs as a backlash to trump's opinions towards it. Glad to see someone on the left actually acknowledging some of the benefit of those opinions. I love my non-desperate foreign coworkers, but I seriously could take a break from the ones who come here and are constantly abused. The minimum wage change is good but I'm sure you can understand why top tech companies will be skittish about harsher laws being put in place that could affect them down the line.  Either you don't live in the Valley or have not been here long enough. Are you really that bad at IT that the only way you can get ahead is by banning more immigrants? Do you wanna provide some actual evidence of that? Because the only time I've ever heard of that is part of the white nationalist rhetoric. Nobodies getting hired because they aren't white. If they are, there are some serious grounds for litigation.  The only studies I've seen on racially motivated employment have shown that having a ""black"" sounding name will give you very little chance to be hired as opposed to a ""white"" sounding name.  Why would they target a specific group of refugees? My argument is that these companies are incredibly desirable and highly valued stocks because a large number of investors have determined that they are innovative. I don't really see evidence to the contrary tbh, I mean Amazon is literally changing the face of retail online and offline, Google and Facebook have access to a ridiculous amount of data and creating growth in parts of the world that don't have internet, etc. The economic benefit to the US is unprecedented IMO. Scott Galloway, an NYU professor studying the impact of these companies and has [an interesting talk about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfjg0kGQFBY).  Anyways I agree with your point about smaller companies. The thing is the Valley has so much venture capital cash and expertise and resources that it's really hard for tech companies in other parts of the world to thrive without some connection to the US tech industry. Innovation can happen anywhere but without the market access and prestige and resources a Valley VC would provide, it becomes increasingly difficult to gain traction. Many of these companies end up getting acquired by the big tech companies anyway. Facebook for instance acquired so many companies in Tel Aviv they just opened an engineering office there. I could ramble on about this all day, but my point is that I think it's better for the world as a whole and better for tech/innovation if the US keeps its borders open. All the companies I've worked for in the last 10 years has over dozens of international offices. Part of the reason is because customers are global. The other is, you can't get a visa for everyone.  However, that doesn't mean all top end tech companies don't abuse the system. I've heard of and have friends who are or were part of companies that have abused the system to discriminate their employee demographics. I hate trying to have discourse with people like you who don't even derail their line of thought for one second to consider what the other person is even trying to convey.  You didn't understand me at all.  A low supply with a greater demand is inefficient.  Restricting without regard for such demand is going to create capital flight out of the country, decrease the high bracket tax base and empower other nations by increasing their talent pool.  It's a net loss for nations like America that depend on technological superiority to power their economy.  I've made my point, and if you still can't understand it, my condolences.  Good day. Moving the goal posts doesn't make you right.  > Here's the median for devs in San Fran  This was about Google.  > And good lawyers earn more on average than good developers too.

You have a good point to make and this tangent doesn't serve your goal. It also just makes you look childish. (see what I did there?) > The illegal no hire agreement with Apple and others.  There was no ""no hire"" agreement.  It was a ""no poaching"" agreement.  The agreement did nothing to prevent an employee from seeking employment at a competitor.  It only prevented the competitor from actively pursuing an otherwise content employee to lure them away.  Very much not the same thing.  Edit: > [...] because the company controls their right to stay in the country.  I agree with that.  The flip side is that ideally, you gain access to a greater diversity of creativity when you have a diverse workforce.  Ultimately, I don't think the plight of Silicon Valley programmers should be very high on the priority list (despite my brother being a software developer in Palo Alto), but I do agree that this leverage is being used to decrease payroll in an unethical manner even if it is also more complicated than that. That's a meaningless statement when you don't back up your assertion with facts. that's only gonna last for as long as we need software. Think about after we have biotech systems, AI systems, robotic systems, and VR systems in place. What's going to be left: the stuff that even the weaker developers can do. You can already see this in mobile and web development. Fighting for even higher wages now regardless of your skill will help out a lot of people in the future.   Why do I know this future, look at what happened to mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, aerospace engineering, etc. There's gonna come a time, maybe in your kids days, where companies will have all the chips and they are DEFINITELY not gonna raise wages regardless of inflation. If we push for higher wages now, we delay when that time comes and reduce economic strife or suffering. Hahaha you're killing me right now! He or she may be referring to America's role as world police post-WWII and its [extensive involvement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change) in other nations' political affairs. It hasn't been very beneficial for stability around the world .    And supporting saudi arabia by GB and France is a good thing?  Time to overthrow France and GB and leave their countries in rubble /s It's actually good for Google because they are paying them more thanthe minimum they are required to. So this would reduce the competition for the H1B visas, giving them more. even my indian american friends tell me not to put an indian in a hiring manager position, wana guess why? Been avoiding commenting on these topics but I'm going to step in here:  There are 3 problems with this mindset (speaking from a software development/engineering perspective).   * If all you do is import the top 1% of programmers/specialists from other countries, you don't allow growth of local talent. And if that middle band of talent doesnt grow, you can imagine the long-term effects.   * The biggest issue at the moment isnt actually importing the best of the best. Even decent developers are getting pushed out, because the cost of hiring 1 of them is enormous next to a single developer from India/Pakistan. Disney caused a huge uproar recently when they fired  250 IT workers, then had them train their foreign replacements. They usually keep 1 senior engineer on-board to keep the H1Bs in line, but anyone in software (even on Reddit) will tell you their output is generally garbage. But hey, it bumps up the bottom line.  * When the top engineers are coaxed out of their own countries by the promises of the US lifestyle, youre removing a potential industry leader from their original country. Countries like India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka (my own home), are never able to develop because theyll never have the equivalent of an Ellison, Gates, Musk or Page. Instead, all of the money, credit and development will go to the US  When was the last time merit was a factor in promoting someone? You are naive. Indian boss -> hire Indians and some token White/Asian guys. [...and what of the US people?](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/opinion/alan-kohler/us-election-above-all-this-is-a-middleclass-economic-revolt/news-story/8cb05d079e53236c9ae4e44b29f5b6b5) > You didn't understand me at all.  my bad, im not that intelligent, but I do at least care.  >A low supply with a greater demand is inefficient. Restricting without regard for such demand is going to create capital flight out of the country, decrease the high bracket tax base and empower other nations by increasing their talent pool. It's a net loss for nations like America that depend on technological superiority to power their economy.  Yea, I was being a cheeky fucker, sorry, what I should've not wasted your time with was saying that my argument is thus: low supply with greater demand is inefficient for companies, not for employees, and that companies are moving out regardless of hiring since they can just hire an indian who studied in the US and came back home to work at that company that moved to India. So, who is benefitting in the end: the company! As for your additional argument on the US remaining technologically superior, that's a fair point, but I can't see how the average american has benefited from this or why it would be any different for the average american if Canada was technologically superior. The average american has gotten a really bum deal throughout this gold rush, and h1b programs didn't help them at all. > Moving the goal posts doesn't make you right. >   I didn't move the goalpost, I answered your point with what top players earn in other professions too to compare to your 'top devs', but you on the other hand practices selective quoting.  > Your original comparison was with 'shitty jobs'.

In order to obtain this talent it is not necessary to give companies control over whether their employees are deported.

So, I don't think the stability argument holds from a very general perspective of things, while locally it might have been the case for certain countries.  Yes but it is setting a precident that the Trump government is going to restructure h1b.

I miss the days of 2001 dot com crash. All H1B went home, drastically reduced number of Indians on the streets.

What a bizarre guy. > In order to obtain this talent it is not necessary to give companies control over whether their employees are deported.  Agreed.    Anecdotally, I haven't seen the evidence of that kind of dictatorial relationship through the program, but I acknowledge that it could exist.  My brother-in-law works in San Jose on an H1-B visa as a back-end programmer.  He studied CIS in the US and got the job through a paid internship.  He's been on H1-Bs for a few years (though he filed for a green card late last year and is waiting to hear back), so I'm certainly biased, but from what he's told me, the relationship has been very positive and his pay has been reasonable for the market.  I work in an industry that handles ITAR controlled materials (must be a US person to handle), and I have had a hell of a time getting that level of treatment despite no possible competition from H1-Bs.  I'm not arguing that exploitation doesn't exist or even that it isn't prolofic, but can you see why I'm asking for more than rhetoric to show that this is inherently bad? It's not my job to prove your points for you and the issue is more nuanced than a Google search. It's already too late in some places.  I actually live in Australia (immigrated when I was a baby), and we're starting to see corporations here take advantage of similar systems. Only difference is that it's occurring in the larger engineering community as well.  If you're in engineering/software development, you're either seeing very few jobs or abysmally low pay.  The article here is a decent read because it explains things in plain english:  https://www.crikey.com.au/2014/11/28/engineers-the-canaries-in-the-economic-coal-mine/  In particular;  >""For example, for each of the last two years 5000 engineers were admitted on a permanent visa basis, and approximately 5500 engineers were issued temporary 457 visas. The rate of unemployment for engineers has been in excess of 7000 per year. This is now clearly an immigration/visa policy that is devoid of any logic or justification.""  We have no growth in these areas. And because of what I mentioned above (young people who need training displaced for foreign workers), we have no future prospects for innovation in the tech or engineering sectors. We're supposed to be the ones building the country... > the relationship has been very positive and his pay has been reasonable for the market.  That doesn't tell us much because the market would adjust to a new wage level given an influx of people whose visum is controlled by their employer.   The H1-B visum program's stated intention is to attract exceptional specialists. It is not intended as a wage suppression mechanism. Statistics show that the wages of people who hold a H1-B visum are significantly lower than their peers. It would be very simple to ensure that the intent of the program matches the actual use: tax the companies $X for each H1-B visum worker.  You could also argue that the US should actually allow in any talent regardless of whether US talent is available, but then that should be explicitly stated policy. The ethical implications of that are not simple, because several groups are affected in different ways (if productive people leave their country of origin then the rest of the country of origin is negatively affected, for example).  > so I'm certainly biased  I am also biased in favour of the H1-B program because I am not a US citizen and I may use that program in the future (as a programmer), but in the name of truth I must nevertheless admit that that the program lowers the wages of US programmers. Pretty hard to go into nuance with someone that doesn't even know the basics :/

"33",32,"5r0jvg","2017-01-30","From PH here, they're temporarily suspending Oplan Tokhang (the big anti-drug campaign) to focus more on 'cleaning up' the Police force because of outrage over recent corruption scandals.   The first trigger being the Korean national slay, who was abducted by police under a bogus arrest warrant for alleged drug ties (which later turned out to be made up), they asked for ransom but accidentally killed the S.Korean right insight Camp Crame (Phil. National Police HEADQUARTERS - a huge embarassment). More similar cases have recently been reported thanks to this first one. A Senate inquiry followed.  And then recently another expose by a Senator, a [cctv footage](http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/597241/news/nation/lacson-presents-cctv-footage-of-cops-allegedly-planting-drugs) showing alleged police officers raiding an entire office, rounding up all employees in a room, planting meth (locally called shabu), stealing from the office, leaving, and then the actual uniformed police arriving and then extorting the office for some millions so no one gets arrested. Again, according to Sen. Lacson, not an isolated case, but no one wants to file a case out of fear.   So more public outrage, and trust in the PNP is probably in an all time low (every anti-drug op by police is now in question due to the corrupt activities). The President and PNP Chief came out with some statistics (don't know source - they didn't cite it) that around 30-40% of the police force are corrupt. The Administration is now shifting gears saying they will now focus on cleaning up the institution. (IMO something they SHOULD have done before unleashing all these crooked cops on to the populace and creating this bloodbath). A little context in the title is nice, it doesn't say it's permanent and he may restart it after ""cleansing"" the police.  This might have been the reason he *suspended* it:  ""The move comes after the kidnapping and killing of South Korean businessman Jee Ick-joo, 53, who was abducted from his home in October during a raid by rogue anti-drug officers and brought to a headquarters of the National Police Quezon City. Jee was strangled and then cremated, Philippine Justice Department officials said."" He's been upstaged as the craziest world leader. Maybe he realized that he has enough Fentanyl to last him till he dies.  First you incite extra-judicial killings of drug dealers and drug users to create a murderous smoke bomb that will aptly hide any assassinations you need done. Then, you halt those extra-judicial killings and accuse the police of corruption. Finally, you incite new extra-judicial killings of ""corrupt"" police officers to ensure anyone with knowledge of your clandestine assassinations can't ever reveal them.  Now you have a significantly shorter list of public opponents, and your tax-funded hit-squad is as loyal as ever.  Edit: Received some insight on my word choice. I'm surprised that this isn't at the top of /r/worldnews, this was such a big deal for so many months, and now that it's ending... Nothing? Weird. Is ""We must fight the scalawags"" crazy talk for ""Opps, that got out of hand quickly."" If history is any guide this episode will soon get some kind of moniker like kristalnacht, night of the long knives, the terror, etc. Wonder what it will be. ""scalawags"" I never realized people actually use this word anymore.. Wtf...he's asking the police to start snitching on each other to reduce police corruption?  How well does he expect that to work?  >Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said he ordered the National Police to suspend the country's war on drugs and to ""cleanse"" itself from corruption.  Can't stop crime when the criminals are in the police.  he got all the loot! ....he now has a monopoly. scalawag skalwa,skalwa/ nouninformal plural noun: scalawags a person who behaves badly but in an amusingly mischievous rather than harmful way; a rascal. synonyms: rascal, scamp, monkey, imp, devil, rogue; More US a white Southerner who collaborated with northern Republicans during Reconstruction, often for personal profit. The term was used derisively by white Southern Democrats who opposed Reconstruction legislation. Ah, so the haplorhine primate finally decides to call a ceasefire! Finally got a hug from his mother huh... That's great news. Today Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said he ordered the National Police to suspend the country's war on drugs and to ""cleanse"" itself from corruption. ... Philippine National Police Chief Gen. Ronald dela Rosa on Monday said he dissolved all anti-drug units to shift efforts to fighting corruption. You just knew this grandstanding was going to end in disaster. It failed in Thailand ten years ago too. And now they're thinking, even talking about meth as a prescription drug.  It's time to deal with drugs pragmatically, they are never going away, and until Prohibition ends, it's only going to get worse. Human nature to rebel, human nature to be lured by increasing profits, and corruption. All these drugs are LESS damaging than booze. The science is there. Conservative people just don't want to hear it. Crazy. He probably needs to restock on his stash. Does the Philippines have a different calendar? A ""war on scallywags"" seems very 2016. He should have cleaned up the police and reviewed cases earlier.  You can't operate with rusted implements. Huh.  Who knew that giving people carte blanche to commit murder without consequences could encourage corruption? I guess they killed everyone involved in the drug trade, and everyone thinking about the drug trade, and everyone who read an article about the drug trade, and everyone who once saw movie in which a character does drugs.  Problem solved. I think someone's falling in love with Mary... He needed a smoke break He decide he's murdered enough people?  Oh, no, now he's going to purge law enforcement and go back at it.   I'll believe it when I see it.  No more legal murder? Good news, that should help keeping the violent death toll a bit lower This reads like a press release from a pirate kingdom. Does this mean he'll stop fucking killing everyone? Run out of body bags?... Must have a party coming up... it's ironic this will get ignored because people would rather panic about less of an issue. America should invade the Philippines  Someone likely dug real, potentially incriminating dirt on him, and made him shut up.  He knew cops were corrupt all along which is why he encouraged small time drug-dealers to hand themselves in (and be detained in army camps employed in military duties) - it was to spare them from the corrupt cops who have been killing would-be informants.  I bet he now wishes he he had targeted the cops alone in the first place. Oh wow this is such a huge surprise. Who could have foreseen this happening? I am in shock that something so unexpected could have resulted from Duterte's drug war. This is just so out of the blue. Accidentally killed the South Korean? Last I read he was strangled to death then secretly cremated to cover it up.   Source:  http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/596358/news/nation/bato-south-korean-businessman-was-killed-inside-camp-crame Yeowch. I thought the PNP was like the most reliable law enforcement agency in the Philippines...  > The President and PNP Chief came out with some statistics (don't know source) that around 30-40% of the police force are corrupt.  fuck. or this has been set up as a great false flag campaign to ""cleanse"" the force of anyone deemed too ""independent"" or non-loyal enough, a la. Erdogan. Good summary of the situation. Thanks. Don't Republicans want oil there or something?  Can't we plant WMDs on them like we did before and clean the whole mess up lickety split like Iraq? The drug war he was waging was only supposed to last 6 months. Then he pushed it to a year then eventually his entire term. You see where this is going? ""rogue"". > A little context in the title is nice, it doesn't say it's permanent  >   Sure it does, it's suspended. Not ended, not terminated, not finalized, but suspended.  A suspension is not permanent. Yeah, all his thunder is gone.  Like a vacuum, all the world's attention has now gone to the Eye of Sauron in D.C. Um...this guy gave the police and the people a free pass to murder anyone they ""said"" was a drug dealer.  That is still topping the crazy list right now.  There is also Kim Jong Un, there are plenty of African leaders slaughtering their people, there are world leaders supporting terrorism worldwide...I don't think Trump belongs on this list quite yet all things considered. Top Trumps - world leader edition! >You policemen are the most corrupt. You are corrupt to the core. It's in your system,"" Duterte said .  Yeah, but a comment like that can't gain a lot of love from your non-corrupt policemen that are loyal to you..  That's still pretty crazy imo Just look, the Filter Trump is above Filter Philippines. I assume you mean trump? What has trump done that is ""Crazy""? Or maybe all the rivals he wanted killed are now dead.   Would be crazy if he overdosed on drugs and died. One dose? That's like a third of the annual death toll of the US sponsered War on Drugs in Mexico. Funny how we never hear about that one  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Drug_War Are you kidding? If they had natural resources, there'd be 70K dead and an ongoing civil war. Why should the international community intervene? The people voted him. By the time the Marco's shenanigans came out the US was already persona not grata. Even after that settled I think they made US close an airforce base among others.  There's resources but without 100% commitment is it worth it with all the other locations and techniques out there for what ever. yeah right. Hundreds of thousands dead in the middle east. And no intervention from the international community. Oh wait, it was intervention that started the slaughter in the first place. Im kicking you off your high horse you self righteous idiot. Incite, not insight.  He's been overshadowed by all the other """"""world news"""""" about Trump. Trump giant circle jerk of people wanting to destroy trump. I don't even like the guy and I am sick of all their bitching.  I think it's more like ""Kill them before they (or protesters) kill me"". I say ""war on scallywags"" has a good ring  you overestimate filipino police. Fear. They have seen the purge up close and won't want to be on the receiving end.   Stalin controlled the USSR this way. He said ""suspend"", not end the drug war. Did you read the whole article or just the headline? That is actually mentioned in the article. He suspended the war on drugs in order to clean up corruption. He extended the deadline for the country to be clean of drugs till the end of his term in 2022.   From the article:  >Duterte on Sunday extended hisself-imposed deadlineof eradicating the Philippines' drug problem from March, which was already extended from December, until ""the last day of my term"" in 2022. You had me until the drugs are less damaging than booze thing statement, which is 100% false.  If anything booze can be as damaging as drugs.  And it's not a conservative thing.  It's across the isle too.  If it wasn't Obama would have done something when the dem's owned Washington.  They didn't do a single thing.   If you personally knew someone on meth/crack you wouldn't make this blanket statement.  Not all drugs are the same.  I would only categorize marijuana in the same category as alcohol.  Ya, I thought that way too when I tried the needle. Everything gone in 5 months. 38 years old and on day 17 of my new life.  Meth is already a prescription drug in America, its brand name is Desoxyn All of these drugs are *not* less damaging than booze. Many Liberals are just as horrified of drug legalization as Conservatives. Stop spreading hyperbole and untruths. Factual information is the only way forward. I think you mean 1716 Did you read the article? A Korean business man was kidnapped by cops, brought to a police office, strangled to death and then cremated. The individuals who killed him then pretended he was still alive to collect a ransom from his wife. He's putting the war on drugs on hold because he's going after police corruption. What's more incriminating than admission of murder and rape? >He stopped the war because now he is the number 1 dealer.  No because a few cops killed a dude, then burned his body and extorted his wife for money.  He wants his own police force, that will be bad If he knew they were corrupt, ya gotta wonder why he choose to use them to unleash a huge wave of violence, unless he was counting on it. Kind of fucked up to all the innocent people they've killed since he started all this.  Looks to me like corruption starts at the top.  Indeed! Who would have thought that giving an already corrupt police force cart blanche and impunity would result in a mess like this? Inconceivable! It is one thing to get it wrong and another to admit you made a mistake and completely turn your most prominent law and direction to start improving the police force. From PH    And later his remains was flushed down the toilet but could be rumors at this point. It's the NBI (National Bureau of Investigation), though public perception of them isn't really that much higher than the PNP's. Oh far from it, the PNP has been notoriously corrupt even before Duterte's time (Duterte just gave them carte blanche, which probably made things worse.)  Unless you're being sarcastic in which case you got me :), it's really hard to tell these days.  >Don't Republicans want oil there or something?  you know that many democrats voted for the war too, right?  WMDs in the Philippines would be an entirely different situation then wmds were in Iraq. Until recently Phillipines were on good terms with the US compared to how Iraq sits. Moreover the Philippines do not have specific un resolutions against them Banning them from the posetion of Wmds.    Furthermore trump and duerte spoke in friendly tones last I heard.   You would not see a police action declared by the president or a war by legislature. Unless a lot of wmds were used by the Philippines in quick order.   Edit: don't forget it was Obama that used and threatened police action a couple of times. >The drug war he was waging was only supposed to last 6 months. Then he pushed it to a year then eventually his entire term.  And now he paused it.   Just like Trump's Muslim Ban is only for 90 days, then it'll be a year, then they'll be entered into internment camps for processing and desensitization before being released into the general population. Scary shit when you think about it. Thank God we still can't find the one ring. Oh, so that explains the orange glow coming from that direction. TIL Donald Trump is the dark servant of the lord Morgoth.  Trump wants to destroy the world of men. The Trump thing is a lot crazier than people seem to want to admit.  https://medium.com/@yonatanzunger/trial-balloon-for-a-coup-e024990891d5#.y0ue13p2k  *""Finally, I want to highlight a story that many people havent noticed. On Wednesday, Reuters reported (in great detail) how 19.5% of Rosneft, Russias state oil company, has been sold to parties unknown. This was done through a dizzying array of shell companies, so that the most that can be said with certainty now is that the money paying for it was originally loaned out to the shell layers by VTB (the governments official bank), even though its highly unclear who, if anyone, would be paying that loan back; and the recipients have been traced as far as some Cayman Islands shell companies.*  *Why is this interesting? Because the much-maligned Steele Dossier (the one with the golden showers in it) included the statement that Putin had offered Trump 19% of Rosneft if he became president and removed sanctions. The reason this is so interesting is that the dossier said this in July, and the sale didnt happen until early December. And 19.5% sounds an awful lot like 19% plus a brokerage commission.*  *Conclusive? No. But it raises some very interesting questions for journalists to investigate.""* Don't worry baby, when Trump sends the Feds to Chicago to instate Martial Law, something that conservative people were deathly afraid of but now all of a sudden are cool with, he'll climb the leaderboard very quickly. Trump? I was talking about the mexican president. Plenty of African leaders? Name three. Blegh you and your relativations, this has no place on reddit, reddit is only for my feels not for thinking /s Trump has only been a week. Give it a few months. We are headed into that direction. I'm not going lie, I just saw an easy opportunity for karma.  I thought the businessman was already killed but the family was ransomed anyways as if he was still alive.  Koreans wanted the police chief to resign, but since he is and was Duterte's buddy nothing was done to him. Holy hell, what?!? That's enough to go to war over. Or maybe he wanted to stop while he's still popular. Your own link says ""the Mexican government has claimed that their primary focus is on dismantling the powerful drug cartels, rather than on preventing drug trafficking[.]"" I'm for full drug decriminalization or legalization of drugs, but the war with the Mexican cartels is much more about political control than enforcement. In contrast, the Philippines ""War on Random Drug Addicts"" is about enforcement. You never hear about the war on drugs in Mexico? Do you not own a TV? Probably because it's been the status quo for decades. Mom, can I Godwin this? You're the kind of person who passively watches the word descend into chaos.  No, it's not going to work. The Filipino ""padrino"" system (just look at how close Duterte and Marcos are, despite everything) and PMA (Philippine Military Academy, where a lot of senior PNP officers come from) brotherhood among classmates is something else and too deeply ingrained. You can take that out, but that's not going to happen within one presidential term.  East Germany and the Stasi, for another.  Umm, but if you are corrupt and you and your buddies are planting drugs on people and then murdering them, how do you trust any of them?  Seems the only good plan is to frame them first. Lol, no... Weed is far safer than alcohol. Haha I meant because 2016 was bizarre but your joke was way better. there are few things I hate more than people who kill their captive and then still try to get the ransom and lie that they are alive still. have some fucking kidnapper honor.  I must be behind on the Duterte dirt. When did he admit to raping somebody? I know he made that incredibly distasteful and offensive comment about the Australian missionary lady who was raped (not by him), but I don't remember hearing about him admitting to doing a little raping himself. Inhaling weed. He can't exactly claim good character for simply being an enabler of bad behaviour he was expecting. He didn't know which cops in particular were corrupt and he couldn't use the army directly. I think he accepted ""collateral damage"" which sounds heartless but his argument would be that the situation is already horrific in Philippines with drug corruption (probably with US involvement) and at least this way an end was in sight.  Regardless, am glad I live in Australia and not Philippines. Inconceivable... You keep using that word. I don't think it means what you think it means. I might've gotten them mixed up with the NBI the other guy mentioned, I thought it was one of the national agencies. I've been reading up a little on the Philippines lately but I'll gladly defer to somebody who actually knows what they're talking about.  It should be noted that they voted far less favorably.  >215 (96.4%) of 223 Republican Representatives voted for the resolution.  >82 (39.2%) of 209 Democratic Representatives voted for the resolution.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Resolution#cite_note-Senate_Roll_call-10 You can implicate Democrats far easier. Democrats are really good at defacto wars. "" Police action"" they pulled on Lybia. Police action Obama threatened over wmds and caved under pressure of the people.  Lybia is even less stable then Iraq. They didn't even have decency to try and do the right thing and ensure a peacefully install of democracy. Yes.  Thank God you came when you did.  I almost sullied the reputation of the Grand Old Party.  Yes,  I meant, don't billionaires and the millionaires who want to be them want oil there or something? To be clear, the PNP chief is the one saying they will pause it - as he has been given orders by the President to form a new body to crack down on Police corruption, and on the same day the President said that the drug war will last till the end of his term. They do this all the time and has already become a meme - they always release contradicting press releases and miscommunication within the Admin.  Must be getting ready to send in waves of reinforcements or something. It's almost like the French state of emergency or the Franco/Belgian/Dutch limited time of military presence on the streets. It doesn't end, whether it's far right or comes from the center... Especially when you throw in Schindler's List into the ending for no reason. I feel like I've seen this in a movie. very scary. I made the Exodus!    You wanna remove all the comments you've ever made on reddit, and overwrite them with a message like this one?    Easy!

If trumps wrong we can all laugh in his face. Fuck off Reminder that David Brock is pumping 40 million dollars into astroturfing social media, reddit and the like  Yea you know just like that. All those thousands of Muslims we've killed here since Trump was voted into office. [Putin asked to see it and kept it.](http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/patriots-robert-kraft-vladimir-putin-stole-my-super-bowl-ring/) Found [it](https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3182/2564193877_06cc54b864.jpg) I just imagine dick Cheney as smeagol in a loincloth searching for the ring.  Donald dropped it in the sink while trying to put it on. His tiny fingers were to small. I-495? Keep it secret  *keep it safe* And yet it is still nowhere near as crazy as any of the things I mentioned.  Didn't say Trump wasn't crazy.. Source on those numbers or do you just read the opinion articles and move on? I'll believe it when I see it - Extrajudicial murder is still light years past anything he has actually effectively done as of yet.  A bunch of red-meat executive orders with no teeth (i.e. congressional appropriations and/or judicial clearance) to fellate his base don't quite rise to that level.  Plus to his credit he hasn't called another world leader a ""son of a whore"" yet... I mean, even that would still not be as crazy as literal death squads.    The highest reaches of crazy world leader are extremely competitive.   How about you say it when it actually happens instead talking out of your ass   Lol alright have an upvote after all. Al-Bashir, Kenyatta, Gbagbo, Charles Taylor, Ble Goude...should I continue?    Edit: Will just put this here and move on:  http://www.euronews.com/2015/07/17/five-of-the-worlds-most-wanted-for-crimes-against-humanity Take me with you..  can I get whitelisted pls? Why kill him in the first place? https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/world/asia/philippines-police-south-korean-killing.html?_r=0 Or maybe he doesn't care if people think he's popular, he's just a rebel.  It also says the government's principal goal has been to reduce the drug-related violence.  Homicides from organized crime have gone from 62 in 2006 to around 20,000 a year   Nope, death toll was below 100 when the military got involved in 2006  Wtf are you talking about. The whole war on drugs is the Americans idea I am unaware of the DDR purging stasi ranks to keep the stasi in line. He didn't.  It is, but clearly it's not incriminating enough to convict him or get him out of office. This type of bracktracking happens when someone has a means of removing you from power.  Yes, he's right. The wife of the kidnapped/and killed Korean actually went to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) for help because she knew her husband was under police custody. The NBI is a separate body, is usually more reliable and likely less corrupt than the PNP. They're basically better paid lawyer-cops.   In fairly recent news, regarding the rubout/murder of detained major drug suspect Espinosa by (CIDG agents/cops who were trying to serve him a warrant - inside his jail cell at 4am) right inside Bilibid Prison, All police reports for the Senate inquiry said that there was no foul play and that the prisoner Espinosa attempted to steal a firearm and was therefore shot because of it (inside his jail cell, mind you). Many suspected it was obviously an assassination that was covered up. Duterte and PNP chief De la Rosa later reinstated the CIDG cop who killed Espinosa.  But the NBI didn't take the side of the Administration and PNP by publishing a report for the Senate Inquiry stating that the killing of Espinosa was indeed a rubout/assassination according to their independent investigation.  no problem, glad to help I honestly hope the people who downvoted me noticed the sarcasm. Didn't think I needed the /s for this one. He should start internment camps for all leftists.   Here's some fact checking on the comparison between the 2 refugee bans, in case anyone cares about details or nuance.   http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/30/donald-trump/why-comparing-trumps-and-obamas-immigration-restri/ Unless I'm reading the article wrong Obama and the DHS under his term didn't ban people entering from those countries but rather targeted them for stricter vetting. Although this would result in more people being denied entrance it's still not a straight up ban.  Unless I'm reading the article wrong Obama and the DHS under his term didn't ban people entering from those countries but rather targeted them for stricter vetting. Although this would result in more people being denied entrance it's still not a straight up ban.  I think the first article is right about the selection of countries. I don't think one could say Trump's targeting Muslims, after all he's left a lot of Muslim majority countries of that list.  But the types of restrictions are very different. Obama exposed them to stricter vetting, not a blanket ban.  The fact that ""Obama Muslim ban"" returns some results doesn't mean anything substantial and is indicative of nothing more than the fact that some people labelled his actions as such.      underrated comment ""I put my hand out and Putin put it in his pocket, and three KGB guys got around him and walked out."" Oh my god that's priceless. Yeah, that was fucked up shit. They're all insane old men. Time for a new generation like Trudeau. lol, [reminds me of this Simpsons episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0hTrnaa8aE) :D  He really doesnt give a fuck, its hilarious. This is just funny. That's an alternative ring. who is gollum then! > That is over two billion dollars in brokerage.  Where are you getting those numbers? Because from what I'm seeing it would be more like ~$350M. Page 30 item #2:  https://www.pdf-archive.com/2017/01/11/trump-intelligence-allegations-searchable/trump-intelligence-allegations-searchable.pdf They're literally linked in the article bruh. If clicking underlined hyperlinks is too difficult for you, I'm afraid there's probably not much hope for you. The immigration order was by no standards toothless.  Only one of those is an African leader, the others are either in court, in prison or dead.  Might as well say Mladic, Radovan Karadzic, Hitler, etc Current leaders as per your comment numbnuts. I could name lots of European dictators who where once in power also. If you actually read the article, it says they killed him at the station, then ransomed. Well in OP, they state the order is that he was killed, then ransomed. Wikipedia backs up that claim, though better sources can probably be found.  Maybe he's gay and this was all a distraction Having heavily armed gangs in regional control does that. The issues are certainly drug-related, but that doesn't mean it's about drugs directly.  Long term solution perhaps? I still remember back in 2004 when we were planning an overland drive from Texas to Mexico City, it seemed safe then.. no way I'd try that now. They did it to the populace. Neighbor v neighbor. Co-worker v co-worker.  You really do. There are more than plenty of people who actually believe that. Oh yeah, people totally got it. You might not - Trump is anything but predictable. It's not impossible that he goes full retard as he learns that the President is not a dictator.  He will probably go crazy with executive orders.    But nobody ever dare liken him to Hitler!  kinda like Trudeau, he is too scared to stand up to anything If nothing else, he looks better with his shirt off. trudeau is a wet, limp noodle. he's not a good pm Maybe if Putin didn't have an army of spooks and goons to enforce his shitty behavior. That dude doesn't do whatever he wants because he has balls, he does it because he can have his opposition killed. ""Wannabe alpha male, with the insane way Putin cares so much about being portrayed as macho and manly I wouldn't be surprised at all by now if he's actually gay. Stealing! So alpha! /s It only shows Putin is a kleptocrat. duh ;) http://www.joemygod.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ConwayInsults-660x330.jpg Also him, he's up his own ass To the meat of the issue - the comparison.  Toothless or not is irrelevant.  No one has been murdered by official presidential decree.  To your tangent, I repeat  >(i.e. congressional appropriations and/or judicial clearance)  The judiciary has intervened very rapidly.  Please don't interpret this as an endorsement, I am merely pointing out the fact.  We still do have checks and balances.   A simple Google search will net you several currently in power.  I don't have the time or I would school you properly on this...you are saying that only one current African leader is committing crimes against humanity, right? One of those is a current leader.  I could spend the 10 seconds searching the Google on the Internet machine to find you only African world leaders CURRENTLY in power as opposed to those JUST removed from power but you can do that yourself...you are a big boy/girl. And not just a normal police station, it was right inside the compound of Phil. National Police Headquarters, a few hundred meters away from the National Police Chief's office.  A VERY elaborate rouze  You are absolutely correct. These organizations have far more enerprises than drugs. Like for example cartels Control the majority of the tried of avacado, lime, and agave and needless to say these aren't reputable business men forming companies. If drugs are no longer profitable they will just move into another industry. you mean like Obama did?  No, didn't he elbow that elderly woman in the face during some sort of parliamentary squabble? Now I can never unsee. Name three. So you can only come up with one. He asked for three, you said plenty.  I think you just have an anti Africa bias. No, a  very Fabulous rouse [Here's the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZQeDGaSCP4).  The NDP were preventing a conservative from sitting down and delaying a vote, so he went over there to break up the school yard tactics and she accidentally took an elbow.     http://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2012/02/09/the-five-worst-leaders-in-africa/#4c444ec35516 Lol.  Will just put this here and shut you up pretty hard:  http://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2012/02/09/the-five-worst-leaders-in-africa/#4c444ec35516  You can think what you want...I don't, but you can think I do.  I think you are just a troll.  You can't even infer an anti Africa bias from anything I said.  I said there were way worse than Trump and then I accurately listed a bunch of countries and continents with worse issues.  I didn't say it was BECAUSE they were African...just that there are horrible, brutal dictators all over Africa.  That is a correct statement and has been for a hundred years at least. You said plenty slaughtering their own people, these are the top five shitty leaders, one is slaughtering his own people, two could be argued could be neglecting the populous to the extreme it could create bad enough living conditions that they might not make median life expectancy. But no, not slaughtering.  You hve still provided one example, I asked for three.  If it's plenty, you should not be having trouble with this.  Three examples please or retract you false claim.

"34",33,"5r0066","2017-01-30","""Populist gesture""   It's not in the BBC article anywhere.   From Telegraph:  >However, a Downing Street source has told the BBC that cancelling the trip would be ""populist gesture"" and ""undo everything"" achieved by Theresa May during her trip to the US last week.  They also had a petition to close all borders and prevent all immigration until ISIS is defeated that was at 500,000 the last i checked. Petitions don't do shit ""Populist gesture ?""     Isn't that what got you into office Ya well gangman style has over 1 BILLION views. So there Petitions now seem like weak gestures, they've lost all credibility >""populist gesture""  You do have bad experiences with those after that whole Brexit thing right Miss May?   One million is considerable, when you take into account the general levels of engagement with these things. May has to allow for a debate if she's serious about 'the will of the people'. Ah I see.  Ignore the populace and dismiss the 1 million signatories (and increasing) as a populist gesture.    That's sure to go down well with your voter base who voted you into offi.... oh wait.  You haven't been voted into office. I just want a political leader to stand up and say that ignoring political relations with another country because you disagree with the views/actions of its leader is stupid and childish. I'm beginning to roll my eyes everytime I see a news story about a petition.  There's a petition for everything these days.  Having a petition for something is not notable, nor is having a lot of signatures on said petition. What does this achieve? I think it will just make the situation worse.  Probably smarter to run a country like a country and not a highschool. Yeah no one likes him, but you aren't dealing with him you are dealing with the US. You can't put the US on the back burner and come to it later. As much of a douchebag as he is, you need to you know, run your country. Sitting around saying someone is mean does fuck all for anyone but waste time and money. You won't change his mind by not talking to him. Simply get what you can and push against his ideals at every front you can but simply saying ""don't come here you're a jerk"" is a dumb fucking move and a childish one. Last week: reddit praising the Parliament for following its own laws  This week: reddit shitting on the Parliament for following its own laws US meat standards will kill more Brits than terrorists No doubt we'll find out in a week or so that the majority of them were made-up accounts on VPNs etc. Can I have a say in this? I'm Australian and the queen is still my monarch right? Britain is in the position of needing to renegotiate trade arrangements with virtually all partners: do you really want to piss off the head of state of a country that it is critical for you to maintain an equitable trade relationship with.  You hold your nose to deal with Trump, because it is ultimately better for the U.K. economy. Like leaving the EU was populist? I like how the phrase 'populist' becomes interchange with democracy, depending on your agenda.  No, Theresa.  Trumpxit means Trumpxit I'm no fan of Trump, but I don't really see what we have to gain by stopping him from coming into the country and talking to our Prime Minister? It would have been a stupid decision.  Around 400,000 of those signatures actually come from the UK.  Petitions like this are a waste of time for everybody and the news ought to know better than report on them.   The anti Brexit one had something like 50,000 signatures from the fucking Vatican... Thank god public policy isn't being dictated by lefty activist and their cause of the week.  Well the UK can always open their doors to immigrants then.  It's almost like the UK has millions of liberals or something.   Of course it's populist. The entire basis of our government is populist. To belittle populism is to belittle democracy, policing by consent, the legal system, everything we hold dear.   This is the language of facism. Huh, so is Brexit then not a populist gesture too? Tyranny of the majority!  It's an online petition, anyone can click a button and feel like they are making a change.   ""Populist gesture ?"" Isn't that what fueled Brexit? That's the worst idea ever to ban trump from visiting, you don't have to like the guy to realise how much the UK actually needs trade and a good relationship with the US. Populist gesture... you mean like Brexit?  Populist gesture?  What, like Brexit? Yes, let's all sign a petition that could potentially damage relations with the US government right after we damage relations with the rest of Europe. Yeah lets ban the one guy we need for a good trade deal. Its depressing the amount of braindead people there are Article says 30,000 signatures came outside the U.K.  That doesn't mean those people aren't citizens. The petition asked British citizens in the U.K. And abroad to sign it.  The more you isolate and segregate those who disagree with you the less influence you have on them to make them see things your way.  Honestly if you ever want Trump to do things differently shutting him out only makes it worse. That goes for anyone who has a different opinion from you - they'll just say fuck it and they'll go their own way without you. [Word cloud out of all the comments.](http://i.imgur.com/wZV2F7A.png)  I hope you like it Why would a vote for Brexit not be a populist gesture and this would be?  Theresa May really reminds me of Neville Chamberlain in her complete lack of diplomatic moral fortitude. Umm no.   Pandering to UKIP? Now *that's* a populist gesture. Especially when Farage was gearing for a second referendum in on of his very first tv appearances as the results became clear.  And now I'm a ""remoaner"" wanting referenda until I get the answer I want.  Hypocrites, the lot of them. And Brexit is a go through populist propaganda, ow the irony... So we cut ties from the EU and now people don't want us to further trade negotiations? Talk about economic suicide... Ironic, while I don't agree with the petition, she herself is only in power because of the 'populist gesture' of the brexit.  Same people signed the petition to retake brexit vote.  This is retarded, trust me good relationships with the US only benefits you fools and I'm from the UK myself!  You must be so used to politicians lying and cheating that you're getting upset that he's keeping his word!   He activated BOSS mode and you all losing your shit! So let me get this straight, you don't want someone entering your borders because you don't agree with his world views and you deem him a danger to your country?   Goddamn xenophobes. They can't stop the Trump Train. It has no brakes! 59 million have not signed it. You know what got more votes than this?  The Brexit vote. And Trump will go down as a President who wasn't able to accomplish anything, not because he was incapable but because people discriminated against him based on their own prejudices and biases. And his type will be elected again, because he won't be able to set a negative example for his type of leader.  In short, fight what he does or tries to do, if it's bad. Don't just fight him because you don't like him. petitions are as useless as protests are Let's put this in perspective.  1 million people signed - no way to know if all signers were UK residents or bitter American libertards. Benefit of the doubt, let's say all 1 million are UK citizens. There are currently ~64 million people in the UK.  That means 1.56% of the population signed the petition (again assuming 100% of signers are in the UK). That means 98.4% of the population either doesn't give a flying fuck or supports Trump's state visit. 1 million is a large number, until taken in correct context with the total population. Nobody cares what those who signed the petition think! This is a stupid idea really. The POTUS is being invited, this just happens to be Trump. Theresa May is in an impossible situation, leaving the EU is one thing, fucking off the POTUS is another. She is not wrong. On the other hand so was Trump's election and Brexit itself, so I don't know how she can ""dismiss"" populism when her very being PM is a result of it.  Moreover I think that her attitude of being Trump's lapdog is even worse. Do they honestly believe that President Trump gives any fucks? The level of emotional delusion with these people.  Just when the UK is going to need as much goodwill as possible after brexit, they're willing to damage relations with their biggest ally.      It's the same with liberals in the US.  It's like they are willing to watch everything burn the fuck down, simply because they didn't get their way. > It states: ""Donald Trump s**hould be allowed to enter the UK in his capacity as head of the US Government**, but he should not be invited to make an official State Visit because it would cause embarrassment to Her Majesty the Queen.""  Basically, this petition is more about the embarrassment to the Queen than Donald Trump or his actions. So what about the millions and millions of others that do want Trump to visit? How many of those signatures are actually from British citizens or UK residents?  Honest question from this US citizen...does the UK protest? I mean, I know you can and do but is this something that would get folks worked up? Maybe if it hit 2 or 10 million? Just wondering what gets folk out onto the streets across the big water. Despite her hypocrisy, I find myself, for the first time agreeing with her.  Brb cutting wrists.  too many hysteric panicking alt-left here on reddit past few days the same stupid petition in world news? Petitions don't do shit What about the 63 million that *didn't* sign it? I feel like the Queen is actually one of the few people in the world who legitimately could sit him down and give him a stern talking to about being such a man child. All this Trump hate is ridiculous. Some of his ideas are dumb, but so far they have all made sense. Execution has been off but he's been in office two weeks. Wish everyone would calm down. Want a good example of it all being blown out of proportion?   Russia. Where did all that go? Three weeks ago Trump was in their pocket and Russia was coming to get America, but now, where is it? No one cares cause there was nothing there to begin with. Calm down, ffs people You can get 1 million people to sign a petition saying the sky is orange.  Mob mentality is a thing. What people here are missing is that yes, these petitions themselves are always batted away, but that's not the point. The public do not expect a parliamentary turnaround but they do expect, by signing so quickly that the subject will be noticed, reported on and brought to the eyes of the government on a broader stage. The media now holds them to account on a subject they would not have considered or wanted to discuss, which is why these things work. It's not about direct success, but the causing of discomfort and having a voice heard. Another god damn online petition. So pointless.  well... at least he'll know what a million people looks like when they come to protest him :p US President Donald Trump's UK state visit has gathered more than a million signatures. If Miss May called off the meeting, then what message would that send to Trump? People dislike his policies, but in government you always have to meet with people you dislike I looked at the JSON format and usually on these petitions you see people from all over the world signing them but the number of people from Britain itself is a staggering 1257830.  It also turns out that almost 6.5k US citizens also agree that he should meet the queen.  Personally I believe it to not be a valid reason for not letting him meet the queen but I am all for democracy so if it is passed then so be it, I will support the choice of the people and parliament.   **Edit**: I am British, English FYI Well agreed, this is how the twitter-generation fights, by acting like fucking children and signing shit on the internet. OMG, here we go! When the leader of a country like England calls a 1,000,000 signature petition a 'populist gesture', shit is going to happen. I love how everything negative Trump does gets upvoted to high heaven but yet you see nothing about the safezones he and the Saudi King agreed on. r/politics2 It's all about the Lizzies and the Benjamins, my friends. Theresa may: do as I say and not as I do. What is the point of democracy if no one listens to the people? Was it really 1m though?  Will of the people Theresa, will of the people.  If anyone thought they weren't having a meeting they were kidding themselves.   1,310,496 Oh my god she doesn't even see the irony The old bat is all in favour of populism when it's via the Mail or The Sun... Online petition is a populist gesture.... no shit Sherlock that's why the government created it. Trump banned Muslims from America The Citizens banned Orange People from UK So if it was actually canceled he gets blamed for ruining relations with 1 of our closest allies. People are fucking dumb.  Death my Petition. Everyone and their pathetic desire to take a jab at Trump. So Londistan wants to ban Trump...who would have thought.  Britain is already dead. What if we give you New York? Would you keep him?  If Adolf Hitler was here today, They'd send a limousine anyway Wow. The vitriol in the BBC comments section is just...very discomforting. I used to live in the UK. I'm not Muslim, but was often grouped into the 'category' due to my skin colour and the possibility that there were certain people with nothing but absolute contempt and hate for me for no reason whatsoever just makes me shudder. Yes, deny the president of America a trip to your country because your butthurt population doesn't like him, this surely wouldn't hurt relations. wasn't Brexit populist? I think it would actually be better to have his visit plagued with peaceful protests that never let up.  His presidency will be remembered for how much civil unrest it caused.  This is so stupid. You can get 20mil Anti-Trumpers to sign anything right now.  I'm not Pro-Trump, but this is stupid.  Maybe we should start a petition to stop brexit..  Or for an unbiased news channel?  Are all these signatures authenticated as individuals and all UK citizens?  A nation can't be ruled by anonymous petitions on the internet which are subject to hacking or multiple votes, not to mention that it would be suicidal for the PM to ban the POTUS from the UK when we're about to go into negotiations for a trade deal A country of lemmings. Anyone from over the world can sign it.  This is why the BBC is left wing shit tier propaganda.  This is a country not a school ran by babies. Let the two engage on talks and sort things out. [removed] She did the right thing by meeting with him, there is much more involved to the relationship than Trump. Liberal lefties is the new populism  Expect gold OP. Anything anti trump gets gold nowadays! Congrats!  He wants to resume ruining the Scottish coast for his golf course right? there was a doco on it clearly, people were bribed.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_hisXNDZkY its gonna be a long four years   Trumps administration shows a lack of professionalism. Trump jumps into actions that were not legally and intellectually considered.  It is almost like the president is a reality show host and does not not know how to do the job. There are plenty of legal experts that can be reached before actions like this are done. But Trump talks to media pros ,like Bannon instead.      But Trump has a great accomplishment. We had a global warming problem until Jan. 20. Now it is gone. The problem with petitions like this is that you don't hear the people who are against it. What happens if one million people are for it, but 2 million are against it? You'd never hear about those 2 million especially if the BBC doesn't like the outcome. I wish we could sign a petition to have him face all the lawsuits he's railroading with all of his money.  ""populist gesture""  So the people want it? And that's why you say no? I'm starting to think peaceful protests and petitions are completely pointless, that's probably why they are allowed. Considering she's moving head first forward on a popularity vote, it's a little strange why she would reject populism in one instance but not another. If you guys are so pissed off, go protest on the day trump arrives to meet your queen. Even if 0.5% of the crowd that signed the petition shows up, it would be a great way to show strength This online petition was clearly hacked by the Russians.   cuz fuck democracy. Lol. The burn victims.  US does so much for the intelligence community that officials in Europe know not to fuck with Donald Trump. Maybe it is all a trick to Detain him in customs  I'm pretty sure British democracy was originally described as a ""populist gesture."" She considers her stance to be pragmatic - she can influence him for the good.  This isn't untrue.  The problem is her cozying up to Trump AND ERDOGAN seems an opportunistic grab for cards to use in the Brexit negotiations. > ""undo everything"" achieved by Theresa May during her trip to the US last week.  I'm not total against this.  Is she the next Chamberlain? They updated the article. Original here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/38788388 May must've gotten some warm fuzzies when Donnie clung to her hand to stay safe from those mean ol' stairs. Expect her to find the tallest flight in Britan to take him up. A tremendously amusing statement, as May accomplished absolutely fucking nothing during her trip. Unless you count looking like a browbeaten parasite incapable of answering a question directly  Brexit was a populist gesture as well. Can we please cancel that and while we are at it can we send a populist gesture to Theresa may with two fingers >  Petitions don't do shit  Hey, they got a digimon game localized! Not true at all.  The firefly petition I signed is gaining some momentum so we should expect a season 2 any day now. Petition to make petitions relevant and useful !  ! ! Only reason she's in the top seat is because all the others backed out; Last man standing.  ""No-one else wants this? I'll take it then""   ""k fam"" Well this populist gesture suggests it is OK for Trump entering the UK as the head of the US government.  > It states: ""**Donald Trump should be allowed to enter the UK in his capacity as head of the US Governmen**t, but he should not be invited to make an official State Visit because it would cause embarrassment to Her Majesty the Queen.""   As soon as I read the post title, I thought exactly the same.  The next thought was that this should belong to r/nottheonion. People have some funny idea that because we elect people to represent us they have to do everything we say.   That totally defeats the point of an elective democracy, if that were the case we'd just put every decision in the country to popular vote. That wouldn't work at all, people would vote for lower taxes and more benefits that just wouldn't make sense. Nobody would vote for long-term beneficial policies like debt reduction or investment that they won't see the benefit of.  In this case she's probably correct, making a short-term populist knee jerk gesture towards the leader of the free world is probably going to be worse for what's in the population's best interests in the long-term, even if they disagree with that. No vote was held for Theresa May or her policies. MFW we'd rather have Theresa May as our POTUS. That is EXACTLY how she got into office. https://imgflip.com/i/1imgsp Funnily enough, she opposed the populist gestures that has her in the position she is in; supporting them now. Hey guys, member Brexit? Nobody voted for Theresa as Prime Minister.. she just ended up holding the shitty end of the stick after Dave resigned. Gangman, haha It's actually closer to 3 billion. > they've lost all credibility  Anyone on the internet can sign it multiple times, why would you think that?  /s Mrs.* It's ridiculous. In the Brexit referendum the leave vote won by 1,269,501 and she's pushing ahead with that. At time of writing, the Trump petition has 1,315,002 signatures and she wants to dismiss that as a 'populist gesture'? It's not even calling for him to be banned from the UK (although that would be a beautiful irony), it's just asking that he not be given the full honours of a state visit (because no one wants Her Majesty the Queen to be grabbed by the pussy). But, looking at the latest news, the UK government has apparently dismissed the petition, despite the fact that any petitions gaining over 100,000 signatures are supposed to be properly debated in parliament. Mate EVERY petition has been rejected from gov.uk. Not one has been seriously considered and each of them have a condescending response that is akin to ""We know better than the rabble, so hush"".  EDIT: I mean technically speaking there's a few that have lead the way to discussion on certain topics. I don't think we should stop with our petitions but it is a fucking shame that they get all this coverage so we get potentially hundreds of thousands of non UK citizens skewering the vote. I was speaking with hyperbole because I was pissed off that the Snooper's Charter petition got snubbed immediately.    She's not, that's just a handy soundbite. In reality she is the woman who wants to [repeal the human rights act](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-speech-that-laid-out-plans-for-the-future-deleted-from-the-internet-a7137496.html) because it restricted the powers of the Government. > May  &  > the will of the people.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  May will pay attention to the 'will of the people' just as soon as she's finished telling them what it is. she'll have to debate it. This is going to be the only question she gets on every TV interview and press conference for the foreseeable future.   To my mind, the smart move is to let it be debated in the commons, then it's not her words, it's the opposition MPs that are causing a fuss.   > May has to allow for a debate if she's serious about 'the will of the people'.  Actually she doesn't.  It is a representative democracy.  She has the authority to make decisions until the next election.   Now if she pisses off enough people there may be a call for an election, but until then she doesn't have to give any credence to petitions.    Yes her opponents are pissed off.  But, the important thing to remember is that anyone who would have signed that petition would never have voted for her in the first place.   Like Trump she has learned that pissing off loud people, who will never vote for you under any circumstances, is much less important that keeping quiet people who will vote for you happy. I go onto the No 10 Petition site once in a blue moon, a similar petition was rejected when Cameron was leader. It said they don't debate on individual immigration or something like that, she's just using her statement to get attention I think because of the meeting.  One of the most recent ones I saw was a considerable number of people signing once opposed to the internet snooping act. Definitely over 10,000 people so that would call for a debate, I think over 100,000.  It was rejected because ""we have already debated it at length"" so, really they don't care what people think, the fact that these debates happened during the referendum made no difference. When would it have been a good time for that petition? When will the number of your debates mean it doesn't matter?  The most fishy part of it is say someone gets 5,000 signatures but theres a slightly similar and older petition (usually close to its deadline) they'll reject it at the eleventh hour and tell them to add to that one instead even if it's only had like 10 signatures. >  Ignore the populace and dismiss the 1 million signatories (and increasing) as a populist gesture.   Here's what the 1M signatures are for   > It states: ""Donald Trump should be allowed to enter the UK in his capacity as head of the US Government, but he should not be invited to make an official State Visit because it would cause embarrassment to Her Majesty the Queen.""  The petitioners are OK for Trump entering the UK as the head of the US government. It's a freakin' online petition. Do you have any idea how stupid you look when you give that sort of nonsense even a thought?! 1 Million people? Thats like 1/5th of Scotland. Nobody gives a shit about Scotland. Shouldn't we as a sentient species take this time to revisit our concept of governing? Because let's be honest, there's a shitload of unqualified twats and sociopaths somehow holding quite a lot of power over the vast majority of the population, pretty sure there's something wrong in the way we're handling things and the way the supposed failsafes aren't failing to keep us safe. I don't know, might just be me and all, but something seems wrong. Came here for this comment. Reddit can't honestly believe that making foreign policy off a petition is a good idea. You forget a populist vote just caused Brexit? So you want to cut off relations with the US now? Let me know how that works out. Especially when that political relationship is one of your strongest allies... So you didn't read the article...   The petition isn't to block Trump from visiting the UK (it says that Trump should not be blocked from coming), its to not give him the honor of a state visit, something that happens once or twice a year.  Unpopular opinion time:  In 6 months we'll see marches beginning to replace petitions.  Womens' March, Pride March, Tax March, even a March for Science for god sakes. All scheduled relatively close to each other. Give it time and these will end up converging into the same kind of disorganized slacktivist mess that Occupy Wall Street became. Also, I believe in all of these causes, but there needs to be more substance to these than pussy hats, ""Trump sux lol"" signs, and the mentality of ""Well that black guy held a march one time and it worked out well."" Yes, there could be a petition for anything. But not many petitions get 1m+ signatures. I think this is the second highest signed one in the government petition site history. So, by all means dismiss it, but do it on the correct grounds, not just because there are many other petitions. Exactly. I hate the outcome of everything that's happened, but since Palpatine wants to remove us from everything to to with the EU, we need Orange boy for the trade deal.  I'm can't wait until every country gives us the slimy, diseased, shit-covered end of the stick in every negotiation because we broke all our relationships and existing deals through this foolhardy vote. No kidding  It bothers me that I had to go this far down the thread to find this. It also bothers me how many people do not think about the consequences of their actions further than, ""he mean, I not like"". Not read it then? Has nothing to do with stopping him from visiting, just meeting the Queen.  Finally a sensible opinion, had a scroll way too far for this. Exactly! We can't just not deal with the leader of a global super power. All of the political rhetoric and protesting and propaganda and shenanigans really just boil down to one question:  ""Do I like the thing we're talking about?""  If the answer is yes, then it's *obviously* the paragon of democracy and freedom and wholesomeness and love and happiness.    If the answer is no, then *of course* it's pure fascism, racism, totalitarianism, and evil. Next week: reddit praising Parliament for not following its own laws  Week after: reddit shitting on Parliament for not following its own laws How is it shitting on parliament for following its own laws? Parliament isn't doing anything here, this is a petition. I sure am looking forward to our pathetic government back peddling on our consumer and worker protections as soon as the corporate bribes start coming in.  Explain? As far as I know, the US has had far less issues with our meat supply than the UK and EU.   I don't recall much unlabeled horse meat in US grocery stores, and I don't recall any Mad Cow in the US either. The USDA is actually on top of their shit food safety wise.   Now if you're just talking about clogged arteries down the line that's a different conversation. Fair enough. Like going to the store when the clerk is that one asshole you can't stand. Populist isn't by definition a negative term. It totally depends on the context. What we really need to know is whether this is a hard Trumpxit or a soft Trumpxit, a black Trumpxit or a white Trumpxit  No, we're going to have a Red, White, and Blue Trump. Makes a change from the orange one, at least. That was the vote, not some little petition. Suddenly people are for populism? Make up your minds. At time of writing the Trump petition has more signatures than the leave vote won by, yet she thinks the petition should be dismissed while she pushes for a hard Brexit... The idea of independence is somewhat damaged when we change our dependency to a different country, no? Exactly, and if you ban Trump you also have to ban the leaders who are worse than him. For example there are 77 countries where homosexuality is illegal, including 10 that execute them. How is it even acceptable for their leaders to meet the queen? Why don't people care about this? People signed this petition because they're intellectually lazy and just follow the social media herd. Pretty sure the people who will be on this march will not be the same people that voted for Brexit (in the main). > their biggest ally  Militarily, perhaps, but trade-wise the EU is a much bigger partner than the US.  >It's like they are willing to watch everything burn the fuck down,  No idea what you're saying here. Thats just a pretence, we can't just petition to keep him out for being a dick. I think the Queen is quite capable of deciding who she wants to meet herself.  It's a statement.  A state visit is a whole lot more than just visiting the country, it is a political and diplomatic move steeped in centuries of tradition and grandeur. Evidently a lot of people are unhappy about the idea of us celebrating Donald Trump and honouring his presence. We may have to work with him (ie inviting him to visit) - and however distasteful it is, we do have to work with him - but that doesn't mean we have to roll out the red carpet. It's a monday, the conservatives are at work Haven't you heard? Its cool to be left right now! hush now, 1.5% of the population has spoken, don't you get it? NOPE THE UK DOESN'T HAVE A CONSERVATIVE PARTY OR A CONSERVATIVE GOV'T STOP SHOUTING WE'RE ONLY FULL OF LIBERALS AND THIS PETITION OF 1 MILLION SPEAKS FOR THE OTHER 63 MILLION AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH The Iraq war protests were probably the biggest and most deflating to our democracy in my living memory. Since then protests are more ideologically driven such as tuition fee's (free college education). These are regular but never very large.  Probably the biggest and most unified protests since the Iraq war were the occupy movement protests before it got devided by ideologically driven extremists. But they were relatively small.  Just googled this and it turns out that the largest protest was actually the iraq war protest estimated between 750,000 and a two million.[^[1]](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2765041.stm) Bear in mind that a million people is over 1.5% of the UK population. [Yes we do!] (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/30/uk-protests-donald-trumps-travel-ban-happening/) But we tend to get a bit apathetic and stay indoors when it rains - which is on average [once every three days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_the_United_Kingdom#Rainfall). The biggest protest in British history was against the Iraq War and that was estimated at about one million people. The UK does not protest on the same level as the USA at all, you get the odd march but they seem to be an American fad that's coming in. The idea you could get ten million people out on the street in the UK is ridiculous, that's about 1/7 of the population. I was part of 40,000 people who marched through manchester after Cameron got elected. We protest shit all the time it just generally doesn't get attention unless it is violent, and that only gets bad attention. It's near impossible to affect the political sphere as an individual unless you devote your life to becoming a politician. He's gotten to be as old as he is while acting like a petulant child and being a generally terrible person and businessman. Nothing is going to change him. The media frenzy is hilarious isn't it?   Do it No, its not. sure 1,000,000 dont want him to meet the queen, but there is no way to know if more people than that DO want him to meet. its the main problem with petitions. What does this even mean?  Democracy is populist.  at least in a parliamentary democracy we can drop our premier. It's a perfect description for the Brexit referendum result  Isn't populist gesture also another name for Brexit? I mean sort of. It started out as a way for rich landowners not to be taxed out the ying yang for a stupid war with France, and not to be thrown in jail when they expressed displeasure with how the war was going. The peasants didn't really get involved for another few hundred years.  Also, a small aside but no king has been named John since the Magna Carta since John became synonymous with cowardice when he signed away some of his authority. Described, maybe. But the only people that could originally participate were nobles and gentry. Not the common people. The vast majority of the country was not allowed political rights. So that's not actually populist. I find it hilarious that one of her 'cards to use' is Turkey, even though Turkey joining the EU was one of the leave campaigns main points.  > This isn't untrue.  I mean. To whose wisdom *has* Trump bowed? The white nationalism of Bannon. Some people are saying Elon Musk, but I'm pretty sure that was just two billionaires exchanging courtesy pinkies up the bunghole.  At this point it seems increasingly clear that anyone who does not succeed in outright stopping Trump is getting dragged along on this lovely 21st century thrill ride. > an opportunistic grab for cards to use in the Brexit negotiations  if that's not her job, what is her job? It would be something that hurt the UK's position with the US and mostly appeased people who don't like her or her government anyway.  Desperate measures  Can you guys ban Teresa May too while you're at it? Don't insult Chamberlain that way. He was a diligent, widely respected and competent leader in his day, just on the wrong side of a few key issues, but still willing to compromise and try to find solutions.   Theresa May is just a spineless hack screwing over everyone she can.  Which digimon game? Why are we not discussing more important issues like this? *and* Dark Souls on PC! don't forget star trek TOS! Please expand on this! But that made sense. Holy shit. What? Link. I just watched season one last week. It's pretty interesting actually. I like it and will sign this shit.  Nah she cut a deal with Boris at least. There's no way he'd be in the position he's in now if Theresa made it without making a deal.  Worked out relatively well for her in the end though, since it looks like Labour aren't planning on contesting at least the next election. That's actually something I respect. It's how you end up with a real leader and not a limp wrist politician who will say anything and do nothing.  Similar to Obama being elected to the Senate *""Last man standing""*  *Dies*  *""Round over. Game over.""*  Last man standing? She was clearly going to win - the others didn't back out, they gave it to her because if it had gone to the Tory party vote the others, Leadsom in particular, would have been put through an industrial meat grinder. She was going to win, they cut to the chase. As an American who finds monarchy vaguely distasteful, let me say that your Queen has too much respect and dignity to be seen hanging around our pigheaded President. To be fair. Many people complain about trump being a populist president and the rise of populism.   They at least should be happy that May rejected populism for a change. Right? What was the populist gesture that got her into office? > People have some funny idea that because we elect people to represent us they have to do everything we say.  That's exactly what's happening with Brexit.   > the leader of the free world  That isn't a permanent title to the US President.   There doesn't seem to be much world leadership coming from DC in the past week. It's the politicians who only think of the short term. Because they have to be put to the vote every four years.   That is the biggest failure of politics.  People still don't do those things in representative democracy  Which is over 1 billion.  So there. [removed] > despite the fact that any petitions gaining over 100,000 signatures are supposed to be properly debated in parliament.  Actually they're only considered for debate. That loophole exists exactly  so the government can dismiss what it wants to dismiss. > It's ridiculous. In the Brexit referendum the leave vote won by 1,269,501 and she's pushing ahead with that. At time of writing, the Trump petition has 1,315,002 signatures and she wants to dismiss that as a 'populist gesture'?  K hold on. Those are not the same thing.  To win a vote by a margin is not the same thing as counting how many people support something.  So 1,200,000 MORE people voted for Brexit.  And 1,300,000 TOTAL people signed this petition. How many are against this petition? If we had that number, maybe we could compare this to Brexit.  As it stands, your comparison is not useful.  >In the Brexit referendum the leave vote won by 1,269,501 and she's pushing ahead with that. At time of writing, the Trump petition has 1,315,002 signatures and she wants to dismiss that as a 'populist gesture'?   /r/badmath That's a stupid comparison, 17,410,742 people voted to leave the EU. While, as you say, 1,315,002 have signed a petition to stop the visit. Just because you dislike the Brexit vote doesn't mean this comparison of yours has any validity. completely incomparable, and you just make yourself look stupid by even attempting to compare them.  you're seriously comparing a turnout in the referendum that was the largest turnout in modern history in the UK, with what is less than 3% of the turnout in unconfirmed signitures on a petition Looking at you decriminalise cannabis petition. The government pleases only themselves! The Hillsborough petition lead to the setup of the Hillsborough Independent Panel, and all that followed:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_disaster#Hillsborough_Independent_Panel  Also, any petition on any contentious issue will be batted away by the government. They're not going to hold up their hands and say ""fuck me you're right I'll reverse my policy"", it would make them look weak and unprincipled. But, these things (along with everything else that goes on) clearly does put pressure on the government. For instance, the Lansley NHS privatization bill was watered down significantly, you can't point to one petition, march, article, public comment, or speech in Parliament that lead to it, it all adds up to a political climate within which decisions are going to be made. Effectively it alters the political cost for pursuing different paths, and that does alter which path is chosen.   In this case, there's no way that Theresa May will actually agree to the petition and cancel a state visit (and although I dislike Trump that would indeed be a stupid thing to do), but the pressure from the last day or two will likely change the tone of the visit i.e. no golden carriages with Donald waving next to the Queen, more like a private meeting with limited video released to the press. That pressure isn't solely down to this petition, but it is part of it, alongside, for instance, [Sir Mo Farah's comments](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/uk/mo-farah-queen-made-me-a-knight-trump-made-me-an-alien-1.2955566) today, or the comments from the Muslim Conservative MP.  > Mate EVERY petition has been rejected from gov.uk  Mate, that's just not true.  Of the petitions in this parliament which reached the 100,000 signature threshold after which they say they will consider having a parliamentary debate:  * [14 weren't debated in parliament](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions?state=not_debated);  * [46 have been](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions?state=debated);  * [6 are awaiting a debate](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions?state=awaiting_debate).  However, I think they usually reject the crunchy ones, and this is definitely one of them. I always wondered when people suddenly decided petitions actually mattered? Like I'm seeing all these petitions being made and people actually think the government and companies will follow through if you get enough signatures. The accept refugees last year prompted the government to start the syrian refugee program.   If you remember that was a public reaction to the dead boy on the Turkish beach.   There was a stop all immigrants petition shortly afterwards which got several hundred thousand.   http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11846142/accept-more-refugees-crisis-petition.html Luckily we ate still protected by all the EU's human rights laws. Oh wait Britain is not as disparate as America. The last three decades of elections show us that the centre is essential to winning an election. There was barely a cigarette paper between the positioning of the two parties at the last election.  The reason she can ignore the outraged is because there is no strong, coherent opposition.  My constiuency is mildly conservative. Safe-ish. I'm centre-to-centre-left. Progressive. Voted Labour last election, remain. But because of my distrust for Corbyn, Saemus Milne and Len McClusky, I don't think I could do the same this time.  I liked that she got him to commit to NATO. But am terrified and disgusted at her cozying up to Trump AND Erdogan. So I signed.  The Queen has met Robert Mugabe and Idi Amin amongst others, and it is widely reported that she enjoys meeting controversial figures.  Did you see the list of other petitions?  500,000 signatures to deny Trump entry to the UK at all.  If I understand their rules, parliament has to consider that one as well.  EDIT:  It's not active.  It was pre-election.  But too bad it didn't get any action. What is the difference between a visit as the head of a government and an official State Visit? Those seem synonymous to me. Yes it's a petition, you're absolutely right.  We have tons of them here - and 99.9% are absolute chaff.  It's also highly likely that this petition will be ignored too as it's just a mechanism for securing time in Parliament for debate - and even then it's discretionary.    The point is that petitions are a way of allowing people who are pissed off to make a statement, which can in turn getting headlines and prompting open discussion - i think this is working pretty much to plan.  This petition however has gained a 1 million signatures in 24 hours which even in the laid back UK has to be something that can't be ignored. A politician would have to be an idiot to ignore the mood here and the statement that the petition sends.  Ignore the public at your peril. It's precisely as legally binding as the brexit referendum... This train of thought always bugs me, what makes it so much more ridiculous than a person going door to door to get signatures? And specially when after Brexit they need the special relationship with the US more than ever... thing is, these ""marches"" and ""rallies"" (I put them in quotes because some like the women's march are absolutely that, but many others are like you said, unorganized slacktivsits with some illegal rioting tossed in) help trump. The man isn't an idiot and knows how to negotaite, he wrote a fucking book on how he does deals and gets things done, and is doing it plain in the open.   He knows that any immigration plan will have to fall somewhere in the middle, meanwhile, espically with this though there are two extremes. He's got the right wing who will only be happy with a total permanent ban super selective ban anyone they don't like who might vote democrat, and on the left you've got guys who will only be happy with 100% open borders, amnesty for all, no deportations, nonevent can vote, etc.   Now the real fight comes in finding a middle ground, the left will always want him to go farther their way as will the right. With these large protests and riots it helps trump placate the right. He can come back to them after a month of unrest and say ""look, I tried the far right, ban 'em all nuclear option and the country just isn't accepting it, I need to tone it down to stop the unrest"", at the same time the left will be happy with anything in the middle. Hes negotiating from a position of strength.   It's like if you want to buy a large building. It's listed for $20 million, but you know you can probably get it for say $15 million and are willing to pay. How do you offer though, you don't walk in and say ""I'll offer $15million"" because then the sellers come back with 17.5 or something, and sooner or later you end up paying a little more. So you come in with some super low ball offer and work towards the middle. It's what Trump's done for decades, people I know from my time workign in NYC, who have done business with trump or his companies are not shocked at all, going all the way back to the ""build a wall because mexico is sending all their criminals here"", it's just what he does. Make a huge bombastic statement that will get everyone fired up, demanding him to change, and he will walk it back to the middle and those opposed will think they did some great deal, when in the end he's where he wanted to be anywhere.  Look at the F-35. Comes out saying it's way overbudget and we could replace the thing with newer updates to our F-18's. Anyone who has any shred of knowledge about aerospace was laughing their ass off, and of course trump knows you aren't replacing a 5th gen stealth fighter that's almost ready for full production with a two decade old plane. What happens this morning, trump sits down with LMT, and they find a way to remove about $600million from the production costs, and we get the same product we want anyway.  Air force one, same thing, of course he's not going to cancel the fucking plane and start flying a king air around or something, but makes a big statement and then get back to the middle.   I'm not taking a side, but it's what he does, always has done and will continue to do. It's shitty that this is the way it has to be done, but it's the system the left and right have created over the past decade, you can't come to the table with something resonable. If elizabeth warren wants to introduce a new tax policy, and leads with anything less than ""90% tax for the 1%"" rhetoric, then her own party tears her apart, at the same time if she comes in with a resonable proposal the republicans are going to frame it still has a far left libtard crazy policy and demand it go further right. Start far away and work to the middle.  Well if it turns into occupy wall street again then no one has anything to worry about. They'll get tired and move on eventually  Non-UK citizens can sign it. As soon as it goes viral (it already has) more and more chucklefucks are going to sign it to make it bigger.      Petitions mean literally nothing unless you can prove all signatures are legitimate - then you can judge numbers from them. 1M signatures from around the world is not as impressive. I'm not looking forward to finding out exactly how many of my neighbor's and friend's jobs are related to free trade.  If Trump tears up NAFTA and makes good on his threat to leave the WTO I could see a lot of people being surprised to learn that their job is reliant on free trade directly or indirectly.   Just Reddit displaying, once again, what its core demographic consists of.  Petulant children. It's petty as fuck. The UK need to keep their relations with the US on good terms, especially since the EU isn't very fond of them, at the moment. I think it's wise for May to take this one on the chin and do her best to play this petition down. I'm sure insulting him with this moronic petition will really keep him in a good mood to make deals with UK. I imagine you aren't British and don't care about our country, but slapping the president of our closest ally in the face does us no favours.  Don't you think she has a right to decide for herself who she will or will not see? Still childish.   Well, he can visit, but he can't meet our special person... Yup executive orders: abused by Bush, abused by Obama, now abused by Trump.  Reaction to them, hated/praised based on who is in office.  supreme court interventions: decried as judicial activism or praised based on the specific ruling.  government surveillance:  horrible since Bush and continued under Obama.  Criticized only by the party not in power at the moment, though supported in Congress by all.  Sexual harassment/etc:  Bill Clinton and Trump, need I say more?  Either boys being boys or a distraction from real issues depending on which party you're in.  People will tolerate any kind of misbehavior imaginable as long as it is done by the guy who is in their tribe. The horse meat scandal was a scandal because it was illegal (passing it off as another meat, the French love a bit of pony but it must be labeled as such).   Mad Cow (or BSE) is much rarer only 4 cases.   http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/ComplianceEnforcement/BovineSpongiformEncephalopathy/ucm2006517.htm  But, the problem with US meat is certain stuff is legal over there which isn't this side of the pond for good reason such as:  ""Eighty-two pesticides are banned in the EU on health and environmental grounds  but not in the US. Among these 82 pesticides are permethrin, the broad spectrum insecticide that is classed as a likely carcinogen and suspected endocrine disruptor, and atrazine, a herbicide thought to affect the immune system, which has also been linked to birth defects.""  https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/29/britain-us-trade-deal-gm-food-eu-rules  Write to your Congressman!  Nothing wrong with a tasty bit of horse.  AFAIK the EU has stricter regulations than the US in regards to hormones/drugs given to cattle and other livestock. It is not the actual supply what is the problem. The US farmers and companies do some pretty unethical and, well, unsanitary, plain cruel and food quality degrading act (to keep the price as down as possible). If the UK accept the trade deal it could mean we have to accept the lower-grade regulations as well (to make possible the goods from the US arrive here). Which could result in some company using the same unsanitary methods to create lower quality, cheaper meat and food, which will inevitably become widely used as other farmers will want to battle with the lower prices.     This is not 100% happening, but it could happen and if we open the door to lower regulations it most likely will result in lower quality foodstuff. And if there is a lot of lower quality food than what we eat now will get pricier as they will get to use the ""organic"" and ""British made"" tags - and it is ALWAYS cost more to buy.      (And btw, horse meat is pretty costly, and taste wonderful I eaten horse sausages and stew from horse meat. It is clearly not the cheap kind of meat.) It's just definitely orange It's a soft one. The petition states that they're fine with Trump entering the UK as the head of the US, but only want to bar his entry if he is coming as a state visitor. It's a redwhiteandblue Trumpxit! Ha! Consistency is for fascists! Both are only advisory to parliament prompting them to discuss it You have hit the nail on the head my good Sir! And they got their feelings hurt so they feel powerful acting like pouty children  Exactly.  Regardless of how you voted, Brexit is the reality now.  And instead of trying to deal with it going forward, the people who voted remain are willing to damage relations with their greatest ally, just to make an emotional statement which would have absolutely no beneficial value.    OOHH SHIT SON >now Oh God. Is Trump popular in the U.K.? You realise the UK conservative party is slightly left wing of the US Democratic party, right? Its followers can pretty easily be against Trump. It is. I get Trump is polarizing and I understand how it all looks, but I am staggered by the misinformation and hate.  Let's not show the facts and let people decide, let's fear monger and see if we can cause more problems. Statistically speaking, if that many were mobilized within that short of a timeframe to express their disapproval, you can be reasonably certain that there's a whole shit load more who are opposed to Trump's visit. It's only populist when the other side does it. We on the other hand don't care what people think. No wait... > Democracy is populist.  That's not strictly speaking true, as populist means representing 'ordinary' people (how-ever you define that). A democracy does not represent exclusively 'ordinary' people.  Even so, I wish we would use the word 'demagoguery' instead of mis-using the word populism to be inherently negative. To an extent. Democracy is also built on the precept that after the election the government gets to do its job. Short of impeachment-like procedures anyway. There's something to be said about not bending to every whim of the public while in power. (just speaking generally, not on the matter at hand) Brexit: ""Will of the people""  This: ""No... this is populist."" And by signing an agreement with them they are going to want to ease rules on immigration from Turkey. Well, she got him to publicly affirm NATO.  I want to get off Mr Oranges wild ride Ensuring the continued health/dignity of parliamentary democracy, the stability of the nation. Which is not served by affirming leaders of who are - in different ways - abusing office in a most undemocratic manner. When she was Home Secretary she tried to ban porn on the Internet and that didn't go very well. Cyber sleuth I think? Digimon 2: Electric Boogaloo Why do I have to go to Reddit to see this news? If corporate news wasn't publishing propaganda all the time, we could get to the real issues facing America Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth Guys, should we tell him? Oh you poor soul. That's an internet joke, like Half-Life 3. Firefly isn't coming back :/ :/ It's a fall guy position, however was PM after Cameron was left in such a shit position no one in there right mind wanted it.                      For whatever reason May took the role.             As Boris has back stabbed Cameron and was a big part of the reason Leave won, she put him in full public view for a job he is really, really can't do and shouldn't have.             If Boris manages to pull it off she gets credit, if Boris fucks up it was his fault alone and will swing public opinion against Boris and Leave. Boris has, inexplicably, a lot of party support. She needed to provide him with a position of significance to keep his faction under control. She gave him a powerful significant job knowing that he would be unable to say no to it - a lesser cabinet position he could have refused, and then become a thorn in her side from the back benches - and she gave him Foreign Secretary specifically because:  a. He'd already done a great job of burning half the bridges he'd need to walk along to do the job well.  b. It involves travel, which keeps him away and out of her hair.  c. It's a lot of inescapable hard-work, and he's congenitally lazy.  So he can either do a good job of it, but still be at enough of a distance not to be a problem, or else he'll fuck it up, and burn his own political capital in the process, and either way he's going to be far too busy to make any major waves.   Whatever you think of TM as the PM *(and I personally am going from being slightly tepid but somewhat admiring, to absolutely despising her very quickly)*, she's certainly a savvy political operator.  I believe this came about as a mistake.   Next to Johnson's name May had written F.O. and the administrators thought that meant Foreign Office. [This guy...](http://i.imgur.com/ltnfl3q.jpg) I think my point was that the crux of this petition is the Queen's honor. The petition states misogyny and vulgarity as the main reasons to not visit the queen. The petitioners do not care about Trump's discriminatory immigration ban or his visit to the UK. I want her to like chastise him on national TV and demand we give her the country back if we're going to keep fucking it up. Which is why I like the monarchy in my country (Norway)  They are representants of the people, without the politcal motives that often leads to a negativity for many lots of people. Our head of state is very much liked by everyone, because he respect all of the people and don't jump into the political debate that is meant for the goverment and the people to decide. He is just representing us on a more national and connected state.  Meanwhile, the American head of state is disliked by more than half of the population atm. And he is in power for atleast 4 more years. I can't see how a people can stand behind a political powered head of state. However, our King is pretty easy to, because he is not there of political interest, he is above it and it's much easier to accept such a person as you representative.   I would hate having Trump as my representative on the international and national stage.  I think people have a (understandable) skewed view on monarchy, and also it's role in our society now-a-days. But having someone to come together as is very important, especially in these days. They have jumped away from the ruler aspect IMO, and more into the representatives of the people. Having the monarch being born into it is a part of it all really. From a young age they learn their role and take upon themselves to fulfill it, and grow into repective people, atleast they've done so in my country. Agreed. He doesn't and wont ever have enough class to be around her. I say they go through with the petition. Its the only way maybe he will realize his policies are ridiculous. /r/MarchAgainstTrump is try to fight him, but it will take time. Every little bit helps though.  > opulist gesture  I'm not sure why the united states president would need to meet with a irrelevant figurehead with no real power. The idea of a constitutional monarchy is indeed an odd one, but the idea is that people wave their flag at a politically impotent figure not at the PM. Rejecting populism... by not rejecting the embodiment of populism. It's a paradox That's correct. Theresa May is not a populist prime-minister - but IMO, as I previously stated, it was a populist act that open her possibilities of becoming prime-minister. At the time of the Brexit referendum, David Cameron was primer minister and said it would leave his position if the Leave position prevailed, as it happened. Theresa May assuming the prime-minister position was a result of a rise in populism - I don't know if you agree with me or you know what happened at the time in the UK, but several of the Leave voters only voted Leave due to a popular belief that exiting the EU would benefit the entire nation, instead of having an informed and rational decision.  Edit: Grammar. Not exactly, part of the ruling party's manifesto was that they would allow popular vote on the issue of EU membership as part of their election campaign.   Certain divisive issues *are* best decided by popular vote, which is the point of a referendum. A referendum would be good for something like 'should we change our flag?' because it is a neutral issue. On the other hand a referendum would be bad for an issue like 'should we raise taxes on the rich' because it's not a neutral issue and popular vote is never going to determine a fair outcome.  Whether you think Brexit fits either of those is your opinion though. Of course it isn't but the USA is still an important ally and it's probably in the best interests of both our peoples that we try and maintain business as usual.    I think if there is a problem with Trump then what happens is best decided by the people of the USA not 1/65 of the UK.  1 million people have signed it.  64 million haven't. Worst thing is when debated in parliament, a vast majority of MPs were totally behind its use for at least medical reasons  Sorry this was just me blowing off steam in a rant as I was quite passionate about the Snooper's Charter Petition and those that came before it.   You're quite right though not every one is shot down.  The first petition was collected by Wilberforce to demonstrate the public opposition to slavery. They matter as they give ammunition to those who argue the public cares and undermine the argument the public doesn't. That's why Wilberforce invented them and that's what they do. They aren't supposed to be legally binding. Who knows? The pirate party movements across all of europe started with that goal  installing a referendum and petition system like in Switzerland.  And Switzerland does have it.  But, interestingly, this is not the case everywhere. I believe that petition was from 2015 to deny candidate Trump entry. It's a different thing entirely to deny a President of the US entry.  It did get action, they discussed it in parliament. Their belief was ""let him come / let him talk the people are smart enough to see right through him"".  Which turned out great. He could go on Holiday to the UK or visit one of his UK businesses without bothering to visit anyone in a position of political power. State visit will mean loads of meetings, probably with the kinds of people he despises and who despise him, what fun!  Here is a [petition to White House to secure funding and start building a Death Star](https://petitions.obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/petition/secure-resources-and-funding-and-begin-construction-death-star-2016) to which US goverment had to make a formal response.  Online petitions are a cheap way to make headlines, create a lot of noise and achieve absolutely nothing. With these petitions, it's the general rule that a bunch of people from other countries are signing off on them, especially after they go viral on social media like this on did. They have no credibility. Have you been on the e-petition site? It simply requires a name, email address and postcode and then for the user to tick a check box which asks them to confirm they are a British citizen or UK resident.  There is nothing stopping people voting multiple times, in fact there's nothing stopping people voting from other countries.   I'm quite surprised of the validation process to be totally honest. Say the Russian government decided to portray the UK in a negative light by accumulating many more millions of votes. I'm sure Trump would be aware if the story attracts more media attention (as shown surpassing the million signature mark)  which in turn could give Trump a dishonest and damaging opinion of the British majority. Because at least the person going door to door is gathering support from (presumably) the affected area.   As /u/TwoSquareClocks said,  >With these petitions, it's the general rule that a bunch of people from other countries are signing off on them, especially after they go viral on social media like this one did.  let's not forget America is the most powerful country in the world.  [the prime minister is ] not going to act like a petulant child   Edit.  Quoting Love actually Also, use of growth hormones, and sub-clinical antibiotics (basically, continual small doses of antibiotics to increase the growth rate of cattle), which are both banned in the EU. Also, chicken washed with chlorine. Mad Cow happens more than is reported.   If you have a cow that is exhibiting BSE, you don't report it and risk becoming a pariah in your small ranching town/industry, while also upsetting the whole industry.   You shoot it and bury it with a front loader and hope the remainder of your herd is clear.   Not arguing with the other points above or trying to say its some big risk, just that reported cases are lower than actual cases. it's pony I slaughtered this horse last Tuesday.

""Trump is literally allowing women and children refugees to be raped and killed""   -News media right now This could be from Yes, (Prime) Minister. well that's a democratic republic. I believe one of the goals of such a system is to stave off true populism and tyranny of the majority. Cameron is probably shooting a Boris Johnson bird right now It still amazes me that most Leave voting people don't seem to realise that they have been conned. Nevermind the ever growing depth and breadth of the con. Oh good. Well, that should last until the next Tweetstorm at least! ...cause Trump has never been duplicitous in public... I wonder why 4chan didn't mail her a bunch of letters that made moaning and sex sounds when opened. That seems like it would be right up their alley. Did somebody mention Theresa May's stint as home secretary?   Here she is [being found in contempt of court](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/9345345/Theresa-May-accused-of-unacceptable-and-regrettable-behaviour-by-judge.html) after refusing to release an immigrant from custody after being ordered by a judge to do so.   In case you thought she's at least tough on immigration, here's the bit where [she relaxed all border checks](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15632423) for 4 months, a stunning breach of national security.   Or the time Theresa May made the whole country laugh until our bellies hurt by [sending vans to drive around London with signs on the side telling illegal immigrants to go home](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-to-axe-go-home-vans-after-pilot-scheme-deemed-a-failure-8896717.html), a policy that legendary anti-immigrant politician and bestbro of Trump,  Nigel Farage, described as [""nasty""](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-23450438).   Or the time she [banned the special UN rapporteur for violence against women](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/apr/13/un-inspection-yarls-wood-detention-centre-blocked-claim) from visiting a scandal ridden women's detention centre.   Or when she [refused to allow Afghan interpretors working with the British army](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/05/britain-inhumane-and-shameful-over-ayslum-for-afghan-interpreter/) to claim asylum here, a baffling, shameful and inhumane policy roundly condemned even within her own party.   Of course, this is just the entertaining tip of the iceberg of her muddled, scandal prone misadventures as home secretary, that managed to fail both ideologically and practically. How she holds a reputation as a steady hand is beyond me.  Even though she pretty much succeeded.  Worth, amazing game. This, and it pretty much revived the franchise in the west. A new game came out last week.  Showing interest and tugging the sleeves of creators also got Young Justice renewed. I dont think he's ready to be broken; its too soon Never give up on HL3 Awh. Hopes up then helplessly crushed.  I agree with your analysis but I just want to point out one reason why May would be tempted to take on the Premiership - there's no opposition!   She's lucky enough to be facing the most inept Labour leadership in years. The labour party itself has passed a vote of no confidence in Corbyn, but he decided to stay on anyway. He's polling in the low double digits. This is a Tory dream come true.  As a natural Labour voter I'm pretty pissed off.  Because she would never have gotten there the traditional way  > Whatever you think of TM as the PM... she's certainly a savvy political operator.

He looks pretty healthy for once This is museum level art. This petition was created before the ban was signed. Since duplicate petitions aren't allowed, everyone rallied around this one. Referendums are not legally binding in the UK and the Leave crowd who are bitching because the High Court rightly said that Parliament MUST debate and vote on Brexit before anything can go ahead. That's what the guy you responded to was probably referring to, the reaction of the High Court ruling rather than the referendum itself. People of the USA are *trying*. There have already been mass protests, the biggest since the civil rights movement, larger. Several state governments are suing over his executive order. And on top of that non-UK citizens can sign the petition too... How did it not go through then? What stopped it? Well, that is one case where the government literally said 'because of this petition, we will do this'. But of course I agree with you that it was only one small part of the campaign. I hear you, bud. They rejected it because they can't comment on individuals didn't they? If he was there on holiday, it wouldn't be ""in his capacity as head of the US Government"". It would be as a vacationer. If he is welcome there in the capacity as the head of the US Government, then that seems to imply meetings with fellow political leaders. You'd think with the way the UK likes to police its internet they'd be able to tell which of the signatories were actually British. 30,000 of them were foreign according to the BBC article.  Yeah it would be interesting to see the sifted number for this one. There are probably just as many Americans that'd be happy for keeping him from meeting the queen to be honest. I've never seen this kind of public unrest before. You mean the PM isn't going to act like the president? You know that the US has been the closest ally to the UK along with commonwealth countries. We still want good relations with those in Europe who we have historically worked with, but claiming Latvia is a stronger ally to the UK than the US is ludicrous.  It's so ironic how people left the EU expecting to be free to do whatever they wanted only to end up sucking Trump's Tower and hoping he's in a good mood to make deals with them.  Turns out the EU wasn't such a bad place to be in after all. That's even more reason for not slapping the US in the face. And this is why regulation is important.  We need to know where those BSE cows came from, what they ate, and where they were planning to be sent.    All that information would assist us in fighting BSE.  Did a 30 page essay on BSE back in 2006, it was a real shitshow back then, and it was really amazing the length american ranchers would go to to ensure they'd keep spreading the disease through their criminal negligence..... I thought it had to do with limiting the control of one group or state. For instance, very populated states tend to have the same interests.... so giving them massive pull in the elections gives them to much control on their intrests. The electoral college is to spread out this idea  Isn't France a democratic republic? They don't have an electoral college. I think you mean a *federated* republic. > tyranny of the majority  So we should have tyranny of the minority instead?  It's really interesting to read their initial debates about the Electoral College to see what they actually discussed. [Here's a link to one of the initial debates.](http://teachingamericanhistory.org/convention/debates/0725-2/)  If you're interested in more, they have compiled [a summary of each day with links to the full minutes.](http://teachingamericanhistory.org/convention/summary/) If I was Cameron, I'd consider having an operation to permanently fix my hand with the middle finger extended and install a GPS-linked tracking device so he can always know where Boris Johnson is and point it that way.

Her and her husband look like they spend their evenings pulling the wings off flying insects and crapping on each other. > Or when she refused to allow Afghan interpretors working with the British army to claim asylum here, a baffling, shameful and inhumane policy roundly condemned even within her own party.   Oh, she's not alone there. Sweden does (did, they might have started letting them in now) the same thing. >How she holds a reputation as a steady hand is beyond me.   Because the media had a good period of reporting when she became PM that ""she is described as"" a steady hand and whatever other phrases they were using. They all claim that enough and it becomes true in peoples minds.   Whereas to get a real picture requires a fair amount of research. There's no way to really get a picture of what she's like, that you can just go and read listing specific unpleasant decisions/comments/incidents.   Far easier to just have the right image and be described in the right way because most people will never go back and do this. The last one really disgusted me. These people risk their lives and their families to help us, and we don't let them in. > Or the time Theresa May made the whole country laugh until our bellies hurt by sending vans to drive around London with signs on the side telling illegal immigrants to go home,   Wooow, what...? I'd never heard of that and could barely believe my eyes even after I saw the picture from the link. Incredible. succeeded in making a law that is impossible to enforce and has zero effect outside the department of pen ink allocation. Yeah. First thing she did when she got into No.10. I wish we could get a national firewall that blocked wholesome gifs, motivational slogans and cat's doing cute stuff. Can fucking confirm. Picked it up randomly at a GameStop. Best 20$ I have spent in awhile. Hell to the yea it is !  So much pointless dialogue though! Wait, I hadn't heard of this. The labour party literally told him to please leave and he just ignored it? Yes, its getting lost in amongst everything else at the moment, but Labour and the Lib Dems over the past few years have totally knackered any chance of a moderate/left voice being heard in British politics for years probably.   I must admit, I was taken in by Corbyn initially, but some of my principles are more traditional Labour so the more time goes by, the more he weakens in my eyes.. It all started to go pear shaped for me when John Smith died actually. Exactly. All because Len McClusky likes playing kingmaker. Ok so there was a vote on the Labour leadership... Corbyn won, again.  The only people who have no confidence in him are the Blaireite Tory mps in his party.   She always looks like that, I believe it is the most pleasant thing about her.  I can only assume it is a side-effect of destroying civil liberties and/or eating the souls of children. she's always like that, but can't see why it's a negative.   I would usually eat all of those food items, but that presentation makes them impossible to stomach. You can actually update a petition. This petition was created at 2016-11-09 13:13:40.310 and updated on 2017-01-30 13:32:25.178 Referenda can be legally binding, but it has to have been written into it from the start. The referendum a few years back about Alternative Voting was legally binding, but our two about whether to be in the EU have not been.  Exactly. Which is why they mean very little.  Yeah, I think that was the final decision. After a short debate. Unless they require you to sign in and verify your account to vote then all they have is an IP address, so there's not much to go on there... That's because you can put the country you live in on them when you sign. It's not like they're cheating the system or anything [you can see where they come from](http://petitionmap.unboxedconsulting.com/?petition=171928), how many votes from which constituency, they take your postcode as part of the voting process but I suspect they are going a little deeper than that and collecting your ip while they are at it so they can cross reference it with your internet provider and determine who you are. You say ally, for the past 30 years it's been more a case of the UK being the USA's patsy and accomplice (I say this as a Brit). The ""special relationship"" has produced little of note or benefit, instead it's just gotten the UK into various conflicts around the world, whereas our relationship with the EU greatly helped the economy, education, law, and allowed access to a much larger workforce.   Nobody is saying Latvia is a stronger ally than the USA, but the EU certainly is as a union of states.  Oh I see, so like how you'd say:  ""we have peacekeeping forces"",   ""they have terrorists""  The English language is such a mine-field. Why doesn't this have more upvotes The conflict between large vs small states was the biggest divide in the Constitutional Convention. [The small states actually wanted an executive council](http://teachingamericanhistory.org/convention/debates/0604-2/), because they thought that a single executive would always end up being someone from Virginia or Massachusetts. ([They were right. At least for the first 40 years.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States_by_home_state))  Edit: There is more debate on the subject of single vs plural executive, but I linked the one that I did because it included the vote so it can be seen that Maryland, Delaware, and (surprisingly) New York were the states that voted against a single executive. This. It was designed to keep the heavily urbanized areas from controlling the nation at the expense of the rest of it. If we went via straight popular vote, NY, CA, and IL would decide every presidential election. That does not represent the whole country Well the idea (wether or not it was good) is that marginalized people can't be continually railroaded. Actually, I meant more like until this afternoon, but sure: we need dreamers in this country too. [This is how I imagine Mrs May and her husband at home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDBjsFAyiwA) Can that be a thing now, like Santorum? Maybe put the T in too, since may is both a noun and verb already.  TMay: Sex play involving insect torture and scat  ""Well I mean, he was cute, but he likes to TMay, and that just weirds me out"". I don't think the new Digimon game coming out soon will match up, from what I've seen.  Although low expectations of Japanese games always proves you wrong. They [Labour MPs] called for a vote of no confidence in him which meant they had to have a leadership election (again) and the entire Labour Party (members) overwhelmingly voted for Corybn. A number of his MPs are anti-him, but the party's general public supporters, plus the unions, are all behind him. It's complex.  It's not quite like that.  I'm not that well versed in politics but I'll give it a shot, hopefully someone more knowledgeable can correct me.  So, Jeremy Corbyn was voted leader of the Labour party by the common people, ordinary citizens who had paid membership to the party, in 2015. Many Labour ministers disagree with him on various topics, however - it seems they're still in the Blair mindset, and the Labour party under Blair was basically ToryLite. The Labour ministers held a Vote of No Confidence which passed with 172 votes to 40.   Then followed a leadership contest, and a couple of challengers came forward, but eventually only Owen Smith remained. So it was Jeremy Corbyn v Owen Smith for leader of the Labour party. It went to a vote, and the common people voted Jeremy Corbyn into power again - and this time, he had an even bigger share than his original 2015 election. The party leaders wanted him gone, the party members voted him in for the second time in a landslide.  The Labour party is a pit of snakes and Corbyn is the only good thing about it. The PLP (Labour MPs) voted for him to go, but he's won 2 leadership elections amongst the party membership.  That was the MP's, they don't like him because he's too left wing for them, the party members on the other hand have a different view of the matter.   He was elected as leader the first time with 59.5% of the vote, then the MP's had a little spazzy fit and challenged his leadership so there was another election, which he won with 61.8% of the vote.  If anybody is ignoring anything here it is the politicians who are ignoring their membership. Perhaps, if they feel that the labour party returning to the values on which it was founded is a little too left wing for them, they would be more comfortable joining the conservative party, rather than ignoring a significant majority of the membership who are fed up with them trying to destroy the party from the inside. Corbyn is actually a considerably strong leader. The issue is his cabinet/party is filled with a lot of spineless yes men. Think about what he stands to represent and the activism he has done in his earlier career. Not quite - the Labour Politicians told him to leave - the Labour Members (i.e. unions and public) voted for him to stay.   An unusual piece of democracy at work. Unless they have some protections in place, that sounds rather dangerous. For instance, is there anything to prevent this petition from being changed to ""legalize sheep fucking in Wales""? They didn't update it because they didn't want to list a litany of reasons why someone might be opposed to Trump's state visit. That might take a whole book.  But the poster is right that you can't expect it to mention something that hadn't happened when the petition was created. Especially when it was linked in the US only politics forum.. like there aren't Americans with a strong enough opinion that a check box would stop them trying to influence UK politics So all this petitions are for is to make the parliament talk about it but without any kind of obligation to make something out of the result of this discussions?  Strange. Some of those speeches are pretty funny, especially the bit about how the only prison free of drug use was empty and how many compounds are in cabbage. I also liked this brutal putdown:  > **Norman Lamb (North Norfolk) (Liberal Democrat):** I find myself agreeing with everything that the right hon. Gentleman has said, perhaps with the exception of what he has just said. Actually it was much longer than most debates that come out of these petitions. They just decided that preventing Trump from entering the country at all was a bit of an oversimplification in how to deal with him You enter your name, country & postcode on signing, doesn't stop folks lying but that's where they get location data from.  Edit: name too, obviously. Just want to say that the constituencies that are signing the petition in greater numbers tend to be Labour safe seats and University Towns. Not really places the Government are going to be winning anytime soon. Well, to test it, I signed the petition myself since I'm visiting family in Leeds. I have dual citizenship (UK/Canada) but I haven't lived in the UK for 23 years. It still let me sign whereas I was not allowed to vote on Brexit. So yeah, it seems the criteria for being able to sign is pretty lax. I'm sure you could get away with doing a reverse post code look up on the address of a UK proxy and sign just fine. So is the path to school for kids in any country we (US) exercise political will in.   Wrong. The 1790 census shows the population of the United States was 95% rural, 5% urban. There was exactly zero concern of this.   If you read the Madison Debates, then you'd realise that the Electoral College was designed because the Southern States didn't think it was fair to vote for President using a popular vote, since they had millions of people who wouldn't be allowed to vote, and felt like their slaves should count towards their power in government.   TL;DR: Electoral College exists *solely* to give slave states more power because they felt it wasn't fair that blacks in the north could vote.  This is actually completely untrue. The purpose of the electoral college is to stave off the tyranny of the majority. Small states are not intended to have a larger say in who the president is, that is the purpose of the Senate. The imbalance in voting power per-capita is a side effect of appropriating electors over the years. You mean Digimon World: Next Order ? I actually saw nothing about it, but cyber sleuth is pretty damn good !  > the party's general public supporters..., are all behind him     The thing is that he has a lot of support from card-carrying Labour Party Members, whereas a lot of lukewarm left-wingers and floating voters would happily vote for a Blairite but not Corbyn.   IMHO, since the party members are the ones voting for the leader, they elect someone they tend to find popular but who is relatively unpopular amongst the actual average Labour voter.   > Many Labour ministers disagree with him on various topics, however  I dunno about that. I think most Labour MPs agree with his policies. Owen Smith's offerings were nigh-identical. I think the bit Labour disagree with is ""him as a leader"" - and although I also agree broadly with Corbyn's policies, I have to say I get where they're coming from. I haven't been impressed thus far with the way he reacts interviews and at PMQs. I think the same policies but a different leader would be better (but not Owen Smith either because he's also shite.)  I'd also say that calling New Labour ToryLite or right-wing is a tad unfair. New Labour were Centrist, so they were further right than the Labour of old, but they were not particularly right-wing. They did manage to bring in some pretty big things that the Tories had absolutely refused to do - like the National Minimum Wage, for example, which wasn't brought in until 1997, and which the Tories at the time promised they would return to destroy.  They were *still* in opposition to the Tories. They still gave us things the Tories would always have refused to do. New Labour were more like the US Democrats rather than British Labour of old. They're left wing *in comparison to the other cunts*, but they seemed weak and centrist to those on the left.  But you've got to remember we'd had over a decade of Tory-rule and Labour had floundered and got absolutely nowhere. It wasn't until New Labour that the party had a chance with the electorate. And then they managed to hold their position for - was it three governments?   Whether the UK really does have an appetite for Old Labour, which is more what Corbyn represents, I'm not sure. I hope so, because it's what I believe in. But I think what Labour MPs want is to win. And I think they're scared they will lose yet another election with Corbyn at the helm. And then we have another five years of the Tories at the very least. I understand why they tried to throw him out. Now, however, it would be in their interests to put up and shut up and at least put their all in. I think a lot of what you wrote is out of context and misleading.  Blair shifted the Labour party to the Right and rebranded it as **New Labour** after the Thatcher years and John Major's time as Prime Minister. As a result New Labour got themselves into power for 17 years but **reduced voter turnout** because they were just a milder version of the Conservative party and people felt like there wasn't much difference between them. After the recession of 2008, in the 2010 General Election no party won the majority needed to form a government so the Conservatives formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats.  Ed Miliband became Labour's new leader in 2010 and was still part of the New Labour movement, he suffered an even greater defeat than his predecessor in 2015 and the Conservatives formed a majority government for the first time in almost two decades.  Every party has its own leadership election system, in the **2015 Labour leadership election**, Labour supporters (ordinary people who have signed up as members of the Labour party to keep up to date with them) had the choice between four candidates. They elected Jeremy Corbyn (the current Labour leader) by a landslide with an overwhelming turnout compared to previous leadership elections. Corbyn is all about bringing back the original Labour party before they became a Tory-lite party in 1997, and sticking to original Labour left-wing values.  However, the Labour Members of Parliament are full of people who were brought in during the times of the New Labour movement, so only the older Labour Members of Parliament backed Corbyn. Ultimately it became a battle between Labour supporters in the general public and Labour MPs in Westminster.  There was a vote of no confidence from the Labour MPs and they held a **second leadership election** in **2016**, but even more people voted for Corbyn than they did last time.  EDIT: **tl;dr** There's a battle between whether Labour should be left-wing like ordinary Labour supporters want (The Momentum Movement lead by Corbyn) or whether it should be a centrist party like the Labour MPs in Westminster want (New Labour). If you want a US comparison, Jeremy Corbyn is more like Bernie Sanders than anyone else in US politics. Spot on m8. That's pretty much it. Corbyn was a breath of fresh air to begin with - a straight talking, no BS, down to earth politician, but the problem is that he's so abrasive - if you're a Corbyn fan, you're already a Corbyn fan; if you're not, he's not going to win you over. Sounds like it's time to politely throw the leaders out on their coattails. I broadly agree with a lot of his political views, and I definitely prefer his policies to those of the Tories. I've only ever voted Lib Dem or Labour, and I can't see that changing in the near future.   But a strong opposition is a *fundamental part* of a functioning democracy. He has a duty to this nation to hold the government to account, it's absolutely crucial. He needs the support of his party to do so, and he doesn't have it.   The impression I keep getting, time and time again, is of a man who puts his own convictions ahead of his duty to represent the nation. That's not strength, it's stubbornness.  Yeah I really don't see how people don't like Corbyn. He's the only politician I've ever seen that actually could be taken for a normal human being who understands us  indeed. he's a hardworking man of the people. but even the BBC seem to be on a smear campaign against him... or were on a smear campaign against him until he sued them.     It being taboo is half the fun.  I guess we should petition the petition maker to rename the petition 'Legalise sheep fucking in Wales'  But also add the addendum that Trump gets to fuck the first sheep in wales, and actually it's a typo. Now sheep fucking in whales is legal, donald goes first. Exactly that, its a farce. I mean even if half of the signatures were fake/ not from the UK it still has a massive number of UK signatures and I doubt it's anywhere near as high as 50%. Yeah.  Cyber Sleuth was great.  I would recommend you World of Final Fantasy. I've just completed it and I got the feeling of Digimon: CS throughout playing it. On the other hand, Corbyn has delivered an increase in party membership that most politicians would remortgage their grandmothers for.  As u/Miraclefish says, its complicated. The only thing I am reasonably certain of is that at least 75% of what you read in the mainstream media about Corbyn is utter bollocks. None of that means I am a particular supporter of him, but I have generally got more respect for him than I have for those many labour MPs who feel it is more important to throw their toys out of the pram because they didn't get their way (twice) than to present a credible opposition to a government that is deeply damaging the UK. The party members actually voted for *David* Miliband, not Ed Miliband, last time around; Ed Miliband won due to the Union vote in Labour leadership elections. spot on  I think you need to follow him closer. I'm not from the UK, but lean left. I think he's incredible. He's one of a rare breed to politicians who actually talk to people like they're grown up human beings.   Every interview I've watch of him, he's composed, and actually answers the question instead of tip-toeing. Just my opinion though.  His party should be ashamed of themselves.  This is exactly how I feel. He is a politician and man of conviction, which is hugely admirable compared to what we've had recently.  I believe he is the conscience of the Labour Party, like a bearded Jiminy Cricket, but not the right man to lead the country.  I lived in the UK and I was kind of surprised at the circular logic around him. I would ask my coworkers and friends why they didn't support him (in a curious manner not an accusing manor) and the answer I normally got was ""he's unelectable"".   I'd ask what they meant and they'd say he couldn't be elected, in spite of being elected leader of labour. It was such a weirdly circular logic, and they all used the same term I saw in the media, 'unelectable' and then shut off from further thinking.  I never got a real answer on the matter. He's unelectable because he's unelectable because he's unelectable. Weird. Labour are fucked under Corbyn.  Don't get me wrong, he's probably one of the very few genuine politicians in Westminster and I'd love to have a beer with him.  But he's a benevolent dictator in a party that needs an energetic attack dog. I don't mean just at question time, he needs to be all over May and Johnson in the Media.  I was at an event recently, and my local Tory MP was saying that nowadays when she goes to answer a select committee there are literally no Labour MPs there to question her. They aren't turning up. A few years ago her team would have had to cover all potential questions with days of homework. Now, it's the press doing the job of holding the Tories to account. Labour, under Corbyn are practically on strike. He doesn't know who Ant and Dec are... Exactly. It's one thing saying that he's got low approval from the mass public, but he got hundreds of thousands of people joining the party just to vote for him not once but twice, every rally he attends has mass attendance and he does still have union and working class support (even if those people may consider him the lesser evil compared to the Tories).   The media try to vilify him all the time, yet his grassroots support continues to be firm. Unfortunately some of ideas are just never going to get past the public, especially in this climate. Getting rid of trident? That is a big red flag for the majority of the UK. He doesn't have to tiptoe. May/Johnson/Davies have painted themselves into a corner and have no option but to hope for the best, and dodge direct questions.  Corbyn has a very simple platform that's easier to defend.  Watching him in PMQT counting the number of times Cameron (and now May) dodge a question from a member of the public. It's a beautiful thing to watch.   ""Okay, that's six times my learned colleague has failed to answer the question. PLEASE CAN THE PRIME MINISTER ANSWER WHY 148 ""FINANCIALLY RINGFENCED"" A&E DEPRTMENTS HAVE HAD TO CLOSE, SINCE 2010, THROUGH FUNDING CUTBACKS?  ""As I've already explained, the Conservative party is 100% behind the NHS, and has secured a further 28.50 funding to take it through to 2020.""  ""Okay, that's seven times my learned colleague has failed to answer the question..."" I agree. Not that he doesn't have faults but if he went against the referendum he would hand seats to UKIP. I think he's in an impossible position either way. He did get a huge mandate from party members because of his policy and his history. The media here will never give him a fair shot. I don't know what the solution is. I want someone to effectively oppose the Tories and what's the point of having a ""Labour"" government that's basically the same as Tories. People including myself really need to start getting involved in the day to day. Knocking doors, attending marches and meetings and generally being involved.  It's just hard to work and do that too but it's going to take work to make a difference.  Who wants to be my accountabuddy? It's because he doesn't play the same games a lot of career politicians do, and he won't just spout out policies that he has no intent of ever following up on just because it gets the votes in.  And the way he's handled brexit since the beginning has been a little bit shit, but he's in a hard spot seeing as it's such a polarising topic at a time when his leadership is already a bit sketchy.  I love the man, but I do understand some of the concerns labour supporters have over him. Unfortunately for Corbyn the media don't like him. And unfortunately for the British people almost all of our newspapers and TV news are owned by the same person, who doesn't like Corbyn.   Corbyn said he was going to nationalise the trains again and so the owner of one of the train companies illegally released CCTV of Corbyn walking past empty seats after he said there were no available seats. (In fact they were all reserved).   The generation above me (40+ years old) largly either vote the same party they always have or get most of their news from newspapers or TV like they always have. And they're the biggest voting demographic. And there is the problem. Shutting off our brains is what we do best.  It's why we drink so much. > they'd say he couldn't be elected  Tell them we live in a world where the ""unelectable"" Trump just won in America. Obviously they've been Obliviated. Totally agree with you. I'm hoping Tim Farrow can fill that spot you describe, I feel he's got what it takes. However the media have lost interest in the Lib Dems after Cleggo lost it to give him and decent publicity, and are more interested in covering Labour bitching with each other like a bunch of school kids.  I'm from the UK and know who they are, but why should be care who they are?

"35",34,"5qzm6b","2017-01-30","Some information is starting to come out in the French language news about the Quebecois shooter - this is from an article in La Presse. I've done my best to translate relevant parts of it regarding his personality but I will admit that though I speak French, my French is not completely fluent.   >Alexandre Bissonnette is known in the Quebec community for his online comments/criticisms. Upon seeing his photo circulate in the media as the suspect in the Sunday night slaughter, Franois Deschamps, who manages the page of the Welcome Refugees group, said he immediately recognized one of his ""trolls"", a person that was harassing the group online. ""It's been a year since he was seen,"" he said.  >The group administrator says he doesn't think the attack was targeting Muslims, but rather foreigners in general. Deschamps said that Bissonnette would mainly target feminist groups, whom he called ""feminazis"". However, to his knowledge, the young man was not close to openly racist groups.   >People close to him say that he was bullied in school. ""In high school, he and his brother did not really have friends. Alexander, especially, had an anti-social personality"", says Stephanie Guimond, who went to high school with the suspect.  >...""His brother was much more friendly"", says Marc-Andr Malenfant, who also knew Alexandre Bissonnette in high school. ""What I remember most about him is his arrogance.""  >...Police investigators spent the afternoon at the home of Alexandre Bissonnette's parents in Cap-Rouge, under the incredulous eyes of neighbours in this wealthy and quiet neighbourhood. Here, the brothers Bissonnette, identical twins, are known figures on the Rue du Tracel. ""I see them almost every day,"" says Alain Thivierge, who lives right across the street...""Their parents are very friendly"", he said...According to several neighbours, the twins were in the cadets. Alexander, the suspect, never uttered hateful or radical words.  http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/201701/30/01-5064465-le-suspect-connu-pour-ses-critiques-sur-facebook.php  More from [Montreal Gazette](http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-mosque-shooting-suspect-to-appear-in-court-monday-afternoon): >In a post on Facebook, Bienvenu aux rfugis said they learned with sadness and anger about the identity of the terrorist Alexandre Bissonnette, unfortunately known by several militants in Quebec City for his viewpoints that were pro-LePen and anti-feminist, as expressed in social media and at Universit Laval. Alexandre Bissonnette is the only suspect. Where are people getting the ""Muslim on Muslim attack"" from? The other man, Mohammed, was a witness... holy reddit you guys jump to conclusions fast.    To all of you trying to spin this left and right:  Turns out the Moroccan was just a witness. Alexandre Bissonette is the sole perpetrator.  Source: SPVQ, SQ and RCMP. It's a terror attack. Full stop. Thankfully Canada is much better in this regard. In the US, the suspect would be termed a ""troubled white guy""...how Dylan Roof was With all due respect, I don't see why there's some people who have such a strong reaction to what Justin Trudeau said.  A mosque is a place where followers of the Islam religion gather for religious purpose. Followers of the Islam religion are called Muslims. Killing people is clearly terrorizing to citizens, even more so if the killing was targeted against a people with a common point of interest (e.g. religious preferences, ethnicity, etc).  So what's wrong with Trudeau saying that a terrorist attack was launched on Muslims? At least, he uses the term ""terrorist"" rightfully, unlike some people who automatically associate ""terrorist"" with a certain terrorist who was killed when the PSN went down in May 2011... Ban Trump supporters from Canada, they are terrorists. [removed] Its **not a terrorist attack on muslims**. It is a terrorist attack on our values and people. It is a **terrorist attack on everyone**. but if your enemies kill you dont you win?  Terrorism is terrorism. Fuck all who kill innocents no matter who they are.  Fox news is a pile of shit If the assailants are under arrest already, why does it take them so long to release their identity? Unless they're not 100% sure they have the right people? >tens upon tens of terrorist attacks on civilized Western countries by people influenced by Islam  ""Oh no it's not the Islam it's just they were a bad person with some mental problems stop thinking about it as race or religion""          >1 terrorist attack in a mosque   ""Fucking terrorist. Stupid batshit crazy alt right!""  I do not condemn either to the very slightest, but the way people are talking about the recent attack in Canada makes it seem like people are using it to push their own beliefs and propaganda over others.     How the hell did this kid get an AK-47? For Muslims, by Muslims [removed] I love how ppl get to step back and claim moral high ground. Saudi Arabia is a known sponsor of terrorism and main funder of ISIS. Yet Canada and the US keep ratcheting up arms sales. When attacks occur we get to have all these folks who think they're making this crazy stand attack muslims that had nothing to do with it, regular ppl with no money or political power that just believe a different religion than you. 15 out of 19 hijackers in 911 were saudi but nothing. I as a former muslim who's been to Saudi Arabia twice know first hand what they think and what they're optimal goal and i'm speaking about the elites in the kingdom. If  you want to be honest go to your local MP and ask him to make a stand and put economics to the side to stop funding terrorism. But dont attack someone living their life who holds a different belief than you, thats cowardice.  Why are you guys arguing? Get it together terrosist attack on muslim.... by muslim lol these guys are so hateful ""Pro-LePen""? Shooter was a white male Trump supporter. Now of course 'not all Trump supporters' are terrorists, but perhaps they should be banned from Canada unless they undergo 'extreme vetting.' http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-mosque-shooting-five-remain-in-critical-condition-following-attack   It's too convenient. Can't let go of it even when the information is corrected.  >Where are people getting the ""Muslim on Muslim attack"" from?   Propaganda from 14 hours ago courtesy of the t_d and /pol/ brigades. It's not an accident, its the_Nazis doing damage control. Every single day they have multiple posts dehumanizing and attacking all Muslims with comments calling for violence. Yes, all Muslims. Not radical Muslims, not terrorists, no, all Muslims. I know because I have documented their posts repeatedly over at /r/againsthatesubreddits. But /u/spez continues to shield the_cuckold from a ban for violating Reddits rules on inciting harm and violence. There was a guy on cbc Toronto who was inside the mosque at the time saying there were 2 people with masks on who entered the mosque... > To all of you trying to spin this left and right:  When it was discovered that a Moroccan was involved: Silence on Le Reddit; Le Reddit on lockdown.  When it was discovered that he was (alleged) a witness: Proclamations that this was an attack on Muslims! Post! Post! Post!!!  Honest, unbiased reporting would not go a miss here.  PM Trudeau's statement is true(ish). It was a terrorist attack on Muslims... by other Muslims. For anyone keeping score  Terrorist attacks by Muslims: 2526374844  Terrorist attacks against Muslims: 1  The sky is falling lol Um, no. There are people across the U.S. calling it terrorism, hell, even the nuts over at The_Donald have called it a terrorist act. Don't presume to know the thoughts of 300 million other individuals just because of what someone on a television tells you.      I just read your post outloud to a group of people, one of them replied ""People get touchy about it because there have been attacks and they always hesitate to call them terrorist acts."" I feel like the issue lies with pointing out they were Muslim. They were Canadian.. it was an attack against us. The identities of the gunmen have already been released. You and I and practically everyone here, we all already know who the gunmen were and why they did it. The gunmen are supremacist, fascist, aggressive idiots. They believe they are better than others. They are afraid of others. They are ignorant of other cultures and world views. They impose their views on others.  What you are obsessing with is if they are Muslims or Christians or whatever, which is actually irrelevant. Islamists and Nazi skinheads and KKK and religious police in Iran and KSA are all the same kind of scum, and really belong to the same side of this battle. Nice people are on the other side, and it is time they recognized this. >Its not a terrorist attack on muslims.   I'm confused. It was literally an attack on Muslims. Maybe you don't like the political implications of what he was saying? But there's nothing false in his statement. Um why not both? It's an attack on western values, regardless of whether the perpetrators were fellow Muslims, Trumpists, French nationalists, atheists, or First Nations. Where they haven't had to deal with radicals or persecution, Muslims have lived well for centuries as minorities; look at the ancient and still tolerated Muslim minorities of Tatarstan, the Hui of China, the Cham of Southeast Asia, the indigenous Muslims of Eritrea, the Lipka Tatars of northeastern Europe, Madagascar, South Africa's Cape Malays...The biggest causes of the current strife between Muslims and non-Muslims are radical zealots on both sides, not something omnipresent in Islam's DNA. Perfectly put! Why are our leaders trying to divide us into groups? Sharia is your values? it was a terrorist attack on my Canadian brothers and sisters and it is unacceptable. i'm saddened by the amount of people in this thread trying to deny that this was a terrorist act and have their panties in a bunch because a white alt righter is being rightfully called a terrorist.  A terrorist attack on Muslims *is* a terrorist attack on all of us. It is specifically a terrorist attack on Canadian Muslims, and it is also a terrorist attack on Canadians in general. Oh. So when it is Muslims perpetrating the attacks then it is an attack on the West....but when it appears to be Westerners doing it to Muslims then it is ""not a terrorist attack on Muslims""..  R/Worldnews logic  Plz continue with your hatefest of Muslims, and more such attacks will happen. What's interesting about this fake quote, /pol/? All mainstream media has a bias. CNN is left biased, Breitbart is right biased. ABC is left biased, fox news is right biased. MSM is a pile of shit, not just fox news.  Nope. Only one suspect, and he's white. Is there a reason that you and others in this thread are lying about this?  I'm honestly curious.  There has been no report whatsoever that these attackers were Muslim, and you're doing nothing here but further inciting prejudice and hatred.  EDIT - In fact, it turns out that Mohamed Khadir was just a witness and the **only** suspect in the crime is Alexandre Bissonnette - http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-mosque-shooting-five-remain-in-critical-condition-following-attack The only suspect Anexandre Bissonnette likes Trump and le pen.  Nope, sole attacker was not. the most recent reports are one white anti muslim man and an ex muslim Arab. This was most likely an anti Muslim terror attack  [removed] How do you know that? https://www.google.co.uk/amp/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN15E0F6  https://theintercept.com/2017/01/30/suspect-in-quebec-mosque-attack-quickly-depicted-as-a-moroccan-muslim-hes-a-white-nationalist/  No Of course not. I don't think so but it's only speculation It's not clear yet. The police detained two men, one with an Arabic name and one with a French name. The police have now clarified that one is a witness and one is a suspect, and they haven't revealed who is who yet.  this information is not yet officially available, so Trudeau is officially talking out of his ass (although it's very possible that he's not wrong, it's just not confirmed to be true if it is) Because Canadian judicial system works differently from the US system. We generally do not publicize names in effort to prevent inaccurate information from leading to witch hunts. It also leads to less crime fame and ensures that if you select a Jury trial you get a fair one.  Unless the source is from the RCMP, its uncorroborated.  > The suspects, men in their late 20s and early 30s, were not known to police and the investigation into a possible motive continues, said superintendent Martin Plante of the RCMPs C Division. He would not confirm the identity of the victims.  > We must respect the judicial process, we cannot reveal suspects identities yet, he said, adding that it was still too early to determine what charges the suspects in the case will face.   There is no rush to release this information because its irrelevant, they wont be tried differently because of race or beliefs. They will face justice based on the actions. It's not for the police to determine who is guilty and not, that's for a court to decide. Its been released.  That's all anyone on Reddit really cares about, isn't it? How shameful. Oh everyone cut the BS. If it was a racist white dude, it would be slathered all over the news by now, and you know it. Not if the shooter specifically targeted Muslims, which it seems like he did. I believe the actual attacker was a white nationalist. The other suspect was a witness who actually called 911. https://twitter.com/HuffPostQuebec/status/826115220238131200 ""The SQ now affirms that there is only one suspect, Alexandre Bissonette, in the attack against the mosque in Quebec."" No it wasn't. The sole attacker was a white Quebecer. Stop spreading this bullshit.  I believe the actual attacker was a white nationalist.   The other suspect was a witness who actually called 911.  https://twitter.com/HuffPostQuebec/status/826115220238131200  ""The SQ now affirms that there is only one suspect, Alexandre Bissonette, in the attack against the mosque in Quebec."" ***FMBM*** I believe the actual attacker was a white nationalist.

And why is that? I'd call it confused brutality, not cowardice. They were attacked because they're Muslim, not because they're Canadians. There's no segregation here dude, just statements - especially because he called them ""Muslim-Canadians.""  White nationalist who loved Trump.  White nationalist who loved Trump.

Marine Le Pen is a French politician who leads a right wing party in France Some Trump supporters, I suppose, are good people. How would one go about banning Canadians from Canada? Clearly this guy is a piece of shit but banning Trump supporters doesn't solve this problem. Was he? I liked a few of Sanders posts on facebook once upon a time but I'm not a Sanders Supporter nor was.  Shooter also followed NDP Jack Layton and George W Bush, are they responsible for this atrocities too?  Of course not, but people will do anything to justify their hatred on Trump even though this happened in Canadian Soil, amirite? This is ""Trump's Canada"" IMO The fuck is with the italics? Eyewitness reports of chaotic events like this tend to be extremely unreliable. First, the police have now interviewed the people at the mosque including your guy from CBC, so if they're saying it was one guy then that's probably the consensus at this point. Lots of bullshit ""information"" is produced within the first few hours of an attack, but it gets sorted out later.  Second, the police have already established that of the two arrested, only Alexandre Bissonnette is suspected of the shooting. The other guy they initially arrested - Mohamed Belkhadir - was actually helping out the injured. So even if there is a second shooter, it would be some friend or associate of Alexandre Bissonnette, which makes him another right wing fuckwad.  So it **still** doesn't support the ""Muslim on Muslim"" theory unless you assume that a Muslim hater got together with a Muslim to murder some Muslims praying at a mosque. That is a tragically hilarious attempt to stretch facts. That's the exact opposite of what happened, but even if that had happened, I don't see how that would have dishonest or biased. My reaction would have been, ""Wait, we ignored the ridiculous speculation and gave all our attention to the truth? Hooray!"" You're falling victim to your biases. Reddit was flooded with stuff from the right about unconfirmed reports that it was a Muslim. Now that it's been proven that's a lie, all the right has stopped talking about it. Go to /r/the_donald, there's no mention now that it's an attack on, not by Muslims. That's not at all what happened though. Both sides of the aisles are trying to exploit this, which is shameful.  I wish people weren't this binary. What ever helps you sleep at night, goon. [removed] No it wasn't. Police confirmed it's only one suspect, and he's a white guy. Police NEVER confirmed Mohamed Khadri was a suspect, that was just media speculation. Where did you find anything stating the religion of the attackers? Hasn't been posted anywhere.... How do you figure? The suspect has the most French-Canadian name there is? The only suspect Anexandre Bissonnette likes Trump and le pen, and Dawkins.  I doubt he is a Muslim This has been proven false dude. Correct yo shit. One of their names is Alexandre Bissonnette.  Probably not Muslim, a native Quebecer. No Muslims were involved in carrying out this attack. Stop spreading misinformation and hate. Yes it would appear to be that, which is not as uncommon as people would think. In fact, most of the violence that groups like ISIS are dishing out is on muslims by muslims. It's messed. Except it wasnt, it was by an anti-muslim white Quebecois and an ex muslim Moroccan.  Fuck your racist bullshit assumptions.  **Edit:** Moroccan is now considered witness, only suspect is white Quebecois Alexandre Bissonette, Who's facebook is filled with 'likes' of far right wing pages/people. False, Muslim guy was witness  Was it? You are so smart... Nope, it was by the *real* enemies of freedom, the alt-right. It was by some white guy. Probably Christian.  Do you know something the rest of us don't know? All reports now are that one of the two arrested last night was a suspect and the other was a witness, and we don't yet know which was which. Maybe you should avoid speculation until we actually know something. Where's your source for the numbers?   You do realize that the majority of terrorist attacks in the Middle East kill other Muslims right?  More Muslim have died to terrorist attacks than everyone else.  Um, you're making shit up and really, you should know better. But yes, feel free to diminish the loss of life over some ideological bullshit. Hahaha but we will never know!! Unless the source is from the RCMP, its uncorroborated.  From the article you've been posting plastered all over.  > The suspects, men in their late 20s and early 30s, were not known to police and the investigation into a possible motive continues, said superintendent Martin Plante of the RCMPs C Division. He would not confirm the identity of the victims.  > We must respect the judicial process, we cannot reveal suspects identities yet, he said, adding that it was still too early to determine what charges the suspects in the case will face.  Source?  I think his comment was more meant to be sarcasm because the culprits turned themselves in right after they did it.  still curious why this comment is getting wrecked. Work up a spine and type a response to go with your downvote Yeah, Mohammed Khadir sounds like a straight up Nazi.  Why has this comment been so downvoted? I for one completely agreed. The hateful are the enemy. Though they claim to oppose each other, their goal of dividing us and setting us against one another is one and the same. por que no los dos If the attacker was Muslim, they would say Muslims attacked us. But the terrorist was a far right Islamophobe so his friends on Reddit are trying to take attention off the victims and water this story down by getting upset someone mentioned who was actually attacked. These people are pure evil. [removed] Frankly I'm taking most of the comments in here with a grain of salt. I hardly consider redditors to be experts on politics and culture and most of us usually have a personal agenda or bias whether we admit it/are aware of it or not, and we will comment according to those ideals whether or not they're well-founded.   I'm sure the person who attacked the mosque had ill intent to the Muslims within it. Pretending it wasn't an attack on Muslims is folly. But we also don't have all the facts and angles, so who knows what the guy was thinking.   And we can't really feed a narrative of ""it's an attack on western ideals, not the Muslims!"" either since that is in itself an idealization of circumstances. I highly doubt the attacker had a well thought out game plan to terrorize western ideals. But there again, we don't have all the facts or expertise so we can't say that either.    Fact of the matter is someone blew up something else.  They were angry. They took it out on others. It's tragic and we should acknowledge that. What that means for national and cultural safety I have no idea.  Wasn't it more like a attack on Canada and Canadians? I assume those muslims living in Canada are Canadians no?  Just like the French terror attack, was an attack on France and French people. No real prime minister or president went out and said ""This is a terrorist attack against Christians"". This is where I stand.   Obvious attack on Muslims, and by extension the national values that push for diversity and inclusiveness.   Next time, you gotta link the little Mexican girl saying why not both, otherwise you're wasting a golden opportunity, like the time I turned down a wet work playdate. An attack on Muslim Canadians, and Canadian society. Blaming Christians for Muslim attacks is a really shitty liberal thing to do. The biggest strife is Saudi funding for extremist mosques and Imams.   When Muslims are faithful, persecuting Christians is lawful under Sharia law. Explains plenty about their societies as Christian minorities do terrible in majority muslim countries.  [removed] > It's an attack on western values  Cause Eastern values support massacring innocents? Get out of here. > The biggest causes of the current strife between Muslims and non-Muslims are radical zealots on both sides, not something omnipresent in Islam's DNA.  This is what needs to be considered. This is what a lot of people seem to wilfully ignore. If Islam itself was such a violent ideology, then why isn't the world a complete bloodbath? The media might make it seem like it is a bloodbath, what with constant reports of conflict and murder, but [we live in one of the most peaceful and secure times](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-20208505).   Just go look at the list of terrorist attacks that were happening during the 70's in different regions.    Edit: Link Most governments and especially liberal (leftist) governments like to have labels for everything and everyone.  Its much easier to control groups if they feel they have been given special preference or treatment, and if the groups are super segregated and small.  The more labels given the smaller the groups.  That way if they lose one groups interest for whatever reason the impact is small with regards to re-election, which is all most governments care about. identity politics. It is considered racist and Insensitive for me to say ""I look at you as a human being"" at my university.  Clearly, they have a muslim agenda. Perhaps it's like the Stepford wives only they're trying to replace us all with muslims... /s Freedom of religion is. And it might shock you to learn that many muslims do not believe in the Sharia as universal basis for law. Your comment is an insult to reading comprehension. What's wrong with saying an attack on one of us is an attack o all of us regardless of religion? Is that exactly what we want?  It was done by muslims, so your argument is invalid Go rape a goat Is Muslim a skin color?   To be fair, plenty of media outlets in Canada have reported Mohamed Khadir as one of the suspects, until they were corrected by the RCMP   They're violent, far right Islamophobes and they know they have blood on their hands so they do what they always do: dehumanize, lie, and spread fake news. I hope Trudeau sets an example and cracks down hard. > Is there a reason that you and others in this thread are lying about this? I'm honestly curious...  Ummm, unless OP ninja-edited (and I don't see an asterisk), then they were just asking a question. Last I checked, asking for clarification and making a false statement were two different things. Is it any wonder that people have to ask for the facts, when the ""journalists"" that they rely upon for the truth are wrong more often than not? Maybe you should direct your ""curiosity"" to the commentors that *are* perpetrating false statements. [removed] [removed] [There is only one suspect now](http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/201701/30/01-5064465-un-seul-suspect-sur-les-deux-individus-arretes-hier-affirme-la-sq.php). Not two.  His name is Alexandre Bissonnette. > The attackers where yelling Allahu Ackbar.  Only one witness has claimed the shooters said that, and no other witness has verified it.   It was also a mosque during prayer services....during a shooting  > It is a common Islamic Arabic expression, used in various contexts by Muslims; in formal prayer, in the call for prayer (adhn),as an informal expression of faith, in times of distress, or to express resolute determination or defiance.  as for:  >Attackers are hands down Muslims!  well  >So far, the white guy, Alexandre Bissonnette, is 100%not Muslim if you check his Facebook. He seems anti-Muslim: his likes include ""Israeli Defense Forces, Marine Le Pen, Richard Dawkins, Donald J. Trump,"" and in a lot of his pictures, it's about Megadeth, drinking wine/beer, and partying.  Alexandre Bissonnette called the police after the events saying it was him. He was found with the guns.  Mohamed Khadir was arrested on site, there is still a chance that he is innocent. He wasn't with Alexandre Bissonnette and didn't confess to the crime like Bissonnette did. But on the other hand, can you point to a Shiite/Sunni attack that's happened in North America? (I actually don't know if there have been any, and would be interested to hear about any.)   This is what's weird about the attack, and why the ""Allah Akbar"" seems like it was obviously intended to be ironic. Never happened before, but there have been so few attacks like this, that that is no surprise.   [removed] Turns out you have to retract, the Moroccan was only a witness.  The Quebecker is the sole suspect as per police. Jesus fucking christ NO.  The man who claimed responsibility and was arrested with the gun on him is White Quebecois, the second suspect who was arrested on site is Moroccan.  Also, 'Allahu Akbar' is just as common to be yelled out by someone *being* shot at as it is by the shooter, its the Arabic equivalent to 'Oh my God/Praise God' and can be used both in the standard way put out by media narrative as a chant attackers yell, but also as something someone fearing for their very life will shout out as they got shot at, they hear bullets flying towards them and so they shout out ""Oh my God please save"" which is what Allahu Akbar more or less translates to in that situation.  Fuck you and your racist assumptions.  **Edit for update/visibility:** Police have updated to state that one of the two arrested is now no longer considered suspect and is now considered a witness, while the other remains a suspect. News sites have removed the names of the two as the police have not clarified which is which, but I have reason to believe that the witness is the Moroccan and the suspect is the White Quebecois, as I had previously seen it reported that the latter had called police to turn himself in and was arrested while in possession of a weapon. This is not fact however and should not be taken as such, it is merely my guess based on the evidence I have seen so far.  Link to updated/ongoing news coverage: http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-city-mosque-gun-shots-1.3957686 It seems you are going based on erroneous early reports. Someone shouted it during the shooting, likely a victim.  You can't be serious. Because people said one thing you think that's able to identify them. Dumbest logic I've ever heard. For all you know they could be anti Muslim trying to stir the pot... I mean they did attack a mosque.  Like its one thing to say "" I think they could be""  But there's always one asshat drawing conclusions from inconclusive evidence and his own personal opinion   Ps what does being Moroccan have to do with anything? Not a religion...  that is literally by definition racism.  [removed] The reports say the attackers had a thick Quebecois accent. It was mostly likely said to be witty. Although its possible that they were recent converts, its seems unlikely.  Edit: Turns out the Quebecois guy isnt a convert  >Truly a stunning twist  If you haven't paid any attention at all to the rise of neo-nazism in North America and Europe over the last decade, sure, I suppose this would be a real fuckin' shock. There was false information early that a moroccan national was one of the shooters when he was actually a witness.  The actual terrorist is a white dude. No.  [Alexandre Bissonnette is the suspect](http://www.metronews.ca/news/canada/2017/01/29/quebec-city-police-confirm-shooting-at-mosque.html?platform=hootsuite).  The other man is the witness. Interesting, did not know that. If they were white supremacists their names, pictures, and entire bios would have been released within one hour of the attack. It was though. It was an atheist white dude Turns out you were wrong. Finnish terrorists? It was very specifically aimed at Muslims. To spin it as some feel-good ""we the people"" thing is ignorant. Disregarding any politics, it was very deliberately against Muslims.  Do we even know their motives? Could be intramuslim violence. One of the attackers was from Morocco  Thanks.  Is she a French equivalent to Trump?  Or more right wing? When the US is sending their people, they're not sending their best. I WAS BEING SARCASTIC. SORRY.

I gave the police the best information I possibly could, and was strongly certain about the accuracy of my information. Hours later, when more details about the incident were released, I found that just about everything I told the police was inaccurate. Never trust your memory during traumatic experiences. Yea let's just hope all responsible are caught. Yea when I seen the name I was surprised at the time, but this morning everyone was reporting 2 suspects...do you not think muslims murder muslims? It's not a far stretch at all. In the end hopefully the police get their man and it sounds like they did. This is really difficult to keep up with. Canadian nationalism seems pretty dangerous. Might need to build that wall to the north. How does that make him a white nationalist? Not only a White guy but a Trump supporter judging by his social media trail. Looks like Trump and Brietbart's rhetoric are starting to trickle down. You can be white and be a Muslim... He also likes the NDP and Jack Layton.  It's confirmed he was a far right Islamophobic terrorist. Trump and the far right have blood on their hands now. We must take action! Sounds like a common profile here...Dawkins lovin, Trump lovin, Pro-Israel right winger... Why are you forgetting Mohamed Khadir   > In fact, most of the violence that groups like ISIS are dishing out is on muslims by muslims. It's messed.  It happens with every religion or group really. Its a messed up thing in general but is not unique to any single belief structure.  It has more to do with a US vs THEM mentality. Absolutely agree, and your point is well taken. The challenge is the syntax. If someone tells you their was a ""Terrorist attack on Muslims"" their is an implication the attacker was not also a Muslim. do you know this yet?  I am going to save this comment for later,  and see who is right.  Not to sound like I'm disbelieve you but do you have a source? I've definitely read that one was white quebecois, but I haven't heard anything else about the other man. You should, uh, change up your statements and spread them out a bit. Or you'll look a little suspicious... yes that was my point.  see ... no one cared I have no idea what you're on about; I haven't shared an article anywhere. Who are you intending to respond to? Not a suspect anymore. A witness.  I guess many readers started reading the first two sentences, recognized themselves in there, and promptly downvoted the comment without ever giving it a thought.  Or maybe they just thought my comment was the usual annoying attack on white nationalists that ignores the equally bad or worse islamofascists.  Or maybe someone clicked a button somewhere to trigger downvotes.  I don't know. The 21st century is such a surreal shitshow. > ""It was an attack on muslims""  > ""It was an attack on everyone""  Is this like the new 'all lives matter'?   Where are you getting your news from?  Is ""was a far-right Islamophobe"" now synonymous with Muslims who do not like Shia? Because that's the only thing being reported right now, there is absolutely zero evidence that this was a  ""far right Islamophobe""  I have no issue being wrong, but I don't see it yet.  It seems like we're all so quick to defend our ideologies on tidbits and yet to be confirmed information.  Edit: I find it telling that when it comes to Muslims and terrorism you are all so quick to say the actions of one do not condemn the whole, but when the shoe is on the other foot it's ""they are pure evil"".  When it comes to the mass murderer, it would be nice if things were so simple. In fact apart from shooting a bunch of people no links to far right extremism have emerged. You should also not use the term ""islamophobe"" if you actually know what it means. It's an offensive bigoted term grounded in religious fundamentalism.  The guy apparently merely had different tastes. He didn't like Muslims or feminists (which branch is unknown, many today are extreme). He also liked Trump. None of those are extreme or far right positions. Lots of people don't like things but don't go on shooting sprees over it. Going by the reports so far there's really nothing to indicate any kind of extreme behaviour or extreme beliefs. The only thing really put forward beyond his particular tastes is the old he was a bit of a loner.  In this case the motive in going that far is somewhat puzzling. Put it this way: You dislike people who don't have the same political beliefs as you and you label these people the far right. It's clear that you hate them. Would you go an shoot a bunch of them though?  You're always going to have some psychopaths that will just pop one day. Still it's pretty rare for their to not be some kind of link to further extremism, precipitation or triggering event. It will be interesting to see what the investigation turns up.  Edit:  Hilarious thing, there's a post on his face book page from November of some place saying ""I will visit this place one day."". No, he wont. > The biggest strife is Saudi funding for extremist mosques and Imams.  And who is giving all this cash to the Saudi's? Christian-majority nations like the UK and the US. We buy their oil and sell them weapons for decades.  I'm saying that it can be either. Currently, most radical Islam is caused by Muslim zealots, followed by sectarian persecution in Iraq, Syria, and Saudi Arabia, followed by Christian and other anti-Islam extremists. In the same way that slaughtering apostates is in the Bible, the Bhagavad Gita is about Hindu holy war, and Zen Buddhism is fine with war and violence.  What on _Earth_ are you on about?? Is it opposite day where you live?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Islamist_terrorist_attacks This is an outright lie. Official, current police statements say that the sole suspect is Alexandre, who has apparent online ties to Trump and the like.  https://twitter.com/tvanouvelles/status/826115972511719424  Care to try that again? Except it wasn't, so your argument is not only invalid, but his is proven correct.  Go fuck yourself and your racist bullshit. He's not from a trailer park in Alabama. Actually he was just asking a question. If you weren't so deluded with this fantasy world you've constructed you'd have noticed the question mark at the end of his sentence. Out of curiosity, if you were him what would you do? To be ironic, possibly. If it's an anti-Muslim attack, then the whole attack is clearly meant to be a direct copy of Muslim terrorist attacks. So it's no surprise they would also copy the ""Allah Akbar"" part. allah akbar is the same as oh my god for muslims. They say it all the time especially when things are super intense. In the most intense moment of this dudes life it's not crazy to think he would resort back to saying allah akbar while murdering people   This was a Sunni mosque. Sunni Muslims don't shoot up sunni mosques. This was an anti Muslim terror attack  This is sad to even mention, but over here, yelling this expression has become associated with commiting an act of terror.  It just seems to me like the attackers used the expression ironically. Multiple witnesses were saying they dont actually know if it was the attackers shouting or the people being shot at. 'Allahu Akbar' is synonymous with 'Praise God', but also with 'Oh my God', it is something that someone getting shot at and in fear for their life would yell out in their last moments.  Take your racist asssumptions and shove them up your ass. [removed] Reputable sources AP/ Reuters are now reporting Bissonnette will amend comment. There have been no large scale acts of sectarian violence in North America among Muslims based on my research of his topic. Fair point. They just did, and the sole perpetrator was not. Except they just announced the only suspect is Alexandre Bissonnette, a white guy who liked right-wing Facebook pages.  Sucks to be wrong eh? The only suspect Anexandre Bissonnette likes Trump and le pen.  Nice prediction!  [removed] Unlike your cable news driven American media, most suspects in Quebec are not named publicly until they appear in court. So they were Muslims yet they shot up Muslims only, and now the media wants to use this as a reason to ban Muslims. Do you not see how they have manipulated the situation to make it even worse for Muslims?  They got shot up and now you're using that to discuss why they should be banned... Incorrect, the current government has stated its a terrorist attack on muslims so likely they are looking for a way to spin it IF they are found to be muslim attackers that killed muslim people.  Now that both shooters are in custody its only a matter of time till we get the lowdown.  A total ban on muslims is not the correct way to deal with this but you do know that Daesh (ISIS) is using the refugee route to bring their operatives into other countries.  Daesh would have to be stupid not to.  Its the easiest route into the west and Western Europe.  Its smart to have additional provisions to protect your own citizens. [removed] Please explain how Allahu Akbar has anything to do with race. New reports are now validated by AP/ Reuters will amend. One of them is white Quebecois, and the other is Moroccan, nothing has been said whether they're Muslim or not, and it was announced hours ago.    The previous Islamic attacks in Quebec were carried out by converts. Islam is a religion, not a race. Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, and Lebanon all have large French speaking populations.   If you can point me to single case of non-muslim attackers yelling Allahu Ackbar, then I might consider it. Reality doesn't support this theory. Canada tries to avoid things like the Boston bomber witch hunts that Reddit was responsible for inciting. Because sometimes good people get hurt.  I believe the system is in place elsewhere it remembers the actions, the victims but the perpetrators are generally in the body of the article and never in headlines. However due to how Search is so heavily skewed I cant find the study that references the details.  Generally we don't want people attacking friends and families of these individuals in retribution nor do we want to create more attacks on a particular group.  Cases like this are so rare I cant imagine the defendants would opt for a jury trial. As you can imagine public sentiment for these types of actions are incredibly negative so its likely going to see priority trial once the Crown (The Government) has what it needs to proceed with a trial.  Once the case has been closed and leads have been exhausted the details will be released. The RCMP will generally tear through these guys lives and ensure there aren't organizations working inside the country or additional attacks planned similar to how anti-gang operations are handled here. Are you going to eat your words when proven wrong? Not about the supremacist part, since we all know you just mean white.  Yes, exactly. He clearly didn't target them for being Canadian, considering he is Canadian himself. >Could be intramuslim violence.    If that's the case, it means they were attacked because they're Muslim. Sunni v. Shia, etc.  But since you bring up Morocco - so it could be a Christian Moroccan. How about we wait for more information before deciding what happened based on little-to-no info, eh? Update: The Moroccan was a witness. I don't really follow French politics that much, she definitely isn't a Trump in the things she says but her party is anti-EU, anti-immigration...pretty far right Hard to really quantify politicians operating in different countries, but yeah, she's basically a Trump style conservative, whose party is probably closest to UKIP amongst Anglosphere political parties. Notably anti-muslim + immigrant. lol.  All kidding aside, however, its increasingly obvious how DIVIDE and CONQUER tactics are used by the ruling class to keep us demonizing each other while they run off with all the money. BOTH 'sides' are being played by greedy billionaires who will keep on getting away with it until we work together to make corruption illegal again. Represent.Us has the best plan I've seen to do this for America. The beauty of it is 1) totally non-partisan and 2) circumvents dirty politicians by using citizen-driven ballot initiatives. I hope Canadians take a similar approach.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhe286ky-9A False memories turn out to be incredibly easy to create. I recall reading about a study where they asked some subjects to tell them about some of their childhood experiences, and then in a followup interview a few weeks later they asked them to provide a few more details about a totally fictitious scenario the researchers claimed they'd revealed in the previous interview involving them getting sick from eating strawberry ice cream. Not only did most of the subjects provide the details that were asked for, some of them actually became nauseated when offered strawberry ice cream in a third meeting. The false memory had stuck after simply being asked ""hey, do you remember the time when...?""  Or at least, I *think* I recall reading about such a study... And now someday you might recall reading that study too, if it comes up. Sorry you went through that. Very very rare in Western Countries. They do it in the Middle East because whichever faction control Government, controls the religion...in Canada for example everyone is free to practice their religion without persecution.   Do not conflate goings on in other parts of the world as norms. They aren't.  The full story is out. Reports of his facebook being covered in white nationalist material. Except there is zero indication that he's Muslim. Yeah but that goes against the narrative.  Wait a second, when a muslim does an attack people yell that not every muslim is a terrorist, one radical splinter from right does attack and its suddenly trumps and his administrations fault... eh... Not rooting for anyone but is this not hypocrisy? He was declared a witness, not a suspect. He's no longer a suspect He's a witness, not longer a suspect: http://globalnews.ca/news/3213677/quebec-city-mosque-shooting-alleged-gunmen-identified-as-alexandre-bissonnette-mohamed-khadir/ Alexandre Bissonnette called the police after the events saying it was him. He was found with the guns.  Mohamed Khadir was arrested on site, there is still a chance that he is innocent. He wasn't with Alexandre Bissonnette and didn't confess to the crime like Bissonnette did. I believe the actual attacker was a white nationalist. The other suspect was a witness who actually called 911. https://twitter.com/HuffPostQuebec/status/826115220238131200 ""The SQ now affirms that there is only one suspect, Alexandre Bissonette, in the attack against the mosque in Quebec."" Even if your a 10th generation Canadian, you can retain a ethnic name. It's tribalism, it's backwards and it will eat itself because people who subscribe to that are violent and stupid for the most part and it's inevitable that it will crash and fail.  Well as a Canadian, I don't worry so much about that because assumption isn't really a thing in our press getting the story out for the most part. So, we generally know what's happening with some certainty after the first 24 hours. Even when the government is trying to create another narrative such as what happened about 2 years ago with the deaths of some service people here. Both events happened at the hands of mentally ill folks and the gov of the day wanted to make them ""terrorism"" but the news outlets quickly found out and reported the mental illness aspect of both cases and only the stalwarts shouted terror and quickly exposed themselves as ignorant and closed to the truth of the matter.   It's going to take a generational die off to clear this up. It's all crap that old people are hanging on to or clinging to that is being the key and gate to peoples fears.  The racial identity of the two shooters has been confirmed, however my comment about anti-muslim and ex-muslim are based on what I've seen on various news sites, but has not been officially confirmed by the police themselves.  **Edit: New Info, please see below comment** [removed] Yeah yeah whatever man. Fuck off.  Thanks, bud!  Be careful here.  Alexandre Bissonnette called the police after the events saying it was him. He was found with the guns.  Mohamed Khadir was arrested on site, there is still a chance that he is innocent. He wasn't with Alexandre Bissonnette and didn't confess to the crime like Bissonnette did. All lives matter!  Oh, a ban on Muslim refugees fleeing war?  Only some lives matter! Um, the suspect likes Le Pen and Donald Trump. The other ""suspect"" was cleared as a witness, not a shooter (The one with Mohammed in his name).  http://www.metronews.ca/news/canada/2017/01/29/quebec-city-police-confirm-shooting-at-mosque.html?platform=hootsuite  I won't judge until the suspect turns into a criminal via process of law. However, there is no basis for the attacker being ""Muslims who do not like Shia"", so since you make that assumption, it undermines your comment. So do lawful transactions with them and still the problem? Says a lot about your standards that you look past the group funding terrorism to blame the group buying their products and selling them items they've requested. No, Peter Pan, they mostly sell to China. They do it in dollars which benefits the US.  I'm saying you are wrong. Look to Saudi Arabia and Iran for your culprits.   Christians are fine and their wars against Muslims in various countries are justified even if war is hell.  You're just making things up because you want them to be true. And who is winning the gold in the olympics of killing civilians, in the name of their sky God in the last decade or so ? Quit being an apologist. In fact just go to an Muslim country and have a nice conversation about religion and let me know how it works out for you. [removed] The fact that the majority of attacks happen in unstable areas with internal conflicts and incredibly strained relations has nothing to do with it. OK, fair enough. It must just be the religion, without any external factors at all.   [Peaceful times](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2014/12/the_world_is_not_falling_apart_the_trend_lines_reveal_an_increasingly_peaceful.html); other sources available.  Islam is a religion, not a race. That isn't even a stereotype of white trash. Maybe inbreeding but muslims are far worse about that too. > Actually he was just asking a question. If you weren't so deluded with this fantasy world you've constructed you'd have noticed the question mark at the end of his sentence.  Isn't /u/nate_pepper secretly a death eater?  See? I used a question mark too! Quarantine asap. Then put them on notice that the next instance of major rule violation is a ban. If they do get banned, freeze new account registrations for 2 weeks and limit commenting with a timer for all IP addresses that have more than 2 accounts linked to them. Let the other subs ban the ones that won't assimilate and eventually most of the worst ones will be dealt with. It's not unthinkable that it would be ironic, but I think the established pattern of this happening thousands of times around the world indicates that it likely isn't irony.  Sucks for the innocent killed regardless. Source that this is a Sunni mosque? I read that it was an Ahmadi Mosque, and I know that Ahmadis take a lot of criticism from other sects which don't recognize their faith as ""true Islam"".  Sucks for all the innocent people killed regardless. ...and Dubya, John McCain, and the Pope.  The most damning thing I'm seeing is that he likes Rammstein, what a monster [removed] Yeah seriously ignore these racists shits. Was just in a comment thread where several people were saying both of them are Syrian refugees. What a depressingly dark time :( There's definitely a trend of the police waiting longer to call the motive of fundamentalist Muslim attackers than anyone else. It's so prevalent that it's like every third comment on Twitter when a terror attack starts trending.  By calling this racist, this observable pattern in police behavior, you devalue the word. Lol you think the guy named Mohamed isn't Muslim? Thinks people can't be white and Muslim. Only mentions white guys skin colour. Calls someone else racist.  Except they weren't muslim, so far it looks like it was one white quebecois anti-muslim, and a moroccan ex-muslim.  Canada has never been targeted by a refugee. In this attack it was by a white conservative, should we institute a total lockdown on all whites coming into Canada? Well speaking of narratives, there was only one shooter. The Moroccan was an innocent witness.   http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-city-mosque-gun-shots-1.3957686 it doesn't? I think you misunderstood my post.  I specifically said that it is basically the Arab language equivalent of ""Oh My God"" and is just as likely to be used by someone fearing for their life while being shot at, as it is to be used by someone Religiously motivated to carry out an attack. > Please explain how Allahu Akbar has anything to do with race.  It seemed to have plenty to do with it when the far right spent the last 12 hours telling us the fact that a Moroccan was questioned meant he is absolutely a Muslim terrorist, because his ethnicity somehow proved that, but at the same time Islam is totally not a race! I'm not, I'm saying it's racist to assume the Moroccan man was Muslim based on his nationality and that it is therefore a radical muslim attack. I clearly did not word that correctly. [removed] keep spamming pal. https://www.google.co.uk/amp/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN15E0F6  https://theintercept.com/2017/01/30/suspect-in-quebec-mosque-attack-quickly-depicted-as-a-moroccan-muslim-hes-a-white-nationalist/  This was done by a white supremacist  Sure sure but lets not forget [Quebec has a long standing history of separatist violence as well.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_de_lib%C3%A9ration_du_Qu%C3%A9bec) this is not something that was brought here by someone else.  Nothing has been officially released by RCMP. So because you haven't seen something happen it has to be the Muslim's. That's the most absurd thing ive ever heard.  They could have been anti Muslim trying to stir the pot knowing idiots like you will eat that shit up. People can say anything, it has absolutely no correlation  with their race or religion... You could just wait until the identities are released before doubling down. https://www.google.co.uk/amp/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN15E0F6  https://theintercept.com/2017/01/30/suspect-in-quebec-mosque-attack-quickly-depicted-as-a-moroccan-muslim-hes-a-white-nationalist/  This attack is an example as the shooter was white supremacist  I see jumping to conclusions worked well for you... The Quebecois accent is clearly different from the Maghrebi and Lebanese accent. Anyway, lets wait for the identity of the criminals to be released. The white supremacism theory is still the most believable, considering how far right groups are growing and how the city had numerous hate mongering radio shows, and considering the target. Anything is possible. However, [going by the statistics published by the CIA a few years ago](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mo.html), it is unlikely that it was a Christian Moroccan.  I agree that we need to wait for more information, though. One of the names is Mohammed Khadir  His name was fucking Mohammad.... Are you really this dense... Her father before her stood for president and was more openly racist, marine has learned to hide her racism behind anti immigration rhetoric.  Maybe it's because the western countries are more civilized?? That's super thin and doesn't even sound confirmed... maybe you should just wait for the cops to come out with motive. Alright. But my comment is still true. Yeah but this is different because reasons But, when a Muslim does an attack a lot of people say Muslims need to denounce it. It's possible this person is among that group.  No it's not hypocrisy, we will judge the right by the standards they use to judge others. You do not get to use the right's collective blaming to demonize minorities, and then shield yourself from criticism by hiding behind the left's standards. Actually he wasn't arrested on site, he called the police and waited for them under a nearby bridge and there where he said that he did it and they arrested him Thank you.^   Yes, our press is pretty good at this!!   Just one shooter, the Moroccan was a witness - http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-city-mosque-gun-shots-1.3957686 Thanks :) Must be nice to post all over Reddit all day for a paycheck. love you to reddit  It looks like the second suspect was in fact a witness and actually innocent. Yeah, I could uncharitably be described as anti-Islam, but also as anti-Orthodox-Judaism and none of that makes turning away refugees (as many countries, Canada included, did during the Holocaust) any more acceptable.  Legitimate apprehensions about integration, cultural conflicts, terrorism, etc do very little to free us from the weight of moral obligation nor will it save us from being rightfully condemned by history. The US also gives support to Kurds and moderate rebel groups that are full of terrorists.  He is not looking past the culprit, he's looking at the culprit**S**. Well, i'm sure the whole fact that the CIA help fund the Taliban and Al Qaeda (in full knowledge) is missed by you. The western powers have as much responsibility for the mess in Islamic world as much as political radicals imo. >Hawkeye: War isn't Hell. War is war, and Hell is Hell. And of the two, war is a lot worse.  >Father Mulcahy: How do you figure, Hawkeye?  >Hawkeye: Easy, Father. Tell me, who goes to Hell?  >Father Mulcahy: Sinners, I believe.  >Hawkeye: Exactly. There are no innocent bystanders in Hell. War is chock full of them - little kids, cripples, old ladies. In fact, except for some of the brass, almost everybody involved is an innocent bystander.  Examine a bit of the history of Iran. The UK and US had quite a hand in it.   >Christians are fine and their wars against Muslims in various countries are justified even if war is hell.   Even the one in Iraq and Yemen?   [The risk of terrorism in a broader perspective](https://ourworldindata.org/terrorism/#the-risk-of-terrorism-in-a-broader-perspective). Interesting breakdown of terrorist attacks.   Let's not forget [allied](https://airwars.org/) actions around the Middle East too. Although I don't know if they include [Shock and Awe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_and_awe#Casualties).  Action and reaction. A perpetual shitstorm.  [removed] Yes, the world by conventional metrics, but here we were talking about Islam's teachings which are in fact better reflected in the rise of asymmetrical warfare. Which is undeniably on the rise. I'm aware of that, that's exactly why I'm calling people racist, they're seeing an Arabic name and automatically assuming it means ""attack perpetrated by Muslims"" Pretty sure it's legal to fuck your farm animals in a lot of southern states. Do you not see your splitting of hairs? How do you know inbreeding is more for Muslims? Do you mean extremists who live in the mountains of Afghanistan? Or all 2 billion Muslims in the world?  Before you go telling people to rape a goat, go rape a 13 year old boy and call yourself a catholic priest. People are fucked in every corner of the world, and you deserve a good punch in the throat for being so disrespectful to billions of people. No, he's not. Death eaters aren't real.  See how easy that is. You don't need to go on an autistic tirade whenever someone asks a question. It's certainly evidence. But it's not very strong evidence, considering alternative explanations are easy to come up with. The fact that it's an ""established pattern"" also makes sense given that they were being ironic. It wouldn't be very ironic if it weren't an established pattern, after all.  Consider the evidence going the other way, like that it was an attack on a Mosque in the strip club capital of Canada. Or the pig's head that was left at the Mosque last year. Or that one of the attacker's facebook page has posts are pro-Christian, right-wing, and pro-Trump. These also have alternative explanations, of course (maybe it's a different person with the same name who happens to fit the profile. Maybe it's deep cover. Maybe the pig's head was someone else. Etc.)  I'm just saying, you've got to look at all the evidence, which is clearly a mess at this point. How? There's posts on reddit explaining it if you're interested, but finding examples is pretty tough if you don't speak Arabic. But only Trump, Le Pen, and Israel (his Facebook likes) have advocated violent war against all Muslims. This far right Islamophobic terrorist was just doing what the_Donald has been calling for every day. What's the matter, the right isn't interested in seeing patterns anymore? Hey now, Du hast is a classic. Years ago. All his more recent likes were far right. The only suspect Anexandre Bissonnette likes Trump and le pen.  You're forgetting that this is Canada, not America, and specifically Quebec.  In Quebec law you do not release the motives and names of the attackers until they stand trial in order to not taint public opinion and potential jurors if the accused opts for a trial by jury of their peers. This is not an observable pattern vis-a-vis American police behavioural patterns. Sure sounds reasonable hey.  This is exactly what I didn't say.  Now I'm just waiting for the customary line that says I'm a biggot or racist or something along those lines... don't worry, I'll wait.   Have any Countries been targeted by refugees?  Yup it's happened. That just has to be pointed out as well . Well you said the assumptions were racist. Is it that hard to understand that plenty of people hate islam but not the races that can partake?  I don't understand what you are getting at. A moroccan is most likely a muslim. He is certainly a terrorist. Logic would conclude that it was most likely a muslim terrorist.  lol I'm a SJW for calling people out for making innacurate statements based on racist assumptions that directly contradict the actual facts that have been released so far?  Ok there bud. Do the police have an SJW narrative to propagate?   There's only one shooter and he was the one associating with alt-right figures online and calling out 'feminazis' in his comments.  I never claimed it wasn't. I merely pointed out the flaw in the previous poster argument.  The 70s are over. I don't think separatists would have anything to gain from attacking a mosque. Granted, I don't know too much about the situation in Quebec but ETA in the Basque have always attacked police or military targets as far as I'm aware. Yes, but separatists target the government they wish to seperate from. Not some random Mosque. This isn't a wild Post hoc ergo propter hoc argument. There is a a great deal of historic evidence, and the attacker saying Allahu Ackbar, all eluded to the widespread sectarian violence in the Middle East finally arriving at North America shores. Reasonable conclusion, that was wrong.  Dozens mass killings with a total of  2,120 victims in 2015. More in 2016 but results not fully tabulated yet.  Would you like me to message you everytime I'm right over the next calendar year cause it's going to be several times per month.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Islamist_terrorist_attacks Reports are it's an Ahmadi Mosque. Ahmadis are pretty much the most hated minority to Muslims.   The Pakistani Constitution specifically discriminates against Ahmadis and disallows them from calling themselves Muslims and performing various Islamic practices. Are you talking about the Daily Beast piece that has already been retracted? Furthermore, other journalists are even saying they fell for fake news via a Reuters parody Twitter?   http://dailycaller.com/2017/01/30/daily-beast-falls-for-fake-news-on-quebec-mosque-shooting/ Occums Razor would suggest otherwise...  Oh and they just released the names:  http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-mosque-shooting-five-remain-in-critical-condition-following-attack  A Toronto Radio broadcaster said one of the assailants was of Moroccan origin, but both theories can still be true, I have a friend who's half Moroccan and half Tunisian and she looks 100% white to me, so might be a Moroccan white supremacist after all. Could be a covert like the two previous attacks, one of them is Moroccan. IDK how many far right christians called Mohammed exist in Morocco though.  True, but the fact that both were caught (with one calling the police on himself?!) leads me to believe that they weren't real Islamic terrorists. Every jihadist terrorist (in recent attacks) has been prepared to die in a blaze of glory - and did so. The only one that comes to mind that survived is the one Boston marathon bomber, but even then his brother died in the process.   Weird and tragic events, man. What does that report have to do with a Moroccan in Canada? Are you saying that because there are only ~380,000 Christians in Morocco, that statistically there's no way one emigrated to Canada at some point, as opposed to a Muslim? Perhaps, but considering a lot of them converted to Christianity in secret, and practice in secret due to fears of persecution by Muslims, I'm going to have to say there is a greater likelihood that a Christian would emigrate and then attack a Mosque than a fellow Muslim.  Still, I'm glad that we agree that we should wait for more information. It's so nice to have a civil debate with someone these days, at they seem few and far between. >But in breaking development on Monday, Quebec police said only one of the men was a suspected shooter and the **other was a witness.** Quebec media reported that [Alexandre] Bissonnette is the suspected shooter.    Let's wait for more info, shall we?   It's difficult to be dense with no info smart guy. Also:  >[But in breaking development on Monday, Quebec police said only one of the men was a suspected shooter and the other was a witness. Quebec media reported that [Alexandre] Bissonnette is the suspected shooter.](https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/quebec-mosque-attack-suspect-liked-trump-israeli-army-french-far-right)  Are you really this dense? Just wait for more info before you jump to conclusions. K.   Apples can be red.  Well seeing as Trump isn't Canadian how can this possibly be related to his administration? My point is that if you truly believe that, you are not better than far right. No he was actually just a witness Yes I've updated my other comments to reflect this, hadn't gotten to this one yet, thank you. If they were getting paid at least you could rationalize someone lying so outrageously. But no, these far right Islamophobes do it for free because they are pure evil and love to hate. This is what Trump has wrought. Seriously? It took you four days to think of that response? Yemen is a muslim war. Saudis are just incompetent and need help running it. Has nothing to do with Christendom.   Not sure what time frame you want to judge Iraq but Saddam  shouldn't have tried to switch to the Euro. Hines sight 20/20 I guess  We helped the Iraqi Kurds keep their land free from ISIS.     https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/667371059885301761 This is deep in the discussion, so I doubt anyone else used the downvote as it it just happened to hit 0 as you replied. Even though this is stimulating discussion. I never really get why people use it as a disagree button. Meh, that's by the by.  Culture influences behaviour as well as religion. Though some people find it very hard to distinguish the two. Christian teachings can be pretty brutal and the are examples of that in either the rhetoric of WBC, or the behaviour of the LRA. Societal conditions, brutal regimes, military actions, lack of education, limited resources, constant **perceived** threats (whether real or not), and other factors I can't remember right now have nothing to contribute to the situations, and it's all to do with the *teachings* of Islam? Of course, it seems silly to even think there could be other reasons.   That's why the majority of Muslims in Indonesia, Malaysia, Morocco, Niger are tearing themselves apart, and the millions of Muslims that live in Europe and North America have the countries involved in an internal bloody siege.   The Ukraine is asymmetrical warfare; the number of attacks happening in Europe and the US, which is **way** less than the UK suffered with the IRA, and the US suffered with homegrown terrorists in the 70's, is not.  You seem upset, grow up kid It appears you are either lucky to be un-jaded as yet, or you are willfully ignorant, or you are willfully diverting from the original commentor. I have yet to determine which of these you are.  There is a fourth option, that you are an exceptionally civil person willing to give the original commentor the benefit of the doubt. But that somehow appears slightly more unlikely due to the use of the words autistic, deluded and tirade. Wow, Canada/Quebec is retarded  Fair enough. That said, do you think that escaping that bit of context justifies calling someone a racist? I don't think ignorance of Quebec law while holding the belief that the police are often prone to sit on information more or less based on the motive in question, is sufficient. The police weren't being called racist, freemcflurry was. I think people should refrain from directly calling other people racist on such flimsy grounds. It's unnessicarily uncivil, and seems to shut down dialogue more than anything. Corporate papers are bad for buzzwords, but so are you. People are assuming that because ONE of the attackers is Moroccan, that this was a ""Terrorist Attack by Muslims"" when the police has yet to make any confirmations on the religion and motivations of the attackers. I'm saying it's racist to assume the attack was a extremist islamist one based on the fact that one attacker comes from a country with a sizeable muslim population.  Pretty sure were arguing the same point here but not quite on the same page. So Islam is not a race, but someone's race confirms they are Muslim without any other supporting information? That's what you're going with? [removed] Just making the point that this is not a new trend and shit like this has happened prior. Its not new because of [Insert Race/Belief Here].  Perspective is important. Never said they did but lets not pretend or be ignorant of the fact that attacks like this occurred historically without faith being a consideration. Back in the day we called those hate crimes. What historic evidence? I hear teens yelling this shit when setting off fire crackers and I don't think they are terrorists... I think it's just a widely known phrase for all people now Muslim or not  Do you really think it is reasonable to start making assumptions about an attackers race or religion hours after a horrific attack with absolutely no evidence? It's dangerous fear mongering and only leads to a overwhelming feeling of ""us and them""   You wanna talk about historical evidence? Throughout history there is always the unquestioning mass propagated into believing that there's ""us and them"" and this is what allows the suspension of empathy for what are people just like you and me.

How many of those mass killings were in Canada anyway? If you're going to use past statistics to work out who the most probable culprit is then Canada's history would point toward Sikh terrorists. Mainstream Islam attacking reform Islam? No. I did not see that. I speculated based on the prevalence of anti muslim rethoric and far right groups in the region. Unless the source is from the RCMP, its uncorroborated.  From the article you've been posting.  > The suspects, men in their late 20s and early 30s, were not known to police and the investigation into a possible motive continues, said superintendent Martin Plante of the RCMPs C Division.

That makes the story more complicated. Ill wait for more informations to come out to speculate more. >Alexandre Bissonnette and Mohamed Khadir.   So a Muslim guy and his retarded little convert?  If a far right attack is to happen in Quebec, it most likely wont be Christian. The province is rather nationalistic, but christianity is praticed only by a small portion of the population. Since the Quiet revolution, religion took the backseat in the province. > The only one that comes to mind that survived is the one Boston marathon bomber  Charlie Hebdo attackers  Brussels airport  Berlin market  Istanbul nightclub  Paris cafe & bars  It's an increasing feature, and the correlating factor seems to be that the attackers are either second generation, or European, and have perhaps absorbed some western influences that makes them want to stay alive >What does that report have to do with a Moroccan in Canada?  I'm saying that from a pure statistical standpoint, it is unlikely that any given Moroccan immigrant is Christian.  >Are you saying that because there are only ~380,000 Christians in Morocco, that statistically there's no way one emigrated to Canada at some point, as opposed to a Muslim?

I can understand this assumption, what with human nature wanting to strike out against those who resemble threats; personally I think that it is more likely to be Sunnis attacking a Shia mosque (or vice versa, although the number of Shia Muslims in Morocco is extremely small).  >Still, I'm glad that we agree that we should wait for more information. It's so nice to have a civil debate with someone these days, at they seem few and far between.  Agreed. Unfortunately, I won't be able to continue this debate as I have to leave for work. Thanks for being polite, though! Muslims don't come from the same country.  For the record, I don't think groups are obligated to denouce themselves whenever a person who identifies with that group commits a crime.  The guy who is currently the lead suspect is a Trump supporter, implying by the logic of those who say Muslims should denounce terror, that Trump supporters should denounce this act. And another 3 months to come up with this reply.    Slow and steady wins the race.  Coming from the toolbag who says things like ""go rape a goat"". Lmao. No wonder white women are leaving white men for that BBC. He was literally just asking a question, which is not surprising given the amount of speculation that was going on earlier. All you have to do is correct him so that he, and anyone else reading his comment, knows the truth. Yeah, but how easy is it to find a video of a guy almost getting hit by a truck, who happens to speak Arabic and happens to say Allah Ackbar? That's really difficult.  As for the takbir, [you might find this post by a Muslim on /r/combatfootage interesting](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/1elgnr/an_explanation_of_the_takbir_allahu_akbar/?sort=top) Pretty sure I remember it being shouted when the crane collapsed in Mecca. how is it retarded to not want to give the masses potentially false info? If by retarded you mean socially responsible, then yes. I think he was simply trying to point you away from using the word racist and toward using the word bigoted. It doesn't really matter though, context can tell anyone what you meant. How are statistics racist? If someone gets drafted to the NBA is it racist to assume they are black? Stats can't be racist. If someone blows up a shopping mall with a nail bomb suicide vest is it racist to assume they are muslim? Even though muslim isn't a race and no other religion blows people up for fun.  Nah, I just refuse to stand for racist bullshit.  But sure 'Albertacuckslayer', I'm sure you're the epitome of balanced and reasoned opinion. > Just making the point that this is not a new trend  Well citing things that haven't happened in 40 years seems a strange way to do that. Yelled Allahu Ackbar. I'm looking at dozens of cases of Muslims yelling this phrase before or during Mass attacks in the last 12 months. This is the first case of a non-muslim using this phrase as a red herring during a mass shooting.   You evidence is teenagers tell this phrase as a prank?   Is your contention seriously that there are NOT several dozen extremist sects within Islam committing crimes on a weekly basis? This is objectively false.   It is fair to defend the hundreds of thousands of more civilized Muslims from witch hunts and racism. It is dangerous to defend these radical elements hiding behind the veil of religion.   The Quebec guy called up to confess but Mohammed was just arrested at the scene. >So a Muslim guy and his retarded little convert?    https://www.google.co.uk/amp/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN15E0F6  https://theintercept.com/2017/01/30/suspect-in-quebec-mosque-attack-quickly-depicted-as-a-moroccan-muslim-hes-a-white-nationalist/  Muslims was a witness, the little convert as non Muslim white supremacist  People who knew dont give the portrait of a guy who converted himself. It could also be Khadir who embraced another ideology  Edit: Quebecois guy isnt a convert. Khadir is probably an ex muslim So not a single other North American attacker comes to mine? Interesting, I wonder if there is any correlation. I'm not reaching, as they have already said it was a single shooter - whose white-ish and Canadian. But hey, maybe he's a Muslim and from a Muslim country. I only said that we should wait for more information before making a determination. Why are you so determined to believe that there were two shooters, both of which have super Muslim names?  :edit: BAM! I love how all of the comments are now deleted. Someone's racism was showing! >I can understand this assumption, what with human nature wanting to strike out against those who resemble threats; personally I think that it is more likely to be Sunnis attacking a Shia mosque (or vice versa, although the number of Shia Muslims in Morocco is extremely small).    Definitely a possibility. Though as I noted in another post, it seems odd that both attackers survived and were caught (with one supposedly calling the police on himself...), because usually jihadist terrorists go out in a ""blaze of glory."" This is a very weird and tragic event.  Well, I hope you have a good and peaceful day at work fellow redditor. I also don't believe groups have to denounce themselves for the actions of the few but I'm sure if asked most Trump supporters definitely don't endorse these kind of actions. I have no qualms with that. Only your choice of words when you chastised another. Should Not be able to limit info like that  very easy to make people ""disappear""   Also people have a right to know  The Canadian police are not racist. The Canadian government is not racist. Canadian society is not racist. Canada has a feminist prime minister who justifies actions with 'current year'.  Sure, bigoted also works just as well, maybe I'll try to use that more in the future Forgetting that things have happened in the past is a good way for them to reoccur and overreact. How's that even close to conclusive evidence? Yet you continue to defend drawing your conclusions off it. If that's your way of thought obviously your not rational and I'm starting to believe dangerously deranged if you think you can defend that kind of hate mongering and witch hunting.   There was an attack and then shouted Allah Akbar ""they must be Muslim's hands down"" because other people arnt capable of that? Your either dumb or racist, possibly both and I don't have time to argue with people like that  I'm not disputing any of the actions any of the radicalized Muslim community commits. Only how quickly you are to associate hate and terror with them. The media gives you a target and you so quickly blame every world problem on them. Like I said you wanna talk historically, you are propagating the ""us and them"" mindset used throughout history to justify war I hadn't realised that you were viewing everything in the world through an exclusively American lens. I think perhaps you might be able to add Fort Lauderdale to your list then, although no one seems really sure what happened there Yeah, we are on the same page on denounciations. Its nice if the group as a whole doesn't endorse the actions, but I don't think they need to denouce every damn thing that is perpetrated by a member. Neither do most Muslims.   I think the initial comment was more due to the fact many Trump supporters believe in group accountability with Muslims than actual believing in it.  I'm not going to search through hours of Arabic YouTube videos to find examples of something I already provided evidence for. That's absurd to expect they also have a right to a fair trial (which they won't get if everyone already has their own idea of what happened because the media claimed to know what happened) Trying to connect totally unconnected events is pretty stupid.

The level of double-think going on here is astounding >Merkel 'explains' refugee convention to Trump in phone call  That sounds extremely pretentious, who is she to tell another world leader how to handle its borders? Especially with how that has gone for her country. Well, she is, after all, a veteran in dealing with refugees. It worked out so well for her.  Nobody minds legal immigrants I'd assume.

Because all those Muslims immigrants have done really well in Germany  fu merkel, you have blood of your own people on your hands there are a lot of good points here and i'd like to add one more. We don't answer to germany. They are free to enforce whatever policy they would like. well, as long as it conforms to EU guidelines. Not jumping to action every time another country doesn't like something we do does not make us nationalists.  The call to Trump took much longer than expected because Merkel voice was drowned out several times by the call to prayer from several nearby mosques in Berlin. /s The US has been the #1 destination for refugees for decades, hell, we have 11 million economic refugees. Most refugees in Europe are economic refugees who have passed through many safe nations.  Maybe Merkel can help us with our 11 million. Isn't there international anger over Merkel? The US can't be contained militarily, and as it doesn't currently have a State Department as such, diplomacy is a 404. # Culturally, a willing world can do a world of good.

It is not, at least today, a massive number of persons.  It's just one of those occasions where  one is too many. Notice all the fake news sites trying to conflate this ban with a ban on Muslims? Nowhere is Muslim mentioned in the ban. There was once a time when the Guardian was a reliable and fair source. Now it's just bias and fake news every day.

Also about criminal immigrants, you think the people the US got founded on where all saints? There was a fair share of religious nutters and people fleeing prosecution for real crimes and it still turned out allright. It's been like that for a while now. yeah NO ONE tells the Trumpster what to do. Especially not a world leader outside of the former USSR How about you look into the differences between IMMIGRANTS and REFUGEES?  These words are not to be used interchangeably. They mean very different things.  Who is letting in refugees unchecked? You realise there's a very lengthy vetting process right? A process that often prevents interpreters who have saved American lives overseas from coming to the country they helped. Nobody minds legal immigrants? Thats why Trump banned them too right? Including an Oscar nominee and a top athlete who even got awarded knighthood by the Queen.    >Nobody minds legal immigrants I'd assume.   Have you even *been* tp the US? Not everyone you let in is a sheep. Your own citizens themselves aren't sheep, as evident by the Orlando shooter.  In fact, most of our attacks are home grown terrorism yet this is never addressed. > allowing thousands of refugees into the country unchecked and free to disappear in an instant   This doesn't happen though. https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/11/20/infographic-screening-process-refugee-entry-united-states How exactly are un-vetted, undocumented refugees supposed to get into the US, though? The US is not like Europe; there is a big-ass ocean between Middle Eastern countries and the US that require plane or boat crossing, both of which have rigorous documentation requirements.  If people didn't mind legal immigrants then why did trump ban legal immigrants? So the German Chancellor explained the Geneva Convention to the US President?  Cry me a river /r/worldnews... Germany spent about 22 billion euro on refugees last year alone. Funnily enough that's about what Trumps wall will cost. But Trump pays it once, Merkel gets to pay it every year from now on and it will keep increasing as more migrants flood in next summer.  Sadly yes the one time when she got emotional it turned to a hughe shit show that breaks europe apart and set the founding stone of a police state Or to Comply with the constitution. Mostly yes with some bad sheep here and there. But unlike refugees in the US the refugees in Europe haven't been vetted. German here. Not all of them but 98%. I would say they have, when you think about the attacks on the refugee camps. A friend of mine called Omar, came to Germany from Senegal, (it's a secure state atm), and he came here because his mother and father were both killed in the civil war there. So now he has a small brother and noone to take care of him. So what would you do? try to leave the country to support your little brother? Would you calmly think about your next step or would you grief for your parents and try to help your brother?  They are literally *all* doctors and engineers, you bigot. They've greatly improved Germany as a result! *sigh* Centuries, not decades. Why do you think people left Europe for america? Because they where so happy and rich, had such great employment that they wanted to start at zero to experience hardship again?  Economic refugees founded your nation. There is American anger on reddit. That's about it.  For what? No. Only a vocal fragment of the US spills shit all over the place on Reddit all the time. Most anger is directed towards the Great Orange Leader at the moment. He likes to get all the attention. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/29/trump-asked-for-a-muslim-ban-giuliani-says-and-ordered-a-commission-to-do-it-legally/?utm_term=.83f0d65be54e  I honestly wouldn't blame you if you called Rudy Guiliani fake news since he's so senile. But this is part of the Muslim ban. Why not ban Saudi Arabia. Osama bin laden and a majority of the 9/11 attackers were Saudi. If it's not a Muslim ban, why are Christians give priority? I know right, he's such a slow learner. It's the president's job to know this stuff already. Unfortunately we elected someone with the intellectual capacity of a five year old. So international leaders have to explain simple concepts in tiny words very slowly for him. Well who else is going to do it ? It's the job of his advicers, but his advicers are shit and the last time you had a President with shitty advicers you invaded Irak and destabilized the entire middle east.  I wonder whose job that would be. And why that person doesn't seem to do that well. Then it is such a shame it had to be done, isn't it? Well, they are not the catastrophe the average worldnews or pol poster things it is. It's a small annoying cost factor but doesn't affect the average person. The US had more succesfull islamist terrorist attacks over the last few years than Germany so even there we are not doing that bad considering the risk we have exposed our selfs to.  An idiot with a Phd in nuclear chemistry that has managed to stay in power through democratic elections for 12 years. What have you to show? maybe he could try and explain how not to get your citizens to constantly shoot up schools or clubs or colleges or to stop rapes in america...i mean it works both ways right ? Yeah, if trumps travel ban of 7 countries has the same effect as invading two and bombing six or seven others for over a decade has the same effect, we should do a full stop on immigration from mid east immediately.  Where is your Phd in nuclear chemistry, european peace prize, 12 years in power and orders of merit by a dozen countries?  what kind of education do you hold mister ''smart guy''?  So, is Russia never going to be trustworthy, and we should have nukes aimed on each other forever because they were the USSR?  In the words of Obama, the 1980s called, they want their foreign policy back. How do you determine the difference between the two without adequate records? or when they arrive with no identification or documentation?  It seems to me that refugees are trying to seek safety (plenty of nearby safe countries) while economic migrants shop around europe for the country with the best social safety net. What's the difference between a refugee and an economic migrant? > Who is letting in refugees unchecked?  The EU. They let the Tsarvaevs in. Considering one of them was named ""Tamerlane"", somebody dropped the ball on that one. Stop peddling shit. Mo Farah is a British citizen and can still travel to the USA.   http://m.bbc.com/sport/athletics/38788910 Roman Polanski raped a 13 year old girl after drugging her at Jack Nicholsons house. He won a golden globe award while overseas waiting out the statute of limitations. Movie makers are all good.  Oscars are crap these days, can't even nominate Amy Adams. The wording on the eo was poor and adjusted.  109 of the 109 affected people were granted entry after delay.  People have spent longer in airports due to weather delays. His father was a refugee. Had he never been allowed into the US (considering how outspoken he was in support of the Taliban, he definitely shouldn't have been,) those 50 people spending their Saturday night at the Pulse nightclub would still be alive. Because home grown terrorism can never be stopped. That's a fact. Any country can have anyone snap at any time. Unless they're blogging about it on Facebook before hand in 100% of the cases, it'll never stop There is this totally unscientific saying that about 5% of people are flat out psychotic in some way, regardless of upbringing, parents disposition or genetic factors. Its just a twentysided dice roll and if its a 1, BAM, psycho. Just something different in their brain.  Now not all of them get violent in the criminal sense, but we all know someone crazy thats just way out there doing things that are wrong. Sometimes its horribly emotional abuse bordering on torture of partners or children, and sometimes its killing people.  Thing is its not certain people or races that are evil, but in some countries the 5% rule or are religious leaders, and boy do they like surrounding themselves with likeminded people.   If you just take a random amount of 100 people from anywhere in the world, treat them well and be friendly to them, the vast majority of them you will find to be decent people. Though it is possible to indoctrinate people to hate certain other people, it won't be in their nature. Largely, sure.  They couldn't find the Orlando shooters wife for what, 2 months?   Doesn't mean it doesn't happen It's more amusing than upsetting. Thank god she isn't my country's leader. You can't be fucking serious.   If you are stupid enough to think the wall is a one time payment, you shouldn't be comparing. The wall will quickly increase in its annual cost to maintain. It's a fucking concrete wall for a few thousand miles. It's not a garden fence.   Also refugees to Germany and Western Europe have declined in numbers, so there is that as well.   Or are we going to peddle ""alternative facts"" just because you can't comprehend the truth? The money we are giving to refugees by now is basically a stimulus package for the german economy. Those refugees aren't hoarding their money in the bank, they are spending it on groceries and other basics. Maintenance and repairs are not for free. 1. Walls require upkeep  2. A wall is nearly worthless without the manpower to actually guard it.  In what world does the wall not need to be maintained at all?  > But Trump pays it once  I guess maintenance and staffing are free then? > Or to Comply with the constitution  Was Obama's immigration ban unconstitutional? Ah yes, Article I of the US Constitution:  >Everyone on Earth has the Constitutional right to come live in the United States  It's like he hasn't even read the Constitution! Sorry ? What clause is he not complying with .. exactly ? Are they doing well though? Serious question because I'm hearing massively mixed reports.  [removed] Tell that to the families of the people who got murdered at the Christmas market and to the girls that have been sexually assaulted at New Years celebrations.  I assume this is satire. Yep, french here. Everytime I see anger against germans on Reddit, I assume it's someone from the US. Many times I checked before, and that was it. It is trully weird.  If it really was a Muslim ban, why wouldn't Trump, at the very least, ban the countries where a majority of the Muslims live?  Yet, a Syrian Christian would be banned and a Turkish Muslim would not. Not much of a Muslim ban! Sure, I'd agree. It has flaws, to be sure. cause trump has property and businesses there, he started like eight separate businesses in saudi arabia *during his campaign*. Because they're being specifically targeted by ISIS and the rebel groups for discrimination and persecution along with the yazidis and other non-muslim religious groups in Syria They're not, as far as I'm aware. That's something that may be implemented after the temporary ban. You don't see Christians detonating explosives strapped to themselves in crowded places very often do you? they *might* be after the review, because of that genocide thing going on.  Well then you should easily be able to beat him in the next election right? Anybody would beat a five year old right? Ive seen a pic on Twitter today - a woman (I think from Scotland) holding a sign: ""Id call him a cunt... But he lacks both depth and warmth."" Well. Simplyfying a bit here on the power a president wields?  Invading Iraq was both approved by the Sentate and the Congress. Tell that to te people killed by the truck. Tell that to the raped girls. Just look at the country she is leading, many of her own people are sick of her policies. I don't see how that qualification helps her in running a country, please advise?   [removed] I don't think I ever said any of that. Please don't project so much. Refugees are defined and protected under International law. If you are really interested in learning here is a UNHCR paper on it. http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html A refugee is being offered the legal ability to live in another country because his / her home country is physically unsafe. There is an expectation that the status is temporary, and most will eventually go back to rebuild once whatever happened is over. An economic migrant seeks legal status for career opportunities in another country, and the other country extends this as a gesture of goodwill and because having foreign workers benefits the economy of that country. There is no particular expectation on whether that person eventually becomes a citizen or not, but there is an understanding the relationship can be suspended whenever it stops benefiting one party, unless that person has been offered some sort of permanent legal status.  There are various other treaties, etc, but since international law isn't enforced in any meaningful way, the actual difference comes down to the actual word's meanings. The difference between someone running for his life and someone going to an amusement park. Well it is kinda hard to check so many km of borders and land. US is in the nice place becouse they have 2 fucking oceans that refugees have to pass. And airports and sea ports are preety good chokepoints where you can easly check anyone coming in(ok harder in sea ones.)  Question: How many attacks have been linked to refugees? I agree that the vetting process is not robust enough. America closing its borders will make it even harder. They were from Chechnya originally, no? And were in their teens when they moved to America. So how would you alter the vetting process to avoid this? Would you ban people named ""George"" because they're named after several different leaders who all pursued murderous wars and genocides?  Until only yesterday though, it wasn't the case. Because if you hold dual citizenship, including one of those countries, then it auto blocked you even if you were British. Happened to one of my friends who is dual.  Fuck offfffffff this apologist shit is irrelevant Roman Polanski can't enter the USA without getting arrested. He's a fugitive and a convicted pedophile. What does that have to do with anything? How does that have anything to do with this-your saying it's justified that he can't enter the US because of Roman Polanski? What the fuck is wrong with your movement, it's like this is just a game-  None of you seem to really care about the world around you, whether that's true or not that's how you've been acting.    Using that logic, Trump can't be trusted because Nixon broke the law or something.  Ben Affleck was in Gigli yet is still allowed to make films in the United States And Poland is cooperating in almost every war US starts. Guess who still need visas! POLAND. Recruiting somebody who is successful, financially well-off and dedicated to their job to be a terrorist sure sounds a lot harder than recruiting some random person that has lost everything they had due to western interference in their country.  Nobody is saying that stars and VIPs never do bad things, but it seems obvious that they are less likely to let everything they have go up in flames to kill a couple of people than somebody who simply doesn't have anything.   If their professional success meant so little to them, it's likely they wouldn't even have that success in the first place. That's only for green cards, vetted and accepted refugees and people with visa are still denied entry. Trump's order was an immigration ban from those countries. Let's, repeat that: ALL IMMIGRATION. Refugees were affected, but plenty of other legal immigrants including permanent residents and students.  *A president should know how to word his orders.*  Is that supposed to make me feel better?! That's literally one of the most important parts of the job.  How long? 20 hours without food? 33 hours? Presidents should understand how important wording is is law. How?  Shouldn't his father have shot up the nightclub then? My point is that this is a slippery slope, at what point are the degrees of separation ridiculous?  Timothy McVeigh killed the most people. If his great grandparents didn't immigrate here from Europe all those years ago then all those people would still be alive. If planes didn't exist then 9/11 never would've happened.   At a certain point we have to think about why these people are being radicalized and why it's happening to American citizens. > Had he never been allowed into the US (considering how outspoken he was in support of the Taliban, he definitely shouldn't have been)  That's awfully impressive of him, considering he was admitted into the US in 1986, and [the Tablian didn't exist until 1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban).   Unless you're talking about him having ties to the Afghan resistance, in which case you might want to remember that the Mujhadeen were US allies at the time. Try re-watching Rambo 3 - it came out in 1988, so that'll give you some idea of how people saw the conflict at the time.  the equivalent of if birds didn't fly I wouldn't have bird shit on me so lets control the airspace and that way i can avoid this happening, GROUND ALL BIRDS  So instead of trying to do anything at all about the real problem you spend money and political capital on something completely unrelated and affects less than a percentage of Americans?   I'd rather have her for the next 100 years than have Trump for a day. Merkel to Trump: ""Repeat after me, Wir schaffen das... "" No, because there wasn't a ""refugee ban"" in any remotely similar way. http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/01/30/sorry-mr-president-the-obama-administration-did-nothing-similar-to-your-immigration-ban/ Is Obama the current President?  If the answer is no, this is what we like to call a Tu Quoqe fallacy, period.  edit: Ah, sweet downvotes for pointing out shoddy logic.  Stay classy, r/worldnews If you read my reply, I quoted both parts of the Constitution that he has bypassed - potentially as it is yet to be heard by the legislature.  By accepting foreign payments:  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-us-president-constitution-violate-accept-fireign-payments-russia-a7540951.html  First Amendment's Establishment clause  which prohibits the establishment of a national religion by Congress and the Due Process clause, which safeguards against arbitrary denial of life, liberty, or property by the government outside of the law.  http://uk.businessinsider.com/trumps-extreme-vetting-order-may-violate-the-constitution-2017-1  Two enough in the first week? I met with a few refugees here. Like literally refugees from Syria.   They are sturggeling. They get some money and houseing, German lessons if they are lucky, but than they are required to compete for jobs against everyone else.  Not to mention that they are housed in small cities and villigies outside of the Major cities, and dont get free mass tranpsortation tickets.  The guy who cam to our Office to learn how we work, paid from his small monthly goverment allowence a good 2-3% just to come in and leanr from us. It's stupid.  An engineer from Syria will not get a job as an engineer in a Million years. They have to be payed at least minimum wage by law, and any Company would rather have a Student from a University as a Praktikant for half the price and much better cultural education than a Refugee.  They are almost always in an impossible situation.  I dont know what the solution is, im just saying that i have seen how hard some of them try just to be set up for failure. Not Europe but where I live the refugees just suck up welfare and complain their children have to do stuff like swimming lessions with boys and girls. Generally yes. There are certainly some problems when you hab a big number of people with no jobs in some places. And there are a few cases where refugees committed really bad crimes, these are the ones you probably heard about in international media. In the big picture crimes have not risen significantly but the whole situation costs a shit ton of money. That is two people. Out of millions. What should I call them, representatives? The average Muslim? They are terrorist scum and do not deserve to be made bigger than the trash they are. Ahhh it wouldn't be /r/worldnews without a non-german complaining about the state of Germany. Given your crime stats, the US is far worse in protecting citizens then almost any other western country. Do you even think before you type your bullshit? The backround to the picture you posted totaly checks out! /s They don't matter they aren't brown or muslim. We have a competent leader, they have the annoying orange. I've gotten it from my American host family as well. It was kinda funny how all of their arguments went back to ""But she's a woman! She can't do politics!""   It's funny how this is pretty much the opposite of how things were last century. Guiliani says that it was done as a legal method of banning Muslims.  > I'll tell you the whole history of it, Giuliani responded eagerly. So when [Trump] first announced it, he said, 'Muslim ban.' He called me up. He said, 'Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.' ""  ...  > And what we did was, we focused on, instead of religion, danger  the areas of the world that create danger for us, Giuliani told Pirro. Which is a factual basis, not a religious basis. Perfectly legal, perfectly sensible. And that's what the ban is based on. It's not based on religion. It's based on places where there are substantial evidence that people are sending terrorists into our country. It isnt even a ban. It is a 90-day moratorium on entry for people from the 7 countries. And a 120-day moratorium on admission of refugees from any country. Obama had a 60-day moratorium on Iraqis entering in 2011 and nobody batted an eyelid.  Or because they have a stable government that is willing to work with ours.  Trump himself said that Christians will be given priority. Not sure how or why people keep denying what their dear leader says all the time.. Well, if we're playing the ""let's paint everyone with a broad stroke"" game, I would reply they're too busy burning mosques, shooting up schools and doing crystal meth. Sire if anti-intellectualism and pride in ignorance wasn't such a high part of the red states.  There are more people dying from falling of beds, then from terroristattacks? Should we ban beds?.   And there are more terrorist attacks from non-muslims.  The truck was driven by a tunisian, not a refugee. He would have been in germany regardless of merkels policy since he immigrated illegally to italy years before that. Bosten bomber, Malibu Night Club, Ford Hood? What is your source on that? Americans on reddit? Because Germany loves her.  Besides the far-right (who are not very liked in Gremany #Understatment) most people agree with her policies. Even people who identify as left/anti-facsist agree that what she is doing is great in regards to human rights, even with her being a right-centrist. It baffels me that the internet seems to think Germany doesn't like her.  Unemplyment at an all time low, wages rising the fastest in years, her party while not as strong as 4 years ago is still stronger than the next two parties and the only scratch on her track record was being tricked by Orban into letting 800k illegals enter the country.  > many of her own people are sick of her policies  And she still beats Pres. Trumps approval rates.. shocker! hiren03 be so dumb dumb Why refer to Russia as   >the former USSR  Then? Our relation with the USSR was only ever nukes aimed and finger on the trigger, if you're referring to them as the USSR, what else could you be insinuating? I feel like this is the exact argument for a southern border wall. Whats the point in a statistic like that? Is someone even a refugee if he is traveling to another country with the intent to attack it rather than fleeing conflict? Sounds more like a combatant to me.  The thing is we have to protect refugees, unless your from north korea or some few other places your government signed that into law after WW2.  >vetting process  Can you walk?  Welcome to Sweden! vetting process ?        Europe has not vetted any of its migrants u fool  But Farah is only a british citizen so it was misleading from the get go.  How the fuck would they know you have dual citizenship?  I have dual citizenship and I would just not show my passport of the banned country. Like seriously, how the fuck would they know you have it? If one of them are bad the rest has to be bad too. Welcome to new world. >Using that logic  The lesson for both is to be wary of government overreach and to pay attention. A democracy functions best when its citizens participate. Thank you! Someone is finally talking about the real issues here. >  Let's, repeat that: ALL IMMIGRATION    Um no, they're allowed in if they're a persecuted minority group. Lets go a step further. Ask by whom they are being radicalized and wether there are governments supporting it in some way. Good for you. I mean that sincerely. I'm glad we both have the leaders that we want. So move to Germany. I think that would be a win for everyone.  > Ah, sweet downvotes for pointing out shoddy logic.  No, the shoddy logic is the fake outrage regarding Trump, while not a peep from the media was made about Obama. Nothing about Trump's executive order is unconstitutional. How can he keep getting away with this shit? Does nobody care? It's not quite that simple. That clause is not about accepting foreign payments, it's about accepting bribes. These are completely distinct things.     As for establishment, I've already covered that. It does not apply to foreign nationals *not* within our borders. That's why the article hedges with the weasel word *may*. They know it doesn't but they want to sell copy and playing to outrage is a good way of doing it. I looked into what a syrian electrician would need in terms of qualifications to  work here in the UK. Its not far off the whole course. When you bare in mind I have young British lads working for me who have to spread the course over 2 years to simply afford doing it in the first place not to mention the language, maths and physics we needed. Then there is the work ethic and social aspect to Europe working environments. I've seen too many people from that area of the world not last a single morning labouring. We use eastern Europeans. They work forever. If Germany is anything like the UK you can count out construction or trades tbe odds are stacked in everyway.   To be fair to them. I would face many of the same barriers in the middle East.  The solution is likely to solve the crisis at their home so that they at least have the option to return to their old lives. Only other option that i see is for them to disseminate among Germany / The EU and hope that their children and further generations can integrate into the society.  Most of reddit are complaining but they have zero idea of what it's like when over a million Muslims come to live in your city as has happened in my lifetime. Yes. Some are great but the reality is most live a different existence and tensions occur. We even segregate our children for fuck sake. Is that the future we want? [removed] Frankly this is getting ridiculous. We need to fix that subreddit. The altright has turned it into a nonsensical shithole. Try to have a discussion and you'll be harassed and bullied by people inciting hatred with baseless claims, this shouldn't fly. [removed] >kinda funny how all of their arguments went back to ""But she's a woman! She can't do politics!""  For some odd reason, I doubt that. So... still not a muslim ban, but the closest thing to it they could get legally. (Psssst, you might not have heard, but the US was in a [declared war with Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War) when Obama did that) Will. That's the future tense you are using. Do you not understand tenses or what? you tried I'll translate what Sc2MaNga is trying to say  ""Why are you mad I'm for increasing your chances of dying from X when you're more likely to die from Y?"" More people sleep than there are Muslims. Sleeping is a necessary part of human existence, we can at least try to do something about terrorism. I'm not American for a start, my username might have given you a clue, no not all Germans love her actually.Many are becoming disillusioned with her stance on free movement and the crisis of immigration, Google it, you will find many sources. Sorry,I don't see how that is relevant to the qualification that you posted, please explain as you were the one that stated the qualification was in some way relevant. Was it a qualification in finances? I am struggling to see your logic here, I hear what you are saying but you are not answering the question I asked you over the claim you made. 800000 isn't much really is it?   Also, how are they illegals if she let them in? I think I need a lobotomy, that might allow me to follow what you are saying!.   Sorry, is that the discussion? I'm not american and choose not to vote in the country in which I reside, thanks for your input. Thanks bro hope you feel better The US has a Mexican *refugee* problem? First I've heard of it. I think the number of attacks by refugees is very relevant to the danger posed by refugees.  I think you're confused. My understanding is that no terrorist attacks have been linked to refugees. I am firmly pro refugee It is only partially misleading. The fact is many people would have both nationalities. It's ridiculous that people would have had to renounce their citizenship, even though they arguably have 'proof' that they are no threat by possessing citizenship of an allied country. It was a valid concern to have.  edit: Wasn't aware my suggestion was inflammatory enough to get down voted like that! Could even be a variety of factors that play into it. As we all know, they have an awful lot of data who goes in and out of the country.  I just want to say two words. Jennifer Lopez. I think it's a mix of incendiary rhetoric from the GOP and economic distress. I wouldn't say this is government ""support"" though. I'm German and thank what ever deity there is for that :D So people shouldn't try to fix their own country, they should just flee to another country when things go not to their liking at home? How can you be so sure you want him to move out of your country without knowing if he's white or not? People moving to Germany is exactly the problem here. Not fake outrage, real outrage. And claiming that being outraged about Trump has anything at all to do with Obama is a tu quoque fallacy, plain and simple.   If you can't defend Trump without whataboutism then it's better to just stay silent. That or you're going on record to say Obama had good policies and I'd rather not give you a heart attack. Republican majority. They'll never do anything to hurt their candidate even if it means selling out all the ideals the US was founded on.   All that counts to them is that they are calling the shots for the next 4 years. The only way to punish the president is by impeaching him it is all or nothing. And only the congress can impeach a president. Its usually not the qualifications they lack but 1000 other stuff you take for granted.  - Cultural expriance is sooo fucking huge! People dont understand, how different our whole scocity is compared to their's. this poor bloke from Syria had no idea how to behave in a Meeting and an interview. It was just so hard to watch him try to interact with People in an Office Setting. Than a small kid, the son of one of the employees came in. The guy smiled at the boy and brushed his hair in a silly Little ""where you going little buddy"" manner. I shit you not, the air froze.  - languange.... they dont speak german or english. Its over at that Point.  - german laws. Not even building codes, and such, just Basic german laws.   - Geography and history. They dont know which City is where, what is Close to what. And have no idea how and what those cities used stand for or interact with each other.  - even basic small talk ettiqutte is lost on them. It takes a Life time to become funny/ interesting or even just a good listener in any given language. even bad talkers know some of the all time classics, ""how is the weather"", ""did you see the game yesterday"" etc..  this list could go on forver..  Yep, the fucking university... UNIVERSITY in my city decided to segregate certain activities at summer camp next summer because the Syrians wouldn't let their children attend the summer camp unless it was segregated. I can't believe a university would give in to segregation. If you don't value equality you can go straight back to fucking Syria. I'll tell you from my experience. I'm a first generation born US citizen to immigrant parents. My dad fully embraces US culture and is probably as American as anyone with an accent. My mom is stubborn as fuck, and talks about all the time how much Communism was better and never wants to fully associate with anybody but Europeans. She's been here since 1991, my Dad since 1984. There's going to be immigrants that will integrate, but there will be A LOT that will struggle, or refuse to integrate. People think it will take a few years...no it could take DECADES, and we're just Christian Europeans who could relate to Americans. Muslim immigrants who have different values and beliefs, and raised differently compared to Western citizens won't be much easier.  You know what's even higher? The number of non-Muslim rapists, murderers and thieves. But I still also call them black sheep. So you think Germany has descended into a free-for-all full of raping and murder? I'd be willing to bet you're on the wrong side of the atlantic to make that judgement. Like someone else said, that's just not the case:  >Unemplyoment at an all time low, wages rising the fastest in years, her party while not as strong as 4 years ago is still stronger than the next two parties  But of course, keep pushing the 'Germany is literally hell' narrative to further the scare mongering. Most germans do as well, thats why we voted her into office 3 times in a row. Really? When was this war declared and by whom? hes trying to say that the terrorist threat is (excluding 9/11) a small statistic in annual death rates, ie: more people die from car crashes (caused by drunk drivers)than terrorist attacks... or you could see the military death toll of soldiers in Iraq vs 9/11 and see which caused more deaths. I understand its the easy way to see things, i tend to go down that slope at times (refugees = terrorism) but lets try to put things in a real perspective. Oh, please. How could you question the love (or hate) of the people for a politician when Reddit predicted with fair accuracy that Hillary was a landslide victory? Everyone clearly hated Trump more, so it was obviously Hillary. *Psst*. Lobotomy for someone brain death?  Well it matters very little if you are American or not, you are still spewing proper nonsense.  Stop playing dumb. [removed] Central americans and Mexicans, yes. Are we talking about real attacks or imaginary ones? Real danger or imaginary danger? Should we stop letting in americans because they might commit a crime aswell(considering the US has the highest jailrate per 1000 people they seem predisposed to crime)? Totally agree with that. I do believe that the world needs to debate islam and it's place but this policy is knee jerk shit and poorly thought through. Extremely poorly. That said I saw a graphic in my hotel room last night which reported that more Americans were for than against. Don't know how true it was.  Sounds like a made up liberal story to push their anti trump narrative. >Breaking: German is happy to be part of superior nation.  :V This post is hate speech and hate speech is a crime in Germany. Well that's great news. Enjoy your leader haha.  You post this on an article about a refugee crisis? You get the hypocrisy right? Its really not. We are doing good, better than most atm. Name one country with a similar or greater population than germany that has less crime or conflict. Maybe Japan, but they still like to off themselves more than anyone so they can't be that happy. Fallacy fallacy, just because an argument makes a fallacy doesn't mean it is null and void. There was no media outrage at Obama. There is about Trump, and this executive order uses a list from a few years ago. So why the outrage now? [removed] > Not fake outrage, real outrage.   I'm afraid you've been duped by fake news. We vote again for the House and Senate in two years, I believe. Would anything change if at least one of those got Democratic majority? I remember one article here, an interview with a refugee. He was from some mountain village, and had never seen an uncovered woman's head before. It's easy to forget how important and different culture can be, especially when we keep getting the ""all people, all cultures are the same"" narrative drilled in on a daily basis. The entirety of your list can be fixed in a few months if work is seriously put in it.   Honestly, if you gonna refuse someone a job for being overly friendly to a child... Its not that bad. We had a lot of turkish in the 1970s, much more than we have syrians now, and it turned out alright. Ofc its not always easy, but its not the end of the world either. And in the end i rather enjoy living in a multicultural country.   Some say thats what has made the US great, the influx of so many different people and ideas.   Here in germany most people don't forget that our darkest time wasn't when we let the italians in, or the turkish, the poles or russians. It was when we where all alone among ourselves. In those 15 years we committed more violence and crime to ourselves and others than in all the time since have been committed by foreigners and germans together. Try to look at the percentages and you'll see muslims in many European countries are overrepresented in the statistics.  This might be a bit difficult since countries like Sweden stopped reporting these statistics because the facts were racist :) I actually don't think that's true   Unless you count African Americans.  Was that your goal? Racist. I am born here and live here in Germany. Not much special going on here. We don't have kids shooting around in schools, we have really good & almost free school system - even university fees are only like 250 per 6 months (""semester"") and when he get hurt or have problems with our teeth/skin/mental stuff, we go to the doctors/hospitel and don't get broke even when you are just a student with really low income. I love living here in Germany. And I am proud that we are able to help out, welcome and integrate so many people from around the world. they bring all their different and interesting cultures with them and (as the statistics clearly show) are friendly and do less criminal stuff then native German citizens. Also, we have really good private data protection laws here in Europe - our personal health/insurance/telecommunication/political data doesn't get all stored and sold off by the big companies without our agreement. American here, dont listen to the other guy, the alt-right (aka silver league) has been getting really uppitty lately, he probably reads breitbart. http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35231046  In 2003 by the US Congress. Yea, that's fine.  I'm still saying, I'd rather not increase the rate of terrorist attacks just because I'm more likely to die in a car crash.   Please try writing in English,I may understand you better. Sadly I only understand 1 language. Bells with whistles on, we the left have to be correct unless you disagree with us, then you are wrong, typical liberal lmao. #fuckallliberalsmindyoutheymightenjoyit I think that is you lot. We don't have a freaking refugee program. We implement the UN Refugee convention we have signed in 1951 alongside most civilzed nations of the world.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_Relating_to_the_Status_of_Refugees  There it is. If you don't agree with it your certainly in nice company.  Entirely depends on the sample that was used. And of course, where the graphic came from, heh.   It's overall an obscene over reaction to try and fix a problem that doesn't really exist. People should be more afraid of lightning than being the victim of terrorism. Which is also odd because the ones who are for the controls are often not the ones living in the places that would be the targets, aka main cities.   And as we all know, this ban is utterly useless to combat Islamic extremism, if the main perpetrator isn't included in the list. It's purely for show. Well I can understand my anonymous anecdote is technically impossible to believe with any certainty. But what you just said sounds like you can't trust a thing regardless.   It seems like you took my anecdote like a personal attack on your reality.   edit: Now that I checked your comment history I'm not surprised! Red pill and trolling Anarchists is telling. *arrested* Sure buddy. There is a difference between staying to fix a state, and trying to get out of a war zone. > Fallacy fallacy, just because an argument makes a fallacy doesn't mean it is null and void.   Welp, looks like you're living in your own reality.  What consistent positions? What position have I held previously that's inconsistent with my current one? ""Alternative Facts"" Most of the seats that are getting voted on are currently Democrat-occupied, so mathematically it's unlikely. Then again, so was Trump. I have spent 13 years in Germany and still am not fluent enough to write my reports without the help of a secretary. Are you saying that I'm just especially dumb compared to an average refugee for needing 1-2 years to learn a good enough German? Not to mention that I was young back than. Imagine haveing to learn that shit at 30+  You can learn a language in a few months? I'm not talking about enough for a grocery trip. I'm talking about meetings and such. On top of that, changing your mannerisms isn't easy. I really try not to slouch but find myself continuously doing it. Imagine trying to overcome something like that with other things such as eye contact. When I was in high school still I remember my German teacher telling me that Turks all came over to Germany after WWII to help rebuild the country again and many of them stayed. Interesting story, I don't know if its true, I'd assume so if there were many in the 70s as you said. But it's true though, we have a lot of great things from multi-cultural societies, America was built on British, French, German, Irish, Italian immigrants and then later on Black(slavery), Japanese, Chinese immigrants and so on. It's a process, its a long process at times too, and there can be problems along the way that need solutions or actions. We don't really have problems with Muslims all that much here, most of them (in Ohio at least) are Palestinians. I don't know how that would compare to Syrians. However, the integration process is always the most difficult part normally. Overrepresentation still doesn't mean big representation. The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful people like me and (hopefully) you. Therefore the criminals are black sheep. It's really not that hard. I don't think there is many African Americans here outside of military bases. If I made you think of that that makes you racist and even more stupid. Yeah you're not wrong Yep I'm aware. Yet the German people aren't in outcry and it's not a no-go zone like you're pretending. The only people I've heard complain are Americans  Weird how wiki denies that then.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war_by_the_United_States#Declarations_of_war Not only this, but the fact that people die from falling off the bed don't create social instability. These attacks have a face and a ideology, people keep denying it but it's clear as day for everyone, and so much as the media and government of some countries try and hide it, people will grow much more confident that they're not being shown the full picture and so will make their own conclusions, often misguided by propagandists of the other side. When you compare dying from falling off the bed and victims of terrorism, you're ignorant of the populace and how people behave in a society. Lobotomy for someone brain death like you?  Better? You probably don't even know what a liberal is and keep confusing the term with everything leftist though..  > we the left have to be correct unless you disagree with us, then you are wrong  What are you even trying to say here? Lets make an assumption - I am correct. You disagree with me. If I am correct then you are wrong. That is standard. Your statement is entirely redundant.   Also, that hashtag is a fucking eyesore. Let me break it down for you.  When you turn over your passport to immigration, they do not search a database to find out if you a citizen of the 200 other nations on the planet.   So if you are a dual citizen, don't show the passport of the banned country. They have no way of knowing that you have 2 passports. As you like to spout ""fallacy"" all the time, you fell victim to one of your own, which is what /u/Capn__Morgan was trying to highlight: https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/the-fallacy-fallacy [removed] I know quite a few people who spend years here and didn't learn the language properly (PHD students/Post-docs mostly). The difference between those guys and you on the one hand and a syrian refugee on the other hand is that you speak english. That allows you to get through most of your everday conversations without even bothering with german. You are not forced to use german every time you want to communicate. To be completly honest, if it was not my mother tounge, i would not bother to ever learn german. But if you are forced to use a language every time you open your mouth, you get fluent quite quickly. That can't be compared to the learning pace you have in high school. I have met syrians who i could hold a conversation with in german, and those where people 9 months in the country. I was totally awestruck i kid you not, he had better pronunciation than my cousins british husband living in germany for 30+ years. The vocabulary was a bit limited obviously, but damn.   I guess some language skills translate more easy to some languages than others. For example Japanese-German. I have been equally impressed by japanese speaking german, vladimir putin for example also has a very good grasp of german being able to fluently and correctly translate german to russian https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPOT9ZVW0hg.  No offense, but English speakers seem to struggle more with german than some other nationals. Nothing to do with intelligence though im sure. I learned Spanish well enough to read short stories and watch TV with Spanish subtitles in 3 years as a teen. And by 3 years, I mean 3h/w with minimal homework and no time given to the language at all outside of school. In full immersion ? Would have taken me 6 months to get there. I have known people who only took 6 months to get there. So Spanish might be an easier language but hell, there have been reports of the part of first wave of Afghani refugees already becoming proficient.  Little story : Once upon a time, I wanted to learn German (A Rammstein fangirl). The language wasn't taught in my school so I looked up the Goethe Institute in my town. The person responsible told me they offered two programs. The first of 5 months, leading to an expected A2 knowledge of the language and the second of 10 months that gave a B2 level of proficiency upon successful completion. B2 is the level required to apply for post-secondary studies in Germany or for German citizenship. I ended up not enrolling because classes happened at the time of my music lessons, but just to give you an idea of the timeline. 20h/w for 10 months is apparently all you need to become proficient, according to Germany's most prominent cultural promoter.  But should those trivial differences literally make or break a job offering ? Like maybe German people aren't used to loud laughter and overly friendly greetings but does it really matter in an office ? And honestly, you're exaggerating. I don't know what's with y'all Americans and not believing in adaptation to surroundings, but most people adopt the mannerisms of the majority around them unconsciously.   This is a fairly accurate timeline from wikipedia:  1961: 6.800 turkish citizen  1971: 652.000  1981: 1.546.000  1991: 1.780.000  1998: 2.110.000  There was some form of invitation offered i think, some form of green card program. Many of these turks where very low skilled workers, i'd say even most(99%). Because that was the needed and encouraged demographic.  My father worked in steel and wire plants at the time(hard labor), and he told me turkish immigrants where all over the jobs there. Even today when i visit companies like these as part of my job they have alot of Turkish workers, young and old as they often introduce family members to the companies(its considered a very good workplace, overpay, unionized etc and the companies appreciate having family ties in the company, it put pressure on youths to ""behave"" when their father or uncle is looking over their shoulder).   Ofc the Turkish are 2nd or 3rd generation by now, its ethnicity by now, not nationality when i call them turkish.  The thing is they did us loads and loads of good. We wouldn't be the country we are today without them, both figuratively and literally. When i went to school 30% of my class where of Turkish descent, they still carry a strong accent because they spoke turkish at home back then.  They are not more criminal than ethnic germans, they are more conservative on average, but still mostly vote left of merkel since the SPD(social democrats) are kind of their political party(unionized jobs, SPD being the union party).   Most criticism, most far right propaganda, come from the eastern parts of germany. The part of germany that was on the other side during the cold war, the part of germany that does not share this history i talked about above. They are afraid of what they don't know. Still means that a community that has a shared religion has issues. In Europe Muslims are by far the leaders in rape and murder. Definitely per capita, and I would bet there is a good chance they would have the most in general.  In America African Americans have the most murdere and rapes out of any other American. They fill the prisons. Not per capita. Only 13% of the population.  There is a fundamental problem in both communities. To ignore it is to be purposefully ignorant. To deny reality. People that deny reality to not hurt feelings are the most dangerous people in my opinion [removed] Non-Mobile link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war_by_the_United_States#Declarations_of_war *** ^HelperBot ^v1.1 ^/r/HelperBot_ ^I ^am ^a ^bot. ^Please ^message ^/u/swim1929 ^with ^any ^feedback ^and/or ^hate. ^Counter: ^25234 It's literally on the page you sent, under ""Military engagements authorized by Congress"" listed as ""Iraq War"". Mince words however you like, but the Iraq War was what it was declared. How do you even dress yourself in the morning? This is exactly what created Trump.  People constantly ignoring terrorist attacks, refusing to label who's behind them.  Dragging feet to solutions. No, you missed the word with out, it would have made much more sense then, thank you for correcting your silly error. Now kindly fuck off and die, somewhere quietly, but probably not America in the near future eh?    Definitely, I certainly agree with everything you say. Fuck off you donk, talk to someone that cares. In our exchanges,I have tried not to directly insult you, if only you could do the same. I am bored of this exchange now. Cya Well they aren't going to bother checking you if you are a dual national of that country and a closely allied one. I even have three passports and have done the exact thing you've said.   What I am saying is to not rule out the potential information they they might be working with. If you are American and British, they really couldn't care. But if you are born in a suspected country or related to someone from such a country, you may be flagged up etc.   It simply might not happen to you if the secondary nationality is not of importance to the inspecting country. I think you might be simplifying the workings behind passport control a little too much.  Which would be valid if the only defense against Trump's critics is an Obama deflection. He also pointed out that there was no media outrage for Obama which is easily proven false. It's not like the news media was invented on Jan 20th, 2017.   You tell me where it is? You claimed I'm not holding consistent positions. Where is my position on Obama? I think you mix up the difference between ""could hold a conversation"" and ""able to work in an office environment as an engineer""  No offence taken, as even amongst my pears I'm considered very talented with languages. My mother tongue being hungarian, my 2nd English, 3rd german and 4th Italian.   None the less, even though I'm qualified enough to help write German-born students their Master-thesis, (based mostly on the tone and actual scientific content) hold guest lectures at the university in german for Energy Design, I still make mistakes in written scientific texts here and there, **which would translate very badly in written reports**.   And that is the reason Im saying, that Refugees have an immense obstacle with Language.  A large portion of communication is via E-mail, written language with its own little set of rules.  For example if I want to ask for the floor plans of the building from the architect, because I need to evaluate them regarding the HVAC design, there are several ways I could do that:  - Hello Tom, could you please send the new plans to us, if possible?  - Hello Mr. Smith, we require the new plans for our evaluation by 11.11.11, could you please send them to us?  - Dear Mr. Smith, as discussed during the meeting last week, we require the current plans for our evaluation. Please send them to us by the 11.11.11 at the latest.  If you have any questions, please contact as under xyz  - Hello Tom, as discussed during the meeting last week, we require the current plans for our evaluation. Could you please send them to us by the 11.11.11 at the latest.  If you have any questions, please contact as under xyz  And the funny thing is, only one of the above would be considered OK in Germany in a business setting.  (If you are wondering which, its actually the third from the top)  > I learned Spanish well enough to read short stories and watch TV with Spanish subtitles in 3 years as a teen  Passively understanding a language and actively being able to write formal reports in it are not equivalent in any way. 20h/w for 10 months is an unreasonable pace for someone who is trying to work or look for work full time. I'd also wager many occupations would require higher levels of proficiency. For instance, would they teach you the words for hydraulic, aerodynamic, or manifold?  Many jobs look at how good of a ""fit"" an individual will be given their current staff. If the new guy is going to be staring at people and making them feel intimidated or avoid all eye contact and seem untrustworthy, that could be cause to pick another equally qualified candidate. Adaptation can happen, but why pick the person that needs to adapt versus the one that is already capable of working without making other's feel uncomfortable. I'm not suggesting people pass on a person due to one thing, but more of it being included in the larger decision-making process. In my experience Turks have always been the most secular of middle-easterners. That's pretty cool though, they're a pretty big cultural part of Germany. It's a relationship with a middle-eastern ethnicity that would be pretty difficult for America to have considering our politics in the middle-east and obviously what's going on in our white house.  It's ridiculous to see all Muslims in Germany as one community. There are certain communities with crime problems, but most Muslim are not part of these. Sure there is problem with crime and violence in some communities. But that doesn't have anything to do with color of skin or religion. And stating that isn't ignoring a problem.  You may see that the original comment didn't say ""look at some communities and the problems with crime there, some of them are even predominantly Muslim"". It talked about Muslims in general. And generally they are doing absolutely fine.  Another thing is that the comment tries to compare the Muslims in Europe with Muslims arriving in the US. That is not a good comparison because of the different backgrounds and circumstances of the arrival. > In Europe Muslims are by far the leaders in rape and murder. Definitely per capita, and I would bet there is a good chance they would have the most in general.  Not exactly true if you put it like that - *some* predominantly muslim communities are overrepresented... some not. For instance, Moroccans and people from other North African countries are over-represented in crime stats - Syrians are under-represented though. Non-muslim immigrants from the Balkans on the other hand also commit more crimes per capita.   So quite obviously it's not about ""the muslims"", but about specific communities and their problems.  What lies am I telling? You can look up the state of Germany yourself. They are doing incredibly well at the moment with a budget surplus.  The way I've seen it talked about on reddit, there's literally hoards of millions of refugees raping their way through Berlin. Yet I went to Berlin myself a few weeks ago and experienced no trouble at all. I'm planning my next visit fairly soon as it was an awesome place. When was the last time you was in Germany? ""The table below lists the five wars in which the United States has formally declared war""  These are:   War of 1812   Mexican - American War   Spanish - American War   WWI   WWII  And thats it. The US has not declared war since WWII. You can call that mincing words, I call that simple facts. The fact that Congress told the president ""yeah ok you can do that"" is definitely not a declaration of war.   I dress myself using both my hands, how do you do it? No, and you proved it already that Im right. Maybe not with my spelling/wording, but with my intention.

Space Zerg Rush: India https://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/india-029.jpg  Couldn't resist! =) But glad to see more countries claiming space ...in space.  I wonder how much this would help the Indians develop a  multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) fora  ballistic nuclear  missile? As I understand India is working on the Surya missile which is a intercontinental ballistic missile that will have a MIRV capacity and hit any target on the planet. Today's valuable research satellite is tomorrow's space junk. Humans are interplanetary litterbugs. It's interesting that archeologists study ancient (and modern) dumps for clues about how people live(d). Future historians will collect and dissect our space trash, as well.   Yet still no serious concerns about space debris because of the ""fuck it we'll figure something out later so shut up"" attitude we are going to have severe  space travel hazards as it becomes more common place in future. TIL India uses the spray and pray method to launch satalites. Is there a benefit to doing this or are they just trying to be cool? Can they feed all their people? No. A couple years ago when they sent that probe to Mars for less money than the film gravity  I'm an Indian. I think the reason is India is and always has been a country of fixes and hacks. It's almost instinct to us, so engineering problems are generally our thing, just look at the number of engineers we have. Simply put, just for an example, if there's a part that needs to be somehow secured, and it's going to be safe from the effects of acceleration, temperature and radiation, binding it with scotch tape will be atleast be considered, if not chosen. On reddit? Never. India is still considered to be full of people shitting on streets by most of the redditors. As an Indian I agree.   And I'm okay with you username.  they trump quite a lot of things, you know. You have to remember that starting from very little, and getting to some where is alot easier than what the bigger space programs have to deal with to make advances.  This is a great step forward the more nations that have, and are working on accessing space, reduces costs. Any nation no matter how small their contribution should be lauded at this point in time. when they can actually complete a manned mission they have decent capabilities, but don't have the proven reliability yet.  When launching a billion dollar satellite that is the culmination of a 5-10 year program, companies (and government agencies) can be a bit risk averse.  edit:  looks like the indian bandwagon is strong with this one.  go learn a bit about satellite insurance.  i guess people that underwrite such contracts know ""nothing"" about risk.  majority of reddit thinks space x is reliable also, lol. When they abolish the crippling poverty the nation has  Are they doing anything groundbreaking though? Space programs are great but when you're the 5th or 6th country to do something it gets cheaper and easier through collaboration. >He said the satellites would have a combined payload of around 1,360 kilograms (1.36 tons) micro-satellites, weight is barely nothing compared to what a heavy-lift rocket launches.  Also a lower orbit (higher orbits can need a lot more fuel).  The part thats novel is launching so many different objects. **13.08** kg Thx bot. U summed it up better than I could.... Sweet Jesus, it's true: we're all gonna be replaced by bots one day... Not sure how reliable this is, but this website claims they'll be launched at 500km, which is Low Earth Orbit. http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/How-ISRO-plans-to-launch-103-satellites-on-a-single-rocket/article17075073.ece  ""I don't care that we don't have satelites ready, launch 105 bricks"" Does NASA take contracts like that? Why does every thread have something to do with US and Trump? Stop spreading our hegemony everywhere.  Let them read in peace Not much at all. That is what their hyper sonic glide vehicle is for. The Chinese has an [prototype space garbage cleaner in space right now](https://youtu.be/JvCwbwu0Vk4) tugging space debris towards the atmosphere to burn. Every satellite they launch is already logged and tracked and reviewed by the ISRO itself, given a number, registered with ITSO (if applicable), and followed by the UN, UK, US, China, and most likely Russia, and every orbit has already been meticulously calculated and reviewed twice or thrice over, and in general has been since bloody Sputnik. What's the problem. Didn't they watch Wall-E? 90% these satellites are foreign satellites from Germany, Canada, USA and Japan. So experimenting is pretty much non-risky for India. Nanosats are becoming more economically practical.  Some pts from the article: We are not doing this launch to create any sort of record but to utilize the excess capacity available on the PSLV, said Mr. Jayakumar. He said the satellites would have a combined payload of around 1,360 kilograms (1.36 tons).""  ""ISROs launches would further entrench Indias position as a cost-effective and reliable destination for launching satellites. ""  ""ISRO has so far put 122 satellites in orbit, including 43 from India and 79 from other countries.  In June last year, it put 20 satellites into orbit in a single mission."" Multiple payloads means you only need one size of rocket.  They just size the rocket for the biggest kind of satalite and when they get smaller ones send them up in groups.  Having one rocket for everything is quite a cost saving  Really? So I guess a personal computer =/= computer, just because it was smaller than previous versions? Miniaturization is a guiding theme in tech. Ever hear of Moore's Law? Nano particles =/= particles  Nano sim card =/= sim card  Nano technology =/= technology  nanoplankton =/= plankton  So yeah. Name one country without hungry people.  Also,  poor =/= hungry.  There are temples/organisations that provide food for free. Then there are ration cards (similar to food stamps in the US) for the poor (....which no one is trying to take away from anyone.)  Not saying there aren't any hungry people in India but rather that there are things done about it. Exactly. Yet look around at some of the fuckwits in this thread. Need to pull their heads out of their arses. Not all Missions can be compared on cost. The Mars Orbiter put up by ISRO has a significant elliptic orbit they only allows for the scientific instruments to be used a portion of the time.   NASA's MRO mission has basically full time utilization. Not to mention a far more advanced payload. The money spent for information gathered vastly favors NASA, even though ISRO's mission was cheaper.  Not to bash ISRO though. I love watching their progress. >  think the reason is India is and always has been a country of fixes and hacks. It's almost instinct to us,  err...incorrect inferences getting cause and effect wrong. like wet roads cause rain.  Biggest issue is funding, out and out.  If you want NASA level triple,quadruple redundancy, you needs lots of money to design and test that shit.  See the difference between ISRO and NASA budgets. if you're forced by constraints, you do the necessary hacks or jugaad. Across the board that's what happens. Reasons for stampedes, fires, accidents....never enough money to do it right.  See the National Highways, it's world class in the road material but look at the signboards and road safety aspect of it, it's shit if not actually dangerous.  Get a US NTSB safety inspector here, and he'd fail the road builder on all counts. (braking distance, signboards, road shoulder design, road ramp to move into/out of highway, intersection design are ALL incorrect)  One major safety fail, in TamilNadu at least, the warning signboard for an approaching intersection is less than 100m away from it and there's only 1 of it. unlike 3-4 of them in the USA. since people routinely hit 80kmph on their cars,are we surprised at highway deaths at Xions?  It boils down to money; these things cost a lot and when you're the lowest bidder, you either don't do it and do a lip service to it if you can't get away with pocketing it.  And that's not unique to India. The number of engineers has to do with outsourcing.  Today we shit on street. Tomorrow we shit on world. Who says they can't do both?  Most of the world too. Snake charmers and people shitting on sidewalks. Well if you've ever been to India, I don't think you'll find a more uneven distribution of wealth. and actually achieve them. essentially putting their money where their mouth is.  You're one to talk. Why is a manned space mission that important?   Manned missions are not considered a priority for ISRO. ISRO's primary goal is to help the people on the ground with advanced space based technologies.   India's space program has given India the domestic advantage in weather monitoring, resource mapping, telecommunications, navigation services etc. These services  help ordinary indians way more than a prestige based manned mission. they don't work on your priority   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crew_Module_Atmospheric_Re-entry_Experiment  it's on the planning board. they already have astronaut suits, a pad abort test is planned and so on.  2020 ISRO's reliability is pretty damn good. PSLV, which is ISRO's launch vehicle has a success rate of 95% with only 2 out of 39 launches failed. And Antrix Corporation, ISRO's commercial arm, rakes in millions for the government by launching commercial satellites.  That shows how much outdated your information is. But hey, country of street poopers is more fun to say. And yet i bet you're a spacex fanboy who breezed over the recent take-off explosion Each year the country is taking millions, million is a yuuge number, out of poverty. looks like a jealous Pakistani's jimmies have been rustled.  sigh. You do realize, ISRO is self-funding right? It makes money from providing a launch platform and then uses those funds to grow their space program. Also, why can't a country do both? Given India's size, even if ISRO was tax payer funded it would hardly make a dent fixing poverty.    Which is why India was one of the main contributors to millenium development goals along with China Thread title > but when you're the 5th or 6th country to do something it gets cheaper and easier through collaboration.  and what collaboration did they get? you realise ISRO developed the cryo engines under a technology denial regime?  and the only ones to have done  and mastered both  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas-generator_cycle  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staged_combustion_cycle  because no one fucking helped. I don't think they want to do anything ground breaking. Their goal is to largely provide cheap launch services to outside customers and further fund their space program. In a few decades, they'll get to a point where they might do more interesting things. It's a good model and it works from them. This isn't about dick waving against other established space agencies of the world.  > 1,360 kilograms  13KG each 3 heavy duty Indian satellites and 101 tiny sattelites ""The Hindu"" is one of the biggest news papers in India. So, I'd think it is reliable. atmospheric drag at 500km will likely cause all the orbits to decay then overtime, so spacejunk effect will be minimal.  LEO slowly cleans itself out, though it gets repopulated with junk quite often. See: The Space Race It may sound crazy but seeing spacecraft that are only for peaceful purposes is great for humanity.  India's space program is completely isolated from it's missile plan. The technologies employed by ISRO and DRDO are different.  Wow, I haven't heard about that, pretty damn cool! An ""easy"" way getting rid of it too. Satellites are not reliable enough to stick to their designated orbits forever. We have malfunctions all the time and no way to repair or collect the damaged devices. One collision between similar-sized objects and your calculations aren't worth shit, you get debris flying everywhere in chaotic patterns.  Even if we had perfect control over man-made satellites and their debris, material from outer space would still cause problems. As I said, we have no way to remove all the trash and debris, we don't even have a way to detect and monitor them all properly. The material accumulates in orbit. And it hits spacecraft all the time. With speeds of several thousand meters per second.   [Here you see a surface panel of the Hubble Telescope after 15 years in orbit.](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mxXCI.jpg) Wouldn't a nano satellite be almost guaranteed to burn up in our atmosphere? Do they tend to orbit at a different height then traditional, if I may use that term, satellites? What about the tiny little undetectable scraps that are released while decoupling that many little satellites? What are India Space Agency's guarantees, that their decoupling and on-orbit maneuvering technologies won't produce any? Yeah it's called NORAD and they have had to tell the ISS to move multiple times because there's tons of debris from man made objects moving at supersonic  speeds. You don't think that in the future when multiple spacecraft carrying humans travel to and from the Earth this will somehow not be an issue? Of course the go to ""solution"" seems to be ""well we'll figure something out later"". That debris seemed to hold its position for quite some time /s Except you don't get paid if you are not able to deliver their requirements and maybe even pay for their satellites if they get damaged during flight miniaturization doesnt always mean it delivers all the capabilities.  signal strength, band width, ability to reorientate, and survive for a long time in the hostile environment of space - and many others - these nanos lack.   I won't even scroll down, but usually whenever India does something positive: ""Why don't Indians stop raping/help the poor/stop shitting in streets rather than doing xyz""  Whenever it's something negative: ""Welp, never going to India, bunch of savages""   I know the NASA stuff is more advance but for a first attempt ISRO did incredibly well. Everyone els's first attempt failed. I really want to see what they come up with 30 years in.  ISRO is big on doing things perfectly for as low a cost as possible. I remember seeing an interview in which someone from ISRO did mention that the current methods for sending full time utilization probes are very expensive and they're working on developing a cheaper more effective process.  SpaceX has a similar ideology and I believe that if humanity wants to be a multi planetary species, this is how all space agencies should start thinking. Yes, ISRO's mission was significantly simpler mission in terms of scientific payload. They had to water down the mission because the vehicle they had originally were going to use GSLV was not ready so they went with less payload carrying vehicle PSLV.   However, the elliptical orbit was by design. They have instruments calibrated to work best at different distances from the planet. When the probe is at a distance different instruments are switched on as against when it close to the planet.   Checkout /r/ISRO/ I said nothing about the reason. Financial constraints, top tiers of governance constantly skimming money off the top of the financial food chain, or corruption, whatever the reason may be, we make do with what we have, and we do it well. And because we do it well, skimming of the top has become such a part of the process that the system is functional in spite of all that. My point was we are good at fixes and hacks and jugaads, irrespective of the reasons. Jugaad (a hindi word that means a quick, dirty, working solution to a problem for those who don't know) is exactly what has kept us going, and that's not a bad thing at all.  Jokes aside, /u/achtung94 is right.  India has a long history of mathematics and history, being credited with being the nation that invented zero. :) That is true, but the number of engineers does show how many people want to be engineers. There's a reason most Indians look at engineering and medicine rather than research- engineering/medicine is a stable field, in the sense that once you get a job, you're pretty solid. All you need to do is use your brain and come up with solutions to problems, something we're very good at on average. This is as opposed to research or entrepreneurship, which requires initiative and drive, something we suck balls at. Tell us what to do and give us money, we'll do it for you.  Please do the needful. Trump's on it right now. Shit on Mars?  Hell they can even shit in space streets when they get made. Nice.  i don't care about india's space program, i'm just saying it's not cool until they can send someone into space PSLV is quite small compared to other LVs and cannot be used for commercial geosynchronous telcom satellites.  The GSLV may be able to do some of the satellites, but its track record is not good enough. the more expensive and irreplaceable ones are not being launched by the ISRO.  satellites come in a wide array of costs and the more expensive ones tend to be the end result of a several year program.   go continue your circlejerk that all launch abilities are ""equal"" and that risk assessment isn't part of expensive projects. space x ....lol.  they are crap reliability.  nah, just not afraid to say some people have room for improvement I can't understand what you're trying to say That's not true and you know it  I read that the 3 Indian satellites constitute majority of the payload, and the 101 others are nano satellites 3 heavy duty which will be launched along the main axis.  the fun part is getting 101 seperate ones launched off the main axis Not sure why you think that would sound crazy.  And I know all of that already. What do you want us to do - stop launching satellites? Out of the question. We already have plans to counter debris, we already have tracking systems and organizations, if there's a disaster, the plans will be enacted and the systems will be augmented - just like in every other industry. So, again, what's the problem? The satellites have been given the greenlight up to years ago, they launch in a few weeks, they're going to do their job. Nothing much more can be said. It would burn up to dust, yes; but the second part of your question wholly relies on the orbits of the satellites in question. My guess is that they are more 'low' orbit satellites, simply because getting to Geostationary transfer orbit is a hassle. This is not just the ISRO responsibility and they do not operate in isolation . India is part of the [Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee] (http://www.iadc-online.org/) which overseas and co-ordinates launches.  India already has   [radar and tracking resources](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/science/isros-new-multipurpose-radar-can-track-space-debris/article7210183.ece)  dedicated for space junk.  That's just, quite frankly, part of the deal; but even those things are tracked - the world tracks 12,000 pieces of debris; we've only launched 7,000 satellites, the rest are bits and pieces from rocket launches even before the first Saturn was conceived; but if I had to guess such things would be very low on the tier for detection and observation and especially moreso if the decoupling of the rocket stages and orbital insertions of the satellites are low earth orbits. Please ask NASA that too or any space agency after ISRO No, it won't be a issue because Humanity isn't going to start jumping into space to warrant that as a concern to begin with. At best, the InterPlanetary Transport System doesn't blow up like the old N1s and you have a launch every few years carrying a hundred people; which is already manageable due to our tracking systems, and maybe the Russians and Chinese have their own little five-can space stations in addition to Skylab II and if we're really lucky an inflatable space hotel. I doubt we're going to have suborbital airliners, space elevators, civilian owned spaceships or orbital spacedocks or ringed space stations either, to worry about -we're not going to have a dozen Yuri Mihairokoh's running around by 2100.  If you're looking for a solution on how to remove space debris, there's been everything from [lasers](http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cst/csat20.pdf) to more [lasers](http://www.spacefuture.com/archive/orions_laser_hunting_space_debris.shtml) to [tugs](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19920016139.pdf) to field tests of space ['nets'](https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/s/stars-2) *already*.  We've launched around 7,000 satellites in the last sixty, seventy years. We've had have five impacts. Space is still more than navigable. The problem doesn't warrant a solution to be put into place yet to begin with; and you'll find that preventive infrastructure is an unpopular political and economic hill to die on, as well. Well, ISRO have very high success ratio, though. Understood, but small -> micro -> nano is where we're headed (swarms). Nanos are being ramped up due to lower costs of delivery. What capabilities does a ""real"" satellite have the smaller ones don't?   I get that launching smaller satellites is not the biggest of deals but they won't be launching them if they weren't useful.   Small or big, the satellite serves it's purpose.  What are the capabilities of a ""real"" satellite?  A billion or so ""savages"" at that, it's a country that's moving forward regardless of the hate, I wish them well! Telling Indians to fix their problems before going to space or doing any technical progress has been going on for a while, the pooinloo thing just made it more mainstream, edgy le meme xd and acceptable to do. Someone raised an interesting point that back in the 80-90's, when China was developing fast, people from developed nations made fun of them and said similar things. Most stereotypes associated with both China and India, at least in the West, come from these.  They don't understand (or more accurately, don't want to understand) that high-minded scientific research is one of the best ways to pull people up from poverty. There is one thing that *does* ""trickle down"" to the poorer and neglected segments of a population: technological advances. These advances raise the quality of living for huge numbers of people, and QoL and financial situation are the chief predictors in illegal and unwanted behavior.   Going to space stops crime.  No doubt. I met  kiran Kumar at IAC last year and it was great. The future is bright for ISRO.  It's a lot easier to do something when someone else has already done it and you have access to reports resulting from billions of dollars of R&D than being a pioneer.   It's cool to see, but let's not blow things out of proportion. I'll be properly impressed when they're the first to do something. Then (and only then) will they be on the same level as NASA in my eyes. I'm not saying what they did isn't worthy of praise or that I would expect them to be matching NASA in technical complexity on their first mission.   I'm just making the point that price comparisons are a poor measure of achievement.   It is like comparing a Boeing 787 and a Cessna citation and saying they both fly so they are equivalent.  Technically, they didn't do it perfectly.  One of their primary scientific instruments is incapable of doing it's mission due to a design flaw.  http://www.space.com/34943-india-mars-orbiter-mission-methane-detector-flaw-red-planet.html >  and always has been a country of fixes and hacks  well, that certainly is not true.  Where there is sufficient money, it is done right and done well. The recent PDS, central drug supplies purchase system are all gov reforms of existing platforms fixed correctly now, with the funds available. it's even saved money by weeding out duplicates and drugs supplies issues And people want that zero all the time! Zero bugs mostly, but other zeroes too. The society that invented zero has nothing to do with modern india or any modern country.  But if you must, the modern countries doing the best with that knowledge should be seen as the ancestors of that older scientific culture.  Religions basically separated the middle east and south asia from that previous society.  Europe if anything is more connected to it. That was ancient India, you can't compare it with modern india > This is as opposed to research or entrepreneurship, which requires initiative and drive, something we suck balls at.  This is not entirely true though. I feel that the main reason people don't go for research is the lack of funding, not interest. Plus the number of seats are just too low compared to engineering >something we're very good at on average.  I think the number one thing anyone who works with asians will say is that they completely lack creativity.  If the task is well defined they do the job at robotic speeds.  If the task requires invention, they can't do it.  The only reason the west has nothing to fear from india and china is that they cannot invent or think creatively. (the people in those countries that can do this lived in the west for years to start linking creatively)  The day our exportation of western culture to these regions elevates them to our level of creativity is the day america and europe stop having any advantage. And revert back :P Am Indian. Can confirm that this will happen! > i don't care about india's space program,  right  >i'm just saying it's not cool until they can send someone into space  you have a viewpoint when you don't care? nice.  BTW, ISRO doesn't do things for the cool factor AND especially for you.  They care a rat's arse for your opinion.  i thought telecom satellite was a mid-grade altitude launch. No one said all abilities are equal.  But making blank statements like what you do is laughable. But go ahead, internet is free. I think you *are* afraid to say some people *have* improved. I don't know why though... http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2013/07/29/indias_silent_poverty_reduction_miracle_119407.html  > India has just reduced its number of poor from 407 million to 269 million, a fall of 138 million in seven years between 2004-05 and 2011-12.  It's basically three satellites and a hundred and one low orbit footballs. The PSLV has been used 30 times and has been successfully launched for 29 consecutive times.  A fair number I believe are simply ""lets launch this highschool science experiment into orbit for a small sum. And the successes of India aren't due to, but inspite of opposition from the developed world.   ISRO had to literally build their own technology for cryogenics since the US didn't sell and didn't allow USSR to sell it to India either. This ended up delaying the space program, but they did succeed eventually.   Sometimes I wonder if globalization is really worth it or is just another stick to beat poor countries with.  Who's kiran kumar? > It's a lot easier to do something when someone else has already done it and you have access to reports resulting from billions of dollars of R&D than being a pioneer. >   China (in 2011) and Japan (in 1998) couldn't. Both missions failed. India didn't have access to western technologies as US denied giving it to them and stopped USSR from doing the same. It's completely indigenous.  That's why India took so long to develop their cryogenic engine and with GSLV Mk-III, they've finally succeded. This means they can start manned missions now Nobody's comparing them to NASA, as they shouldn't.   Also ISRO isn't trying to be the first to do something, their agenda is to do whatever others do for much cheaper for proof so that they can capture the multi billion dollar launch market.       >  I'll be properly impressed when they're the first to do something. Then (and only then) will they be on the same level as NASA in my eyes.  then you'll never be a scientist of any kind worth knowing.  Knowing someone else did it before is just one aspect. if what is you say is true, then all 110+ countries would have had a space programme and a successful one at that. Or nukes of various sorts  More specifically, did NASA teach ISRO to do a 'dog leg' maneuver when launching rockets to avoid SriLanka? any paper specific to the Indian context from NASA?  Or remote sensing? Some of it is classified, so Indians did it ab initio and now have a large constellation doing both civilian and military needs  Lots of countries have learnt and leapfrogged what they've learnt from another country. By hook or by crook, including the USA.  I should've mentioned that my comment wasn't a rebuttal. I was just adding on to your comment with my opinion. well, that's not ack'ed by ISRO yet. We have only one team's word on it.  Let's wait and see  >  the modern countries doing the best with that knowledge should be seen as the ancestors of that older scientific culture.  I have to disagree. :P Yeah I suppose they just stopped being inventive for thousands of years, waiting for those sweet sweet outsourced jobs.  Perhaps modern India is standing on the shoulders of giants?  Seems facile to just dismiss their ancient history and claim that their modern one is somehow different.  Their modern accomplishments come out of the contexts of their ancient, recent and modern histories just like it would for any other nation. > I feel that the main reason people don't go for research is the lack of funding, not interest. Plus the number of seats are just too low compared to engineering  This. is. the. only. reason  I was in a unique position to watch a large batch of students who were forced to leave the country because there are no R&D positions for the kind of work they did or too few of them  My school classmate worked on battery technology in the 2000s; years drifting doing crap jobs till the market picked up for electric vehicles in India.  if he had gone to the USA, he'd have good position for decades because there's lots of R&D in that specific area That definitely is part of the reason, but a look at the number of research students abroad as opposed to those going for a masters and then going on for jobs will kinda prove my point. It is true lack of funding is a problem, but if you're an indian, or know one, you'll know that only a miniscule percentage is remotely interested in anything other than just working for money and setting down. That may be true too, but I personally would disagree. I really think we just don't use our brains any more than we need to. Its not that we lack creativity, we just don't use it much, too much trouble I suppose.  Thank you, come again.  Le le beta, Shoo shoo Sky train track per he ker lay. how else will our rockets move forward!! again, i don't care about what this isro does, i'm replying to a comment that's suggesting india's space program is ""cool"", it's not > mid-grade altitude launch  What does this mean? Most telecom satellite are in GEO so satellite dishes don't have to move and they never go out of coverage. >lets launch this highschool science experiment into orbit for a small sum  NASA to poor highschooler : Give fuck ton of money or fuck off with your itty-bitty-titty experiments.   ISRO to poor highschooler:  We have got your back.  Somebody got to work on that niche.   I never said it's *easy*, just *easier*. It's great that they pulled it off, but let's keep our accolades in proportion with the achievement. Actually, I've seen a few people do the comparing.  Which is annoying, because they use it as an example to justify cutting space funding. You can't really disagree with that.  The culture that invented science in that region was completely expelled and survived in the west.  It has no direct connection to those that currently occupy the region. Wars cause all kinds of damage to systems especially education. That's one of the things I hate India for. We've been singing about that stupid zero and ancient achievements for far too long. Every time someone I know starts about our glorious history I ask them to stfu, because it doesn't matter. I personally think that while Indians may naturally be inventive, we are also naturally complacent. Most Indians don't do anything beyond what needs to be done- again in the spirit of being hacks and fans of quick dirty easy solutions- as long as it works, we won't make any effort to improve. It's the reason why progress seems to take so fucking long in the country. Lots of potential, no kinetic energy, is the best I can put it. Indians perform quite well under the right conditions, look at the Indians abroad, especially in large engineering firms. We look for comfort and adequacy, not superiority. I wish it changed, but meh. Oh yeah I'm not disagreeing, just thought that that statement was incomplete without the funding part.   Hell, I'm doing engineering myself even though I preferred phyics This is what is wrong with the world today.  You don't get to disagree with facts.  >Its not that we lack creativity, we just don't use it much, too much trouble I suppose.  Same thing. Your culture is against creativity.  If you don't practice creativity, you won't have it.  It is not something you get automatically. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeXT0gNeSvM >  i'm replying to a comment that's suggesting india's space program is ""cool"", it's not  cool, you want fries with that? most telecom satellites are part of a constellation and at a much lower altitude then geosynchronous orbit for better signal strength  yes, there are some though that do use geosynchronous orbit but its a good bit more expensive to get the same signal strength and altitude for those launches. more so:  98.5% chance it launches, costs 4x more.  70% chance it launches, quarter the price.  microsatellites are usually far easier to replace, so chance of failure isn't nearly as important of a factor as cost. I can indeed, modern countries could never be the ancestors of any older country. and a campaign run to kill the creativity and manufacture clerks for the empire You talk like an authority on my culture, where are you from? America? >[**A Walk In The Woods : Animated Short : MrWeebl [2:07]**](http://youtu.be/MeXT0gNeSvM)  >>A rabbit takes a walk in the woods and gets into a chase with a bear.  > [*^Weebl's ^Stuff*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9wk6mlzKKN3_sVMPd2p-3Q) ^in ^Comedy  >*^231,894 ^views ^since ^Jun ^2013*  [^bot ^info](/r/youtubefactsbot/wiki/index) There are few satellites constellations in the first place. Iridium being one of them.  However, in terms of companies and revenue. Most sit out in GEO. Signal strength isn't really an issue because of directional antennas. Wrong.  The Indian pslv has a far higher success rate.  Probably somewhere in the high 90s Hmm, the launch vehicle being used has like a 97% success rate...so, no The culture that created that science became part of the west.  None of it exists in india.  That scientific friendly culture was completely cast out of the region. I am an authority because I work with lots of indians and this is what I have learned.  Anyone working with them would learn the same thing.  Hell, you have already admitted I was right in your other posts, so don't back track now. You're not an authority because you know a handful of indians, and you think you know every Indian in the world. And I'm going to consider your crazy cocktail of ignorance and arrogance as confirmation of you being an american.

"38",37,"5qz99t","2017-01-30","""30 people including 10 women and children.""  Why don't they just give real numbers? ""20 men, 6 women and 4 children were killed "" for example. Why use this wonky counting? What's new? Just continuing the legacy.    If want to be mad at trump about this, then more power to you.   >  According to the UN, more than 10,000 people have died - nearly half of them civilians - since a Saudi-led coalition launched air strikes on Yemen in March 2015.   The very last paragraph of this article could just as easily been the title of the article. It fucking sucks and is heartbreaking that kids and innocents are dying by the thousands. So did Trump just kill 10 innocents and Obama killed 5000 innocents?! Or do we pass some blame to the Saudis or how about the terrorists who use innocents a human shields?     I really hope all this Trump hate makes places like Yemen become a fixture in the media. I don't care to debate the politics anymore. But, under Nobel Peace Prize winning Obama (lol) this whole conflict was barely reported on (sure if you dig around online...but to the masses in USA it's barely ever even mentioned.)  More exposure to whats actually going on over there. That's one positive I could see happening here. > The eight-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, a US-born Yemeni preacher who was killed in a 2011 drone attack, was also among the victims, family members said.  [Her brother Abdulrahman was also killed by a drone attack.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdulrahman_al-Awlaki) Obama is the only Nobel Prize winner ever to bomb another Nobel Prize winner, but where was the backlash for that? Also this raid was ordered from Obama and approved by Trump, so I understand the Trump hate, but don't blame him for something that he didn't create that was already in the works. ""Why kill children?"" said the relative of Anwar an-Alaki, with no detectable sense of irony. Ordered by Obama, approved by Trump. Don't get me wrong, I hate Trump to hell, but this is what NPR was reporting. I heard this same story last night, except that story said raid was planned before the inauguration i.e. not *ordered* by Trump unless you can order military strikes before you are confirmed as president. Can this happen? This is to appease the Saudis  This might be the shittiest click bait that will get thousands of mysterious upvotes here on r/worldnews here we go. the liberal media is now going to condemn drone strikes. just cause Trump is doing it. Obama did drone strikes for 8 years and nobody cared. he even killed civilians. tons of them. but suddenly it's important to talk about cause Trump is doing it. liberals are hypocrites. Trump said he could shoot someone and still win the election. well Obama was the same way. He could do anything and his followers allowed it. But then when Trump does that same thing they let Obama do, suddenly it's evil Actually, the raid was planned by Obama's administration. I don't support Trump, but I don't support misleading headlines either. Don't be uninformed people... Sorry but thats just a sick as clickbait title i dont support Trump . But its not like Trump goes and says kill this mofukas . This war could easily escalate toward direct bombing of Iran. ""Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"" for some. Laser guided drone bombs for everyone else. Strange, didn't Hillary get shit for Benghazi? Surely r/The_Donald will be critical for getting American soldiers killed right?   Remember when Trump supporters complained about obama killing people? Wait, suddenly we care about Yemen? That is a bit rich given that at least 10,000 people have died in this conflict during the Obama administration. US and UK support in the form of weapons, logistics and intelligence has been critical for the Saudi's bloodthirsty war of aggression. ""aljazeera.com""      Very objective source on the subject of Donald Trump, I'm sure. Well if a Trump presidency is going to exponentially increase people's attention towards casualties in US' middle eastern bombings, I can only count that as a positive. It's only ok if Obama does it. New addition to Al-Jazeera's propaganda now signed with more salt in the end. [SALT BAE!]  ""in first raid ORDERED BY TRUMP""  Sneak Attacks But Clinton was bad because war and drones  Planning this strike almost definitely began before Trump was inaugurated.  Even if the O.K. to execute came from the Whitehouse it is almost never starts there, it would most likely have been researched and planned by a team and sent up-hill for authorization.   Remember how Trump said on the campaign trail that we need to start killing the family members of terrorists? Could be coincidence, but... Arab here,  people in the middle east are so angry about this   America and Russia please leave the middle east alone and let us do our things alone  This article is BS. So many women and children died during the Obama adimistration  A bunch of Al Qaeda leaders were killed, too. Go Trump!  RIP innocent people. War is cruel. Al Jazeera is a [state funded news agency from Qatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera) and would post erroneous or exaggerated information to push an agenda.   Obomber was doing it daily jeez What about the thousands and thousands who were killed by drone strikes during Obama's golden rule? Can't explain the children, but I just saw a report that said women were actively taking part in the fighting. Bombing innocents a favoured pastime of the US military. This is nothing special. They do it all the time. Obama was a terrorist, and it looks like Trump is following him in his footsteps.   I wonder what excuse will be used this time. Were the supposed terrorists hiding among these woman or the American serviceman? Or are they written off as ""acceptable losses"". I've also seen the argument made that, since victims were adult males, they were automatically considered ""combatants"", but that's not very applicable in this case. The only combatant is here is part of the US military.  *Thanks Obama!*  Oh wait.   Are we still doing that?   The Right will find a way to still blame the last guy.  Fuck this guy got a long way to go until he matches Obama's drone strike casualties. lol thus begins the demonizing of a Republican for continuing a military action began by a Democrat who was never criticized for beginning it. So another day in the office if Obama still in office?  Because no one seems to care when men die. Is that some kind of surprise?  Because when pushing a narrative, you word things certain ways to give it a positive or negative connotation or to make something sound worse or better than it actually is.   Pretty much media 101 stuff.  Not sure why the down vote, this is legitimately what happens in media. They take a fact and word it in ways to make an action look better or worse. Just look at any study or statistic that's shown. They use words like double and triple or percents to twist perceptions. They're not lying when they use them, but often times, the actual numbers changing are laughably small.    One of the children was Anwar Al-Awlaki's [8-year old daughter](http://i.imgur.com/nCnuDoG.jpg). Shot in the neck and bled out, supposedly took two hours.  [More details here.](https://theintercept.com/2017/01/30/obama-killed-a-16-year-old-american-in-yemen-trump-just-killed-his-8-year-old-sister/) Overall pretty horrible.   Should we also mention that it was 14 al queda members?  statistics are written to push an agenda.   i always remember this example: 2 cars were racing, they were a Russian race car and an American race car. At the end of the race, after both cars crossed the finish line the newspapers reported the outcome.  Russian papers: the Russian car came in 2nd place and the American car came next to last.   American papers: American car came in 1st place and the Russian car came in dead last.  Each paper wrote the story they wanted you to see. Because AJ  is a shit source when it comes to middle eastern news. All men are combatants. That's at least how I understood it. According to the American terror bombing doctrine against Muslims, all massacred men are automatically counted as ""enemy combattants"", except when they posthumously prove their innocence. Which naturally doesn't happen too often. So in their official statistics they will claim that 20 of their victims were ""terrorists"". And their propaganda media takes and publishes these numbers without a question. Maybe Trump will find a way to label massacred women and children in such a way too, we will see. Also a good question is what are the ages of the ""children"" there's a big difference between an 8yo child and a 17yo ""child"" that was actually a fighter. Just like you shouldn't completely trust government casualty reports, NGO/Media reports can be just as biased in the opposite way.  Because they wanted a sensationalist and misleading headline.  Saying that they killed 20 millitants as well as 6 women and 4 children who were being used as human sheilds doesn't help them sell as many ads. Thats like asking why articles like this werent headline news under Obama. As much as it heartens me to see people paying attention to Yemeni casualties -- it's disturbing that when Obama was Commander in Chief, no one seemed to bat an eye at the daily slaughter of Yemeni civilians with US-made weapons, cluster bombs and the like.  unfortunately because that's all they become, they just become numbers.  It's also hard to find any article about Yemen before this that actually separate the women and children from the men. Americans like to pretend every adult man killed was a terrorist. Harder to pretend women and children are too. This is what you get with Reddit. Partially correct information. The US gov't legitimately counts ""male dead aged 18+"" as enemy combatants regardless of actual combat status. Cause the world must know of USA's evil transgressions! /S The thing that bothers me is the Military said 14 members of al-Qaeda were killed and that civilians might have been killed. How do they have such accurate numbers for the al-Qaeda members but they don't know IF they may have killed civilians? Doesn't make sense. Cuz it's arab reporting for u. An even simpler 20 terrorists, 10 civilians, in the eyes of many. Plenty more will question any report of civilian casualties (doctors and aid workers lying to protect terrorists, of course). Because clicks! Obviously it is hard to discern the true facts of what happened because there are no official reports, but this article claims that some women were fighting as well.  http://www.military.com/daily-news/2017/01/30/navy-seal-team-6-members-fought-female-fighters-yemen-raid.html Why's everyone assuming that this has something to do with misandry? Yup:  ""The eight-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, a US-born Yemeni preacher who was killed in a 2011 drone attack, was also among the victims, family members said.""  ""Her grandfather Nasser al-Awlaki, a former minister of agriculture said: ""she was hit with a bullet in her neck and suffered for two hours"".""  I wonder if she was an American citizen too, like Awlaki's 16-year-old son that Obama had killed.   Here's a little background on Awlaki: http://www.globalresearch.ca/dead-men-tell-no-tales-the-cia-9-11-and-the-awlaki-assassination/27001  Edit: Yes, the dead 8-year-old was an American.  Username checks out. Except Obama was smart enough to kill the women and children from unmanned drones instead of risking troops and having to scuttle an osprey.  You're right, we should ban the Saudis from immigrating here.  The situation in Yemen is horrible. With the Saudi's being able to do airstrikes supported by Britain and America. This isn't a situation of Obama vs Trump. They are both doing the same thing.  Maybe not everything has to be Trump or Obama's fault directly. This is just a horrible thing that America has been doing and will contineu to do. We're also responsible for the Saudi campaign, who do you think tells them where to drop the bombs?  With those Stats, Trump's on a pretty good roll for reducing the innocent casualty rate Don't try to put it in perspective, no one cares about the facts. Just embrace the return of the anti-war left. We can only take responsibility for our own actions, not this of others. Your own quote distorts things heavily. A Saudi Led coalition doesn't mean Obama is engaging specific air strikes to kill 5000 civilians. I've heard of 111 confirmed civilian deaths by drones, if you want to argue a lot more were made we're going to need to see the actual reputable sources and documentation for me to believe it. Finger pointing is fun. But it does little to inform the US public that we are simultaneously killing bad guys and breeding new ones by killing children. That's just from 2015. The U.S has also been bombing Yemen since 2002.  That would be the Saudi Arabia that avoided the immigration ban because of Trump's business ties? I don't mind if liberals decide to use their hatred of Trump to protest things that actually matter. It's just a shame that they were so blinded by Obama's dick in their mouth that they couldn't bring themselves to care about dead civilians when he was in office. :/ Yeah I hope this is enough to stop all this bullshit. Americans don't want this shit. It's been a long 14 years. This is a way bigger deal then turning down a few green card holders. Control of Yemen is crucial to the global oil trade as access to the dead Sea is a key geopolitical objective. If the bombing campaign ended in Yemen then an Iranian-backed puppet will control that access point.  They just created a bunch more terrorists in one fell swoop. More so than normal though because they waxed awlaki's adolescent daughter, that kind of thing reaches way past just the family or tribe.  A US born Yemeni preacher is one way of putting it.    They failed to mention the fact that he was the most dangerous man in the world after UBL Well if you want to kill the minimum number of al-Awlakis you have to kill all of them in one generation. If you just keep taking 1 out per generation, the others have offspring that you then have to take out. when you run on the platform that you're going to change the way the previous administration destroyed the country and then go ahead and continue the operations of that administration don't expect roses and doves No, no. Obama was a hero. Trump is hitler. Get on board! Also a funny thought that the people we bombed and helped bomb want to come here. If someone attacked me I wouldn't want to live with them.  terrorists justify the murder of children because if the child is not muslim, they view it as an infidel child and it's ok to kill it regardless of it's age. infidels are basically not human. if the child is muslim, it's still ok to kill it because it will just go up to heaven. that's how they are ok with mass murder. they assume any innocent people killed just go to heaven so it doesn't matter and they are really helping them along to meet Allah. Medieval people hunting witches used to do the same thing  No, unless this was something thrown together at the last minute (doubtful), all he did was greenlight the mission To be fair most of the comments are highlighting and detailing the problems with this title. Lets just hope the majority of redditors read the comment sections...  I don't condone Obama's actions in the middle east, but people would probably cut Trump some slack if he hadn't said multiple times that he's in favour of murdering the families of terrorists/suspected terrorists. You can (and should) criticise Obama, but there will always be a worry that Trump includes some civilians as targets in a way that Obama never did. This was a JSOC raid not a drone strike, boots on the ground is quite different It was wrong for the mainstream media to ignore Obama doing these things with drone strikes, but does that mean it should also be ignored under the Trump administration? Killing civilians is wrong and only further radicalizes the Middle East. You're right that the media frenzy against Trump is just now bringing this to light, but I'd argue that that's a good thing. It needs to stop, regardless of who's president. > the liberal media is now going to condemn drone strikes. just cause Trump is doing it.  Media on the left has condemned drone strikes for over a decade.  Yeah, but that's just like saying: Trump supporters condemn Obama's Middle East policies, and now they'll condone Trump's civilian drone victims.   Basically, both of them, Obama and Trump, are peaces of shit for doing this.  I love people like you. You can't defend trump so you have to blame Obama, Clinton, foreigners, or the main stream media. Anything to deflect.  You're literally telling people to shut up now, because in your opinion, not enough people spoke up against it during Obama's term. And no where in your rambling, incoherent response did you say that drones were not okay. Just that you're upset were going to have to hear about them.     Edit: ignore this comment. I just realized what subreddit this is and that it's also run by openly white nationalists. So debate is a moot point here. thats the difference between being a nobel winner and not. Obama did it in the name of peace and Trump does it in the name of violence.   /s Didn't he basically say he supports killing the relatives and families of suspected terrorists on a live TV show? Except in his campaign speeches and inaugural address.  Yea, it's not like he's commander in chief who had ultimate final authority over this or something.  Trump's just some random dipshit who overdosed on fake tan. But Obama did? Im just trying to understand the rationale behind ""Obama orders military assault against X"" even though he probably never knew about it but its his fault. Now that trump is in office and a military operation that happened under him is not his fault? Every single recent president has done nothing to stop the slaughter of innocents that is done ON ALL OF OUR DIMES. WE do nothing too. We sit and whine and say we'll vote, but we do NOTHING to stop our tax dollars fueling the insatiable war machine grinding men, women and children to dust. > Laser guided  Implies accuracy. We're liberating them from life in our pursuit of happiness. The hypocrisy from both sides is astounding. Liberals suddenly seem to care when they didn't for 8 fucking years Obama was slaughtering civilians with drones and conservatives suddenly don't.   How are they even remotely comparable?  Did anyone really care how many people Obama had killed in Yemen? The Donald and being critical? What are you on?  I'm pretty sure the two aren't comparable at all, though I admire your spirit. ?????????????????  > A guy dies in an attack on an Al-Qaeda outpost  > This is the same as noncombatants dying in an invasion, after information of risk was ignored, and then the government lied about the cause.  Are you ... Are you mentally lacking? I ask whoever upvoted this too.   Then you have the sheer gall to call other people uncritical. Holy shit. Benghazi was a embassy, death is always a possibility in a combat situation. Remember how every person in the world complains about their politicians? frankly, i weep for any folks who suddenly thought this was going to stop after obama left Because anti-war Trump supporter is a common meme. Don't get me wrong, there were plenty of people who had a problem with Obama waging war, but how many really vocally support Trump?  GIVE HIM SOME TIME!  /s  It sure what you are talking about...  One of the things Trump ran on was ending ISIS and other terrorist groups. No one should be shocked he greenlit this operation.   Trump supports against this kind of stuff would be referring to intervening in a civil war like Syria.  Al Jazeera is a internationally respected news source, seen as fairly impartial in a more biased Middle East. Anyways, it is how the world sees us, even if you think Fox News in the gold standard, no one watches that outside of Red America.  Literally the biggest news station in the ME, what are you on about? People criticized Obama for his drone strikes for the entirety of his presidency. It was never ""okay if Obama does it."" > no one said anything...   Are you sure?   They can't both be bad? Yes. Clinton is an insane warmonger who has made a career bathing in the blood of innocents. She totally would be way better in terms of Saudi Arabia and Yemen! /s She also killed a guy called Ben Ghazi, don't forget that! http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-terrorists_us_56e0d7cde4b065e2e3d4d82d   > Donald Trump said Wednesday night that he doesnt necessarily want to kill the families of terrorists  a controversial proposal he has raised at various points during his campaign.  >Instead, Trump told CNN, his policy would merely be to go after them if he wins the White House. Are they also furious with Saudi Arabia? They have been bombing the absolute shit out of yemen for like a year now- thousands of innocent chidren are dead.  Probably not since they are targeting Shias  Considering that these are both civil wars being meddled in by regional powers to begin with, I'm not really sure the solidarity your post implies actually exists. Maybe they joined al qaeda because their sons and daughters were murdered by Americans? How many more did we just create? No proof of that. Just an American attack where they claim not everyone was innocent. It's how they get away with their atrocities.  ""So what if we killed 50 innocents!? We killed 1 terrorist!""  ""You mean he was planning on committing a terrorist attack on domestic soil?""  ""No, he's trying to defend his country against invaders, so terrorist."" Al Jazeera have a fairly solid reputation, there have only been allegations of misconduct relating to their ties with the Qatar ruling class. I consider them much closer to the BBC than to RT. That's not a big deal because Obama has Yeezy on his iPod and Michelle is just sooo fashionable... Thats old news The raid was planned under Obama's administration. Trump just gave it the ok. Title is click bait. It hasn't even been a month so yea some of these things were actually a direct result of the prior admin. Are you some kind of idiot?  Why would obama even align with Saudi Arabia  in another middle eastern conflict?  Really sick of this shit. We are the god damn terrorists.  Yeah Obama's offensives never killed civilians ever. You did fuck all in Yemen before Trump. A few seaside missile drops, that's it. All the men are basically counted as enemy combatants. By the government, and by a lot of the populace as well. It mentions the US serviceman, so no one cares when foreign men die. Foreign men above the age of 18 are automatically counted as 'enemy combatants' in the US's collateral damage accounting practices. It's not that no one cares when men die, it's the assumption that women and children were innocent bystanders whereas the men could have been involved.  Because any man that dies is obviously a terrorist./s No it's because every man from the Middle East is a terrorist so it doesn't matter that they died anyway! Duhhh Or they're still counting the pieces. Also it's because if they reported the news instead of making the news then half of them would be out of a job.  They're literally being paid to bullshit their way through an article to justify their own existence. Your own answer also answers why you are getting downvotes. People are downvoting you to push a narrative. These days when anyone criticizes the media, it usually means you're pro Trump which automatically gets you a downvote, regardless of actual fact. Unfortunately this has been the theme since before the election and it's the reason things don't get discussed anymore, people just mute anyone saying something they don't like or that challenges their views. Shit first a US citizen gets droned under Obama (Anwar) and then his 8 year old daughter dies under Trump years later...  I could be mistaken here but wouldn't that make her an American citizen as well? Being that she was born to an American father, doesnt that give her US citizenship? Same with her brother.  2 hours to bleed to death? They weren't able to get her medical assistance? Doesn't make sense. So 16 murders and 14 justice killings. Can't imagine how anyone would justify this. They weren't Al Qaeda members, they are members of the Al Dhahab family who are members of a different faction of the Yemeni rebellion. It's state-funded/owned by Qatar, so it's not exactly objective. Obama considered all males aged 15 and up to be terrorists and were shot on sight by drones.  the rule with drones is that your not a child once you hit 15. Obama counted 15 year olds as men This just makes me sad. Just remember, Obama was given a Nobel Peace Prize.  Indeed.  The U.S. should stop the war on terror and just have them all kill each other off.  ""Aargh, the U.S. has killed my loved one using a drone strike so I am going to blow myself up at the market of those of a rival religion or sect to get back at them!""  No there wasn't... the CIA drone strikes have been unpopular for a while. This is gonna get extra attention since trumps supporters constantly claimed obama was a war mongorer killings children.  Where have you been the last 8 years? I was reading about it constantly on here. You're special  Impossible. They have a Trump hotel/building of some kind in their country. Only countries without Trump buildings are banned.  Edit: obviously this was somewhat tongue in cheek.   In reality I don't think Trump can plan well enough to know if they did or didn't have Trump installations...  We should ban them from life. There's not many people I agree with mass-executing, but I'm all for it.  But then how would US politicians and businessmen and military elites make their money??!   But oil money bro. They don't immigrate here. Unless you feel the three that did qualifies banning the whole country.  We could stop selling them weapons, that would be a start.  What is going on in Yemen is also a war primarily over access to water. Access that has been threatened by global warming.  Strap in, because things are going to get rough over the next decade or so.  > The situation in Yemen is horrible  Beyond horrible.  And all we ever hear about is Russia's involvement in Syria.  Sorry folks, but the good old west is doing far more heinous shit than Russia in the Middle East. The left turned anti war on Jan 20th what a coincidence too I love how you say ""anti-war"" like it's a bad thing. Are you getting bored with your Xbox and hoping to play Call of Duty in real life? They're not anti-war, they're anti-Trump.  They have no principles other than that.  War was good as long as a President with a D after his name did it. And it would have remained good if someone without a D in her pants became President. Yeah, I mean. I fucking hate how when Trump does crazy shit and you say so +5400. When he makes a decision where you are like,""well, the sky isn't falling, I own a small business, this might be good economically"" -10000 for not being so left you are a communist.  Can't we sort of look at these issues from a non-partisan perspective? Sort of stick to the facts? On BOTH sides > Yeah I hope this is enough to stop all this bullshit.  The US government is not going to stop military operations in the Middle East. Lots of people protested the war in Iraq, look how much they accomplished. Well, (this is always where the downvotes come) some people like myself do believe that the ""point"" of USA foreign policy should NOT be to play nation builders/world police...and make a mess so that we can ""let them all come here."" I DO think there is a natural evolution that these countries need to go through. We just want to meddle so that we can remain in control. The USA is the last real superpower left and they want to stay that way. Why nobody gets this is beyond me.  If a U.S. drone strike kills your relatives, friends, etc. why isn't it obvious to people that you are going to be beyond hateful against them afterwards. Welcome to American drone strikes. It baffles me how clumsy the US has been with the technology. Well just bomb everyone related or connected to them. What could go wrong? Doctors without Borders Is it really? Innocents were still killed by a US force. You could even say that drones are even less humane. There were no drone victims. The civilians here probably ran interference. This was a targeted operation. there is nothing incoherent about what he said. the morality of drone strikes is not the topic of his post. It's about the way the majority of media outlets cover it.   A couple of months ago, nobody would have said anything had obama killed innocents in a drone strike. It goes against the narrative of who he is. But now that trump is in office, its a different story.  LOL you actually think /r/worldnews isn't incredibly liberal? Nice meme dude. and on a morning news show The bombs hit exactly where you aim them. You know, in a sense Obama was more dangerous than Trump could ever be. Obama was too damn charismatic. People didn't really care about his warcrimes. >Liberals suddenly seem to care when they didn't for 8 fucking years   Where the fuck have you been? Stop casting wide nets on non-existent people. Plenty of us have been here and have been angry. A kid got shot in the neck. Drones don't do that. There are literally dozens of us. *Raises hand*  Often when I go to /r/all and see their posts I can't stop but thinking ""Surely they are not serious?"".  Not the North Koreans. Who thought it was going to stop when Trump took over?  Hell, who thought it would do anything other than increase when Trump took over? They talked about drone strikes killing people It is also literally owned and operated by the Qatari government & royal family.   They push their agenda all the time.  > Al Jazeera is a pretty respected news source.  I'm sorry but what? Isn't it owned by the Qataris? Please do some research and don't get brainwashed by the bullshit on Reddit. >Al Jazeera is a pretty respected news source.   Lmao wow > Al Jazeera is a pretty respected news source   That's it folks, I'm out. > Al Jazeera  > Respected  Yep, the left will support Qatari state sponsored news if it shits on Trump. Respected, if you don't mind getting your news directly from the Qatari ruling class. It's no different than RT. > Al Jazeera is a pretty respected news source.  HAHAHAHAHA   Al Jazeera is propaganda for the Sunni states. Nothing more nothing less. Let's be honest though, Obama did not receive the same level of criticism, likely because of his ""nice guy"" image. People might have, but you didn't see it on the news Yet he did it anyway. Hardly a peep out of the media or the left. This was a boots on the ground op, not a drone strike. None of the main stream media said anything I think the point is you can't point to what Clinton would do as a reason to not vote for her if Trump would do literally the exact same thing.  Some say she drinks from a chalice made from the skull of Ambassador Steven's unborn grandchild, Abraham Delano Reagan. Yemen is just a regular war being waged by the Saudis, the houthis won the civil war before they showed up.  It would be like Syrian rebels taking Damascus, assad fleeing to Russia, and then Russian military intervening. We would go bananas if they tried in syria what we're trying pull in yemen.   Considering everyone at r/TD told me trump was the isolationist peace candidate, it is not clickbait. The guy who authorizes it is responsible.   He's the president, he authorizes it or doesn't making it squarely his *responsibility*, and that's a word Americans should get used to hearing.   Nice deflection yo And you think that justifies this? Whether or not they're combatants.   In addition the claims are 3 high level Al Qaeda leaders were killed but in reality it was 3 leaders of a local family ""allied"" with Al Qaeda.  This family is part of the Yemeni revolution which was kicked off during the Arab spring and is essentially fighting against US/Saudi friendly government (aka a government that will ensure that foreign corporate interests are catered to at the expense of local peoples' basic welfare). This is not an attack against Al Qaeda or terrorism, its an attack against a widespread revolt with a few different parties (including shia rebels, secessionists, socialists, and others) that has been trying to throw off what is basically a foreign puppet government, just like the rest of the drone strikes and attacks against Yemen. Al Qaeda in Yemen is just an excuse to violently attack threats to a regime that wants to play ball with colonialism. Theyre called insurgents. Cause people are like fuck an insurgent! Just dehuminizing them Imagine the US media reaction if one of those civilians was able to kill a US serviceman in selfdefense. Well TBH   Guy I don't know dies: ""oh, that sucks.""  Kid I don't know dies: ""well that's way worse, they were a child."" Actually from the wording of the title it might make you assume that US servicemen were partly the target of the raid and that's why they died. Well the US serviceman was obviously an accidental death, while the main target is always going to be the men/combatants from that area Are you implying we should care? Women and children are always priority since they are required for procreation. Men don't matter as much since one man can fertilize any number of eggs.   Speaking strictly from an evolutionary standpoint. It's the same reason why women and children were allowed off the titanic first before men were allowed to disembark. Women can bear another generation. Men cannot.  if people cared then Obama wouldnt be so popular these days. That's not better at all. What, can women not hold guns and blow people up anymore? Does having a penis automatically make your life forfeit just for existing? You really think this is sensationalist journalism because they didn't present the numbers the way you want? > US citizen gets droned under Obama  I don't get this, who cares if he was a US citizen, being an international terrorist supersedes this.  Yes, definitely. You think a SEAL team is just going to let people move about freely? That whole area was probably on lock down while the SEAL team did their thing looking for data and such. Depending on how bad her wound was applying pressure may not have cut it. Also the fact that a SEAL team member died ain't no way anyone was coming or going for a good couple hours most likely. Eh, if this were the argument we used during WWII, the Nazis would have won. the alqaeda members live close to their families wherever they are deployed.for every fighter u can count 2-5 more people close to him that is his family. im pretty happy his sons got killed too cause they cant copy their father and avenge him in their stupid manner. shame for the service man. Obama would Who also had paperwork for terrorist plots.  That is a much better article, thank you. So three different numbers so far. US said 0 civilians killed initially, Aljazeera says 10 women and children, and a ""Yemeni official"" says 15.  Tbh even Obama thought it was weird that he got it. Unpopular, but there wasn't nearly the outcry.  Still, if partisanship is what it takes to get us to stop murdering innocent people in other countries so be it.  This shit is unacceptable no matter who is in office. Sigh.   If you read the executive order itself, it bans people from countries listed as nations of concern in a law signed by Obama. This is the *only* part of the order that IMO is fine, so why this myth survives when the rest of the order is terrible.  Yeah def nothing to do with the billions of dollars worth of weapons Obama sold to them or anything. Def has to be the trump hotels! /s Did Obama have hotels and towers in Suadi Arabia?  No, he didn't. The reason Trump is all goody-goody with Saudi Arabia is because it has been the status-quo for the past decade+. Saudi Arabia has large amounts of oil and buys a metric fuck-ton of our weapons. To imply that Trump is being nice to Saudi Arabia simply because he himself has business interests over there shows you know very little about geopolitics and are just trying way to hard to push your narrative. Not tongue in cheek, just outright false maybe its the [military bases](https://militarybases.com/saudi-arabia/) we have there ey? if you don't want trumpets to have bias try to not have one either.  Let's put a Trump hotel in every country so that we can finally achieve world peace.  Are you not going to respond to the guy below who pointed out the list was created by Obama in 2015? Not putting Saudi Arabia on the list had nothing to do with a Trump conflict of interest, and everything to do with the Saudis having oil. I highly doubt it has anything to do with condos or hotels or whatever the fuck. Dudes a *billionaire*. You think he cares about his individual building investments when he probably has so many, that he has a team of people keeping track of them? You should probably run for president being as how you are far more competent/smart than the current president.  > Access that has been threatened by global warming.  Don't go there.  That's way too complicated for people that just read their Facebook feed and the headlines. I think you should re-read my post. No one on the left got upset when Obama got us involved with Yemen because he was on your team. How many posts were there on here talking about Obama's death toll as he left office? The previous post pointed out the Yemen conflict is currently around 5000, and so far Trump is only responsible for 10. Highlighting that it's a little silly to only start to care about it now that Trump is in office.  I am neither a Democrat nor a Republican. But I much prefer a Republican president because when team blue is in charge everyone is pro-war. At least when team red has the presidency there's a voice in the corner saying we shouldn't be involved. War is a necessary evil sometimes. And I'd struggle to call what the US has been doing with drones a ""War"".  Granted this is personal anecdote, something I hate, but the people around me were mad about Obama getting the peace price. The only place I didn't see people going crazy was on reddit and I think that's part of the problem. A lot of people only come here for their news and follow the dialogues that both sides present here.   I think it's safe to say they've changed the public narrative - warhawks are not popular any more. Republicans in 2012 & 2016 campaigned openly saying the war was a mistake. If you look at 2004 and now, how many more people are against war now? While we're at it, us telling the Saudis where to drop the bombs we sold them doesn't help either.   It's almost like we're manufacturing terrorism to keep the wars going Forget drone strikes. They put troops on the ground which I assume would only happen when the possibility of collateral damage is high enough that the proposition of risking American lives begins to make sense. I'm not a military expert by any means, but I'd love to hear an explanation for some of these reports. so we should just let terrorists roam free and frolic and let them create plots against the west? They get it - they've always gotten it.  They want to ""eliminate terrorism"" like Pfizer wants to ""eliminate diabetes.""   > You could even say that drones are even less humane.  In what way And in a GOP debate. What bout those of us who care about it all, going all the way back to Bush? Or we don't count? >You know, in a sense Obama was more dangerous than Trump could ever be. Obama was too damn charismatic. People didn't really care about his warcrimes.  No, they were more concerned that his skin was the wrong color, that he was born in the wrong country (although he would still be a US citizen regardless), and he might secretly have worshipped a different imaginary sky daddy then them, despite him attending the same type of imaginary sky daddy facility as everyone else.  Humanity.  What a species.   I'm not entirely sure you know the definition of a war crime.  War crimes are nothing new to presidency. Don't act like it was limited to Obama.  They are both charismatic, just to their own sides. Who was Obama Mr. Nice to? The unquestioning left, i.e. half the nation. Who fumed at the mouth for the the 8 years he was in office? The questioning right, i.e. half the nation.   Now Trump is in and who is he Mr. Charismatic to? The unquestioning right, i.e. half the nation. And who is taking their turn to fume at the mouth? The questioning left, i.e. half the nation.  I've been here. Liberals used to preach with righteous indignation about surveillance, drone strikes and war. When Obama was elected these subjects were suddenly moved to the ""oh well, it's bad but what can you do?"" category. Bush and Obama are the fathers of ISIS thanks to their destructive wars but, oh well, what can you do? You're right, a drone would just turn her and her entire family into dust. You hear that? Dozens! DOZENS I SAY! They are serious. And stop calling them Shirley. And if they do, then they'll only have to complain once. Afterwards you'll never hear any complaints from them anymore. Isn't it nice to see how fast the government can take care of the complaints of its own people? Wish we had a system as effective as that. *You have become a moderator of /r/pyongyang.* Most North Koreans do complain, when they're given any opportunity. It's ridiculous how North Korea has the fewest complaints.  Theyre obviously doing something right.  I can't wait for Kim to come free us from the tyranny of this world.  unfortunately, a non-zero amount of people did. i don't know exactly how much of his voter base thought this, but i just know it's greater than zero. Dronestrikes kill people cause they're crazy untargeted shit.  Not talking about human shields or civilians running interference for terrorists. sorry, we'll post fox news next time. What is their agenda? What do you consider a respected news source?  Your Facebook feed? See ya at the Brietbart and Fox comments section brother! /s Very compelling discourse, you should run for POTUS. You mean because he was black and Democrat. Partly his approval numbers.  I think mostly it's the timing of the Muslim/non-Muslim ban (depending on which side you're on).  I don't know about mainstream media, but left-leaning online news networks did criticize him for it a lot. And pretty much every liberal person I know has at some point brought it up. Maybe you just haven't actually tried speaking to liberals about it. Drone strikes and not closing Guantanamo are almost always the two things liberals bring up when they talk about how Obama disappointed them. I know that.  The point is people also criticized Obama for his interventions, especially in regards to drone strikes. Then how do you know it happened? I mean I know Americans got caught in the old ""we have to choose who is less bad"" situation this past election. But even if Clinton would have done similar things, I doubt she would have been THIS bad.  Justifies what? Your comment makes no sense. This raid is just another example of the U.S killing civilians, assigning it to Trump in some way ignores that this has been happening for a very long time.  But never mind, the left would rather complain that people are using a cartoon frog to mock them. And whether they're refugees or not Then he would automatically become an enemy combatant.  IMAGINE https://youtu.be/Ao461iG9UsA I think he's referring to the fact that the articles always mentions women in hopes that we mourn for them and not the men. Distrust of the media is so high since the election cycle that people are starting to look for conspiracies where there are none.   Oh, they said 10 women and children instead of enumerating the victims' age, gender, race, height, and weight? Why are they withholding information from us? What narrative are they pushing? >You really think this is sensationalist journalism because they didn't present the numbers the way you want?  It says in the article that the number comes from local medics. Idk why this is considered unreliable. It doesn't say ""U.S. soldiers kill 10 women and children with evil grins on faces,"" it just says what's been reported So we are going to get a women and children day by day death count now because Trump is in office. Where the fuck were these assholes when Obama was dropping thousands of drone strikes over the course of 8 years. I guess the women and children don't matter if a Democrat is the one murdering them. Because we have the constitution that guarantees due process for things like this. Because US citizens get their day in court regardless of how shitty they are. If Dahmer and Bundy have their day in court, so does Anwar, the point being that, regardless of how bad your crime is, you have rights as a US citizen. At least, that is my understanding. Really? I really don't know the specifics of seal raids but doesn't the word raid lead one to believe it is done rather quickly? Right but we aren't fighting the Nazis. If we didn't bomb these people today(or when it happened), what exactly is the result of that? Are they going to take control of some scientists, planes, material, engineers etc and create an Army that can overtake ours? If we didn't bomb them, would they have the chance to march down Penn avenue and take the White House? Of course not. This war is not about survival. If we sat back and did nothing, what would happen? We aren't going to die tomorrow because we didn't bomb those innocent people. I feel like too many people forget this. Terrorists by definition can *not* win against the country they are terrorizing. They can only instill fear into the people, and by that measure get them to change the way their government handles things.   We aren't fighting for our life(they don't have planes or ships to get to us), our freedoms(we have lost more freedoms in fighting them due to our own government and fear aka terrorists are winning in this regard), or much of anything(we've spent countless lives and treasure to achieve what exactly?). So I have to ask what exactly are we fighting for? Uh. Yemen has no navy. You don't fight terrorism by killing innocent people, that just creates more terrorists. Germany was a threat to the entire world. You fight terrorism with policing and intelligence:  http://archive.lewrockwell.com/browne/browne63.html Not even remotely comparable situations. These 'members of al qaeda' (whatever determines that right now in a place like Yemen) are an ideological threat not a military threat. Killing innocent people fuels their message if it's one that blames the west. A good thing to do would be to support sovereign governments that are invested in stability and suppress terrorism. Overthrowing these types of governments, contributing to violence and disorder, and killing innocent people with our identifiable bombs is definitely the wrong way to stop terrorism. Why don't we get the whole three generations of their family just to make sure no one comes against us, like how North Korea does it. Just to be clear, in the future, they don't hate you for your freedoms, they hate you because you don't give a shit when you kill children. This casual disregard for the lives of children disgusts me. Trump also, it seems.  Yes because theres a really fine line between terrorism and defending yourself from your abusive government and the foreign powers that support it. That line being which brand of nationalism you slavishly follow. > US said 0 civilians killed initially  ""We kill terrorists, we killed these people. They must be terrorists not civilians. Simple logic."" Note that US reports any males above a certain age (14?) as combatants regardless of any evidence against then, which is why only children under 14 and women are reported as civilians. I meant that as more of a dig against the Nobel than Obama  I don't know what you mean about a partnership.  Honest question here, wasn't that law under Obama simply to enforce restrictions and add an interview to the visa process? In order to combat this 'myth', can you explain then why Obama wouldn't have listed other known terror-related countries, such as Saudi Arabia, for such restrictions? It's not a myth, it's verifiable.  Obama never banned these countries.  His DHS compliled the list, yes, but Obama never put it into effect (this was an ExO, not a law).  What he did was restrict travel for Iraqis after a credible threat was discerned.  Restricted travel means a tougher vetting process, but not a complete ban.  The ""it's Obama's doing"" is the real myth.  Of course, SA is a strategic and economic ally.  They sell oil in USD which bolsters our economy, and host US bases.  If you want to rebut these arguments, stop trying to finger-point Obama and instead focus on the facts of the US-SA relationship. Why is Trump using a list of countries made by Obama when he was accused of being a secret Muslim who was actually trying to weaken the US for his entire presidency? Didn't Trump always claim he had new plans and better information? That part of the order isn't *fine*. It's hypocritical to attack Trump for the countries on the list and not also attack Obama, but that doesn't excuse Trump from using the list. It's because Trump is trying to pass himself off as some kind of great leader who isn't afraid to be non-PC and will always put America First^TM . But then he bows to Saudi Arabia and Russia and it becomes clear he's just copying what people before him have done or whatever his masters tell him to do.  US held on to GITMO in spite of having hostile relations with the host country. What is KSA going to do? Attack a US military installation? This is how you get Freedom. Hooray I guess... ???  Go look back on /r/news and /r/worldnews and search for Yemen, there were plenty of top posts absolutely eviscerating the US and Saudi Arabia for their brutality.  And if you want to see what the left thought of all this, go see all the articles *The Intercept* has published on Yemen in the past few years, or go search for Yemen in /r/socialism and /r/anarchism  Keeps a lot of folk rich for sure. Humane might have been the wrong word. Maybe sympathetic? I'm not sure. I'd rather know that I was shot by some US commando than blown to bits by a speck in the sky piloted by a dude in an armchair half way across the world.  Take [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/18/life-as-a-drone-pilot-creech-air-force-base-nevada) of a drone pilot for an example.  And according to his stack of executive orders  Leftist scum quit ruining the circle jerk Leftists ""caring"" about Obama:  > ""Eh, this is bad I suppose. He should probably stop it.""  Leftists ""Caring"" about Trump:  > THIS IS THE FUCKING END OF THE WORLD HOLY FUCK SOMEONE ASSASSINATE HIM OR SOMETHING 1776!!!!!!! It's what ever the winning side says is a war crime I never said such a thing. It's a problem all charismatic presidents share. Really? Because I've been here too and there was always a vocal minority condemning the surveillance state and endless war. I'm not sure if you've noticed, but the news stories on these attacks are always *kind of* high, but rarely get *really high* in points. I expect the same for the tenure of the Trump administration.  To the left, FOX News is less unbiased than a propaganda rag owned by a literal slave state, Qatar. The Associated Press, Reuters, sometimes the BBC but they've been biased on occasion.  Breitbart, Trump's twitter feed and Infowars probably.  What would you know about compelling discourse reading rags like that? I'm glad they did, but I didn't see much of it. And yes I've talked to the so called liberals, they stole the name btw. I don't see many of them caring about personal liberty. You can hate Trumps warmongering and Obamas warmongering at the same time fam Its only hypocrisy if I believe Obama's bombing were justified and A-ok. Which I don't.  Where did he say it was ok when Obama did it, again? My point is, killing civilians cannot be justified regardless of what former POTUS did. I guess I misunderstood your earlier comment. wasn't this in their home country? - so not refugees by definition? He is already automatically an enemy combatant. The Obama administration considered all men above the age of 15 to be a terrorist by default, I don't imagine Trump being humane enough to change that and if he does he would probably just make it even more ridiculous. ""Funny"" thing is, any males over the age of 14 or so that are killed during raids like this are considered 'enemy combatants.'  Just think about that.  What reason do these people have NOT to fight against the US, if the US is just going to count them as enemies no matter what they do? Revenge is a product of young anger. Good video, but that dude's voice is so fucking annoying. He sounds like an amateur YouTuber trying to do a Jigsaw impersonation for his parody video. >[**IMAGINE! China Invades America!

I see now  You mean woman I don't know dies?   Idk, it's better than a child dying, probably the same as a man dying. I mean they want to be equals right? I'll care about them equally as less. I care most about the children that can't even figure out why so many people are trying to kill them. This is really it.  The number of time's I've read ""WHY DIDN'T THEY REPORT THAT DURING OBAMA"" over the past month in response to thorough journalism is mind boggling.  Reading the news is no longer about information, it's now about figuring out ""whose side"" the article is on. What narrative are people pushing here by attempting to derail a tragedy into pointless bickering about how many dead kids there are?       Its amazing people have turned this into le bias media circlejerk. Who gives a fuck, children have been killed \\\_()_/  Unfortunately, for too many people reading the news is no longer about information, it's now about figuring out ""whose side"" the article is on. If you missed the outcry about drone strikes during Obama's administration you are woefully uninformed. first of all ppl spoke out against drone strikes for years, the media just portrait it like this if they can get a reaction out of ppl, like they did with you...  and 2nd, even if ppl didnt care back then, are they not allowed to learn from history and change their minds ?   He had the option of returning for a fair trial and decided to hide out in Yemen.  I think the policy operates under the idea that because we are not fighting a conventional war, someone still sacrifices that right by virtue of making themselves enemy combatants, albeit not in a traditional field of battle but instead by plotting terrorist attacks.  In the past, a traitor to the US fighting for the Germans at Normandy would be cannon fodder just like any other Nazi.  There would be no trial.  But since we don't have battles like that with this enemy, their logic is that although Anwar was not on a battle field, he was the same classification of enemy as an enemy who suits up and fires at marines.  Not saying its right or wrong, but thats some of the logic behind why Dahmer and Bundy did not sacrifice their rights to trial while people engaged in a slow, terroristic war against the US under an enemy flag do sacrifice those rights. It evidently went to shit. One of them died, which means there was an active fight going on even with the drone strike before or during. Then they searched the area looking for documents/computers/data. One of them dies which means medical aid had to be rendered. I'm betting it took a lot longer then they intended. Raids are a general term used by the military for a battle drill. Although speed can be (and often is) a factor, the overall defining factor that differentiates a raid from another drill is the fact that your are not seizing or occupying an objective to hold or gain ground. It's a deliberate assault done with specific mission criteria with intent to leave after objectives are met. A raid as defined by modern terms can last hours.  Well, war is what makes the bankers and military industrial complex filthy fucking rich. That's why we're really at war here. If the war was having the opposite effect,  forcing bankers and the military industrial complex to lose money, we would be out of this war within 48 hours. That's what the carpet bombs are for. they could also send them the bill for the bullets like China does Sadly not far from the truth.  The US also reports any woman in the same room / building as an armed man a combatant.  Saudi Arabia is still one of the largest oil producers and sells oil in USD.  Petro dollars are important to our economy.  They are also a strategic ally in the region and host US bases.  In other words, there are very real economic and militaristic concerns with pissing off SA regardless of which party is in office.  That said, DHS put together the list of countries during Obama's admin.  It didn't go into effect during his term, however.  He did restrict travel for Iraqis, which just means, as you said, adding an interview to the visa process.  He never prevented them from entering the country, and he did it in response to what he considered a credible threat. From the outset, let's look at the list:  Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.  The reason many of these nations are on the list is obvious. ISIS is strong in Syria and Iraq and has a significant presence in Libya. Yemen and Somalia are embroiled in conflict with terrorists involved. Sudan has had several conflicts in recent years that literally split the country in two (South Sudan now exists) that have recently started to cool down (one of Obama last acts was lifting some sanctions). And Iran is also obvious.   As for why Saudi Arabia isn't on the list, blame the Bipartisan Convention on Foreign Policy. Both sides of the aisle like the country for some stupid reason. IIRC Obama had $500 billion in foreign arms sales during his presidency, and Saudi Arabia came in top of the list with over $200 billion ($218 billion is sticking in my head). The only way that changes is getting a viable third party to challenge this convention, and with our current voting system that's a pipe dream.  Quoting [this CNN piece](http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/how-the-trump-administration-chose-the-7-countries/index.html)  >In December 2015, President Obama signed into law a measure placing limited restrictions on certain travelers who had visited Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or Syria on or after March 1, 2011. Two months later, the Obama administration added Libya, Somalia, and Yemen to the list, in what it called an effort to address ""the growing threat from foreign terrorist fighters.""  This was part of a 2,000 page $1.1 trillion spending bill and originally was part of HR 158. This is now officially part of [the US code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1187).  Since when has Trump been consistent? The way you have sculpted this sentends leaves absolutely no positive action Trump can do. http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/23/us/drone-pilots-found-to-get-stress-disorders-much-as-those-in-combat-do.html I don't normally do this but your username is amazing and also somehow appropriate for this comment.  This guy knows the definition of a war crime.  Well if both are entirely biased we get nowhere arguing which is less unbiased.  On occasion?  They're all bias in their own way.  Best to get info from all sides of any situation. That's my guess. In fact, hating Obama's and not Trump's is hypocritical.  Reddit never seemed to care when Obama did it, but of course we need to make a big deal when it happens under trump. That's the hypocrisy he was pointing out. It amazes me that Trump is deemed racist and Obama did this and no one really cares. Then you blame Trump for not changing it.  12, not 15.   All males 12 and over are automatically enemy combatants by shitty definition meant to reduce the civilian casualty numbers. Out of curiosity what was the age limit for Bush when he invaded Iraq? I think that definition dates back to W's administration. Obama continued it, which makes him also culpable, of course. When did Obama say that? I'm a Marine who served under Obama and was never told that order. Source on the age of 15 to be terrorist, please? Yea we create more ""terrorists"" than we kill. I know! What's worse is that it was a Ron Paul campaign ad.. but it seemed too applicable and relevant in this certain situation. It was a little poorly written so I edited it to make more sense lol There's some people on the right saying this out of partisan concerns but also many people on the far left saying this, who have been aware of Obama's murderous policies for years and are frustrated and annoyed when Trump being elected is what it takes for liberals in the US to suddenly become anti-war again.  Most of the people complaining about Trump's policies arent anti-war, they don't genuinely care about whats going on in Yemen, they are ANTI-TRUMP. Once Trump is out of office in 4 or 8 years, they will once again fade away and stop caring about all the brown people being murdered in Yemen, Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine, Egypt, and all the other places the US has taken a massive stinking shit on so that corporate interests can be served above all else. And thats the central problem, all of this political theatre is a massive sheepdogging effort between democrats and republicans to make it a democrat vs. republican issue, when in reality is a **basic humanity vs. sociopathic international business interests** issue. I have to reevaluate my views now. And once you get a feeling that it's on the wrong side, you can ignore it. See: CNN, NYT = fake news. Ehh all I hear is"" yeah but like Obama totally tried to minimize it so it's not as bad, shit happens"" vs ""TRUMP IS LITERALLY KILLING BABIES WITH NO REMORSE""... That's true. Yes, but that point isn't the point people like toboggan want to hear. Conservatives who support the war say we should be in there to save 'Murica and mah freedoms. I haven't heard a single conservative make a good argument for these wars and how they relate to those two things.  Do you have a source for this? Why is Iran an obvious choice for being on the list? Genuine question here, I was under the impression that Iran was pretty civilized compared to the shitstorms its neighbors have to deal with. Iran isn't obvious at all. If it is to combat Isis they don't even follow the same branch of Islam. They are Shia while Isis is Sunni.  And by banning people traveling from Iran to enter your country you are banning people that are leaving Islam behind. All Iranians I know are Persians that left their country because they are critical of Islam. What are you getting for hindering them to enter the states? Thank you for an respectful answer. With everything going on and everyone pointing fingers, I'd like to have an actual idea of what is going on rather than blindly following certain beliefs/opinions. This gives me a good basis in which to continue researching. I'm confused as to what your point is, placing limited restrictions on certain travelers who had visited those countries is nowhere near the same thing as a blanket ban of all non-American citizens who hold citizenship to those countries, regardless of their legal status as permanent residents. If you're trying to make the claim Obama did it, you're being intentionally dishonest. Wasn't it only congress that can write spending bills? When did Obama get that kind of power, wow! I would think he would want to distance himself from anything Obama did since he called him one of the worst presidents and said foreign policy was a complete disaster.  There are a ton of things he could be doing that would be positive. Starting with surrounding himself with the best and most qualified, like he promised.  Thank you and allow me to take this opportunity to remind everyone that a federation assassin had to play dead like a ferengi in order to murder the true savior of the Alpha Quadrant and install Martok the coward as chancellor, who immediately took Captain Sisko's advice to relentlessly press the attack, which was the same strategy that Chancellor Gowron was already pursuing like any Klingon with a warrior's heart in their chest would have.   You mean the left will stop complaining about RT too? I mean, AJ and RT are peas in a pod. You have it all wrong. They aren't complaining about the bombing, they're complaining about the fact that Trump supporters won't condemn it specifically because it was done by Trump and not Obama. *That's* the hypocrisy.  I recall a lot of people decrying indiscriminate bombing.  Obama killed 996 civilians in this same region.  It amazes me that Obama is getting flak for killing civilians but Trump supporters are perfectly fine with their guy doing it. I've been very outspoken about Obama's foriegn policy and have called him a terrorist every chance I've gotten. He has murdered up to 4000 of my countrymen in his tenure in cold blood. I hate the man as much as New Yorkers hate Osama Bin Laden, probably more cause atleast most of the world openly denounced Bin Laden. But atleast Obama has the sense to cover up his thoughts with pretty words, Trump doesn't even do that which rightfully leads me to believe he will be worse in regards to his foreign policy since he doesn't even believe the middle east, north Africa and other muslim countries to be worth his politeness.  Except people DID care, stop distorting reality. Obama isn't president anymore. Whatever Trump does now is his fault. Not defending Obama, but Trump was deemed a racist by his behavior from the 2 years prior to today, not because of this raid. > and no one really cares.  Well that's not true at all, and ignores the past 8 years. That's just a lie. Lots of people cared about Obama's actions killing people, but it was ignored.   On the right nobody wanted to attack him for killing civilians, since the only criticism they would entertain is that he was too soft on terrorism.   On the left there were plenty of critics, but they were all considered to be so ""far left"" that nobody bothered to listen to them. Neither the mainstream centrist democrats, nor the republicans had any reason to want to give them a platform, so everyone just pretended they didn't exist.  Obama may have killed brown people abroad, every leader in history seemingly has. It's fucked up, but Obama hasn't discriminated against people of color in his business and personal life. Source? Not trying to be a dick, I just can't find much on the definitions of enemy combatants being that well defined.  For drone and air strikes Tons of people are saying ""why didn't you care when Obama was bombing all these countries?""  Umm, I always care about that shit.  You are only listening now. Journalism isn't a ""feeling"" fyi. If you think NYT is fake news, you are going to have a very rough life. No one is saying that. You're trying to turn a discussion about drone casualties into an argument about voter outcry, which is both asinine and pointless imo. Go to r/elections if that's how reading the news works for you. Perhaps you are purposefully reading right wing news sources? Confirmation bias?  I saw it, I remember all my former friends being so opposed to the Iraq war and our overall involvement in the problems of the middle east, then Obama became president and silence. I was still pissed at all the continued policies. But overall the left disintegrated. I'm extremely bitter about it.   Now they are coming out of the wood work again because the media tells them to be outraged by it, as if it never happened during the Obama administration. I have a complete disdain for the media and main stream democrats with their manufactured outrage. Well, yea. Its idiotic to genuinly believe that we are somehow fighting for our freedoms in some goat village halfway around the world.  I don't disagree.  I'm not a fan of SA.  I was not attempting to justify, only explain.  I'm aware of SA's complicity in 9/11 and the 28 pages. Iran doesn't belong on the list, at all. They're an oasis of logic and reason. While their government is a little Islamic in law, their people are very progressive.  Iran is on the official [US State Sponsors of Terrorism list](https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/2015/257520.htm). This is the most current version, and had Obama not reopened ties with Cuba they too would be part of this ban.   Is the phantom enemy to keep spotlight of KSA. The thing that none of these answers seem to understand is that Iran is a major geopolitical adversary in the middle East in our foreign policy objective of controlling oil pipelines. The Yemen and Syrian conflicts are fought against iranian-backed regimes, with the Houthi rebels currently in control of Yemen's capital and Assad being armed by Iran. That's why our state department has them listed as a major state sponsor of terrorism. It's not about Isis or how they're Sunnis extremists, since as we know Iran is a Shiite theocracy. It's about how they specifically antagonize us in our foreign policy objectives. The Strait of Hormuz goes between the Saudi Gulf Peninsula and Iran and accounts for 11% of the world's daily oil trade. Control of that Strait is absolutely critical for the Western World. Thus our alliance with the Saudi's and sponsorship of their bombing campaign against Yemen, who, again, are currently in a civil war due to iranian-backed Houthi rebels controlling Yemen's capital.  >Iran isn't obvious at all.   Official state sponsor of terrorism, along with Syria and Sudan. Add Iraq and you have the first four countries Obama put on the list.   >If it is to combat Isis they don't even follow the same branch of Islam. They are Shia while Isis is Sunni.  ISIS isn't the only Islamic terror group. The two relevant here are Hamas and Hezbollah.   >And by banning people traveling from Iran to enter your country you are banning people that are leaving Islam behind. All Iranians I know are Persians that left their country because they are critical of Islam. What are you getting for hindering them to enter the states?  The original rules Obama signed allowed people to come from these countries with extra scrutiny. As I have said elsewhere in this chain, I do not support a total ban, even a temporary one.  I personally keep [this](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions) open in a separate tab on my phone. It may take a couple days (particularly over a weekend: this ban isn't up yet), but reading the *actual* order helps cut through much of the spin found in many news articles. For example, many claimed [this memo](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/23/presidential-memorandum-regarding-hiring-freeze) as an attack on the EPA.  My point is solely Trump did not choose countries based on where he had businesses. The list came from Obama's administration, and if you want to place stricter restrictions on certain countries than this list is the obvious and least-controversial choice.   The rest of the order, however, is, to put it mildly, a bad idea for a dozen reasons. They only other part I could agree with us the ""come up with a plan"" part (which does not automatically preclude status quo, but odds are it will be stricter and quite possibly too strict, we will see). Banning people from those countries, even temporarily, is a stupid idea, one any advisor could have told Trump would do nothing to aid his goal. Restricting the number of refugees is also a bad idea: IMO, even if we have to build camps like the ones used for the Japanese until they are vetted or can be sent home (a worst case scenario I wouldn't support, but I often use worse case scenarios to make a point), no matter how bad the conditions are  it's better than letting them die in a warzone. There are hundreds of less-extreme steps and the US refugee vetting process as-is isn't exactly easy. There are plenty of places to attack this ban without resorting to lies and fake news.  U talking about Worf as the federation assassin?? I dunno about all that noise.... Republicans, sure. Not the Obama fans that are now scrutinizing the same actions under trump That's not including people who were innocents but labeled as enemy combatants to make the numbers look better.  He didn't kill civilians, the military did.  Well, Republicans did not even want to believe that Obama was American since his father was not American. Oddly enough they have no problem with Trumps mother being German. You could almost believe there were traces of racism behind it... You're going to have to prove your claims, while there's an estimated 111 plus civilians that died, there are not 4000 estimated civilians. Here's a question for you: How many of your other countrymen would those 4000 have killed? How many men, women, and children are alive today because those 4000 aren't?   Edit: His 4000 number is horse shit. It's between 380 and 801. https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2016/07/01/obama-drone-casualty-numbers-fraction-recorded-bureau/  Edit 2: His ""source"" is an RT article that says that 4000 people have been killed in ALL countries by BOTH Obama and Bush. Despite not being a credible source from the get go, his own source proves him wrong.  Here's this idiot's source for his ""4000"" number. Notice it's in ALL countries, and across both the Bush and Obama administrations, AND it's from RT. So, not at ALL his ""countrymen"" and not at ALL ""Obama's foriegn policy.""  https://www.rt.com/usa/349194-civilians-killed-drone-number/ Yikes. Someones living in an alternative reality.  Nothing Obama did was unlawful so how could he be a terrorist. But there wasn't the outcry.  > Obama isn't president anymore. Whatever Trump does now is his fault.  You should say this to the folks at /r/WayOfTheBern  Or do you give Bernie supporters a pass? Doesn't the fact that your views are more visible now imply exactly his point, though?   Yeah, sure there were people that always had those views like you, but they didn't receive nearly as many upvotes back then. Some might have even been downvoted. Heh, Trump and his inner circle seem to be doing pretty well.   (Seriously though, just continuing my sarcasm - and for almost everyone denying facts/reality eventually has consequences) It's real outrage.  We really hate war and killing brown people.  We hate taking and not giving. I was always mad about the drone strikes.  I am mad that Osama Bin Laden was ""killed and his body dumped in the ocean.""  WTF?  Why?  What happened to the constitution? And yet, here we are.  They are also the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism , just not targeted against the US in most cases.  >a little Islamic in law       I don't support Iran being on this list but let's not get into apologia here. Iran is literally (and I mean literally) a theocracy.  It is actually funny, I know many Iranian that I would actually say is Islamophobic here in Sweden. It is very understandable because of what have happend to their country but some people can't get a bit surprised by it. To say that these people are terrorists are beyond stupid. Iran has been a sort of scapegoat for alot of people as the defacto evil islam country. Their old regime was really what got them the bad rap. To be honest; pakistan shouldve been there instead of iran. It is widely known that they are a dafe haven for al queda and other terrorist organizations. Being on an official list means nothing. We have countless stupid policies and lists like this which are purely political. That list is purely political, the only ""terrorists"" Iran supported were fighting defensive wars against us and our allies.   Yea, I didn't mean to come across as if Irans government are innocent small school children. I have enough Iranian acquaintance to know that is far from the truth. But I feel that this ban will so far more harm than good. It sounds like we agree with each other. Fair enough, I don't buy the notion that it was picked because of his hotels either. The relationship between the US and those countries in that region, both on and off the list, have been this way for many administrations.  I will say that despite not buying the claim about this issue, I do think its a poignant point to make concerning Trumps business interests and the dangers of not actually divesting himself from them like he should have been forced to. r/politics was full of anti-indiscriminate bombing rhetoric when it was first starting.  Thing is, we don't really know. Assumptions are made, not for accuracy, but yeah, to look good. That's the problem when you kill first and make assessments later.  ""Kill them all, let ~~God~~ my PR department sort it out."" He's the commander in chief. It's his responsibility.  Even if he isn't directly responsible, it doesn't stop Trump supporters from posting shit like [this.](http://i.imgur.com/X42rqI9.jpg)  Either Trump and Obama both are responsible, or neither of them are. Trumpets can't have it both ways. Estimated 111 by Americans... I was talking about the number of innocent civilians killed not the terrorists. Also how do I know the people the US considers to be terrorists are infact terrorists? They've threatened to bomb the country back into the stoneage before, they consider all males above 15 to be terrorists as far as I'm concerned their going in completely blind.   If your going to justify terrorism like this then why is 9/11 considered to be terrorism? OBL was only retaliating due to american imperialism and against american support of a racist and facist regime in the middle east. Are you going to say he was justified too? No because he killed innocent people. I don't give a fuck about Obama's reasoning he killed up to 4000 INNOCENT CIVILIANS nothing justifies that, nothing. Don't want to bring it up so early but:  Nothing Hitler did was unlawful based on laws that he created. Murdering 4000 civillians in a soverign country is unlawful. And thats only one country. Osama Bin Laden murdered less than 3000 yet he was still considered a terrorist. Yes there was. Even on media. I say it to who I encounter. While I correct you ESS Trolls (yes all ESS trolls were tagged by the RES plugin so we all know who you are, as were other troll hate subs) whenever you lie (which is sadly every post), I don't make public declarations. If WayOfTheBern was added to my feed I'm sure I'd correct them occasionally too. How are my views more visible?  I was always and will always be against war.  There isn't much visibility in America for anti-war protesting. Complacency and acceptance have eroded our sense of social responsibility  :/ utterly destroyed by taking too much of our own kind of drug.

Sure some the fear is just paranoia and you will almost definitely be completely fine living in a building with asbestos somewhere in its fabric, but why the fuck would you use it to build anything new or place workers lives under any excess risk. Asbestosis is no joke The anti-Russian propaganda train is running out of ideas. We went from frightening, to scandalous and now to the downright ridiculous.  #bringbackasbestos WTF kind of scam will the Russians think up next? The Italian mafia is behind weed & cement, the Korean mafia is in the protection racket, the Bikies mafia controls hard drugs, the Ozzie mafia controls gambling.... so what?

Russia sucks!! I worked for the qld state gov about 7 years ago, what makes me laugh is that they had shutdown and sealed a number of qld state gov buildings because of... asbestos lol. Your tax dollar at work. Australia, eh? Maybe you too need STRONG RULER like Mr Trump to stop your Senate saying such naughty things. Trump does : http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_581b2e4ee4b0570d6d6f0c1d  He even said that anti-asbesto movements are supported by the mob in a bizarre yet very common reversal recently. Except in Rise of the Triad, the asbestos armor is pretty good. >""It's commonly known within the anti-asbestos movement internationally that the pro-asbestos lobby is the Russian mafia,"" says union worker      ^ what the shit sources are these?   Why can't the mob ever be doing good things?  Like there is no reason the mob couldn't be helping venezuelans convert their currency into non-shit ones, or running olive oil manufacturing businesses that ignore some silly overly onerous restrictions.  Or bringing pornography to countries that ban it.  There is so much illegal shit you could be doing that is actually a good thing (thanks to so many shitty countries with so many shitty laws).  Surely you could make money as an ethical criminal.  But noooo.  You can't help refugees get to safety... you have to sell them into sex slavery or dump them off rickety boats into the oceans.  You can't help smuggle porn into countries with crazy restrictions - you have to deal in CP, or loan sharking.  And being pro-esbestos?   WTF, its like these criminals are sitting back in some room and going ""Hey what can we do that is evil today?""  Like is there even any money in the esbestos industry? ""They won't get far""? It's been used under the radar in a hospital and government building already. Some people in Canada would be very happy to support it. Now she is given $336,000 a year to inflict her cruelty on the Australian population. Russians directed the Star Wars prequels! Obama, Hillary--- although you could say she was doing backdoor deals with them, despite all the *allegations* of trump working with them, you check into Wikileaks with her little behind closed doors uranium deal.  http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html You own an asbestos mine, you're pro asbestos.  Easy. ""Anybody pro-aids? Pro-aids anybody...?"" It saves money, and it's quite unlikely to kill you if you're not building or living in the place. Fun fact: there is a town in Ontario famous for its asbestos mines and industry, from which it gets it name Asbestos.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos,_Quebec Where they mine Asbest as they can!  Please clap. Awesome! So the ancient greeks that gave asbestos its name must have been there!! Wow, you are really on to something! I mean, they did have colonies around the Black sea but that far into Russia!! Who knew!! Asbestos in India is a $2b a year industry. It's promoted as cheap housing products for the poor (also cuts down on welfare needed for the elderly). Russians apparently. happy cakeday! Nothing ridiculous about a business-minded president helping remove safety regulations in pursuit of that bottom dollar. Well... nothing ridiculous about the notion. As for the ethical reality, yeah, *that's* pretty goddamn ridiculous. Well people did try to blame the Russians when the computers at United Airlines crashed recently.  I think they hit the ""ridiculous"" ceiling"" when Russia was blamed for leaking spoilers for the *Sherlock* finale. I felt like I was in r/SubredditSimulator.   Actually I feel that way reading the headllne to this article too.  swedish not even in same category as 80's soviet olympic team. Where was sweden in Canada Cup? Sweden good yes, mad respect, but like Canada today, soviets were in 80's.  Tax dollars going towards protecting the public, such a disgrace. Dumbest comment I've read all week, without a doubt. Do we really need to reference Trump in every fucking thread? Malkom Turnbl stronk like bear >I believe that the movement against asbestos was led by the mob, because it was often mob-related companies that would do the asbestos removal. Great pressure was put on politicians, and as usual, the politicians relented.  >Throughout his career, Trump has demonstrated a distinct lack of compassion for asbestos victims, calling an anti-asbestos law stupid in his 1997 book and irresponsibly claiming asbestos is also 100 percent safe, once applied.  How on earth...?  there's that famous Trump projection again Is Canada still at it? I remember there being scandal involving their government's support of their asbestos exports despite banning it locally. Man, I had to check twice if I was reading the onion. Random thanks, I've been trying to remember the name of this game for SO long! You should know better in the Trump era about asking about sources lol Actually most of all refugee smuggling in Europe is done by different Mafias. The mafia in Italy is also involved in the olive oil business. They do a lot of things that are less shady or dark, but you don't hear about that because its not interesting. The different mafias do quite a bit of so called ""community"" work in order to exist in peace in the communities that they do. Organised crime has always had a strong component of helping local communities, because then there is no one to snitch about them. Of course this doesn't always hold true, but it is generally the case. http://www.villagevoice.com/restaurants/a-detail-about-mob-pizzeria-connections-that-new-york-magazine-missed-6569843 To be clear, there are several construction materials for buildings containing asbestos that are not banned, and with good reason. Areas where the asbestos has no chance of being flaked off into the air--such as cement sheeting--are harmless uses of asbestos. Now, if you know of hospitals and government buildings using asbestos in the paint or ceiling lining of room interiors, that's another matter altogether. You know what'd be great? If Tony Abbott got the most horrendous penis and ass cancer imaginable. In isolation, that statement is perfectly valid. That's it.. Prepare for war! Do you know how many agencies had to approve that? A shitload. It's not this shady backroom deal like you seem to think. In Australia we have had a significant number of asbestos related deaths of family members (wives and chrildren) who have come into contact with asbestos dust through the clothing of building and manufacturing workers, the consequences of its use is far reaching. It's in Quebec [Encore!](http://gph.is/18RX93f) Yes but a large quantity of that, the main supply I think, comes from Canada.  Edit: and we're going to stop exporting it. > also cuts down on welfare needed for the elderly  LOL  Edit: I feel bad about LOLing now >  (also cuts down on welfare needed for the elderly).  Killing them will do that. Look here fuck wad. They had whole multi-story buildings sealed off yet asbestos is still getting in. Take your smart arse remark and shove it up your self-righteous cock gobbling throat Real estate mogul.  It undercuts the bottom line. Some golden-hearted stripper should replace his coke with asbestos dust and see how compassionate he is then. [A Brief History of Donald Trump and the Mafia](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/a-brief-history-of-donald-trump-and-the-mafia)   >To help build his first big Manhattan project, the Grand Hyatt New York on East 42nd Street, Trump had chosen a notorious demolition company secretly owned in part, according to the FBI, by a top Philadelphia mobster who doubled as crime lord of Atlantic City. To pour concrete for the new hotel, Trump picked a firm run by a man named Biff Halloran, who was convicted a few years later for his role in what prosecutors dubbed a mob-run cartel that jacked up construction prices throughout the city. For the carpentry contract, Trump settled on a Genovese familycontrolled enterprise that was central to another mob price-fixing racket, as found by a subsequent federal probe.  >And then there was the person who had introduced Trump to the FBI agents in the first place. This was a six-foot-five bear of a man named Daniel Sullivan, a former Teamsters leader who was serving as what Trump called his ""labor consultant"" at the time. Sullivan wore other hats as well: He was partners with a reputed Atlantic City mobster named Kenneth Shapiro, who controlled the local scrap market and who was in the process of selling Trump a large plot of land at top dollar on which to build his casino.  [Trumps mob-linked ex-associate gives $5,400 to campaign](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/donald-trump-russia-felix-sater-227434)  >A Russian-born, mafia-linked businessman whose ties to both Donald Trump and loyalists of Russian President Vladimir Putin have sparked scrutiny, visited Trump Tower last month for undisclosed business, he told POLITICO.  >The businessman, Felix Sater, also donated the maximum allowable contribution to Trumps presidential campaign, according to the campaigns most recent FEC filing. [...]  >Around 1999, Sater joined Bayrock, a real estate firm that had offices in Trump Tower and pursued business ventures with Trump. Bayrock is now being rocked by allegations made in a lawsuit brought by a former executive of unexplained cash infusions from Russia and Kazakhstan and receiving financing from a firm used by Russians in favor with Putin. Around 2010, Sater went to work for Trump directly, carrying a Trump Organization business card that described him as a senior advisor to Donald Trump. Same guy that stated CFLs cause cancer and vaccines autism (edit: forgot, also: asbestos is 100% safe) He is impervious to empirical evidence. Pretty sure I saw a very very recent news were Canada was shuting down all their Asbesto import, exports and production. Seems it's planned for 2018 https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/12/15/canada-to-ban-asbestos-by-2018.html Are you implicitly talking about the law in USA? It sounds like you do, while this piece is about Australia.  How about when a water or gas pipe breaks and you need to drill the walls? Or a window frame renovation. Or an electricity renovation. Or when the building reaches EOL and needs to be torn down.  In any case, this reported find is not OK, since in Australia asbestos import has been banned from 2003.  The safest bet is to not have asbestos around at all. [Last I checked, there was quite a bit of Asbestos in the WTC.](https://www.asbestos.com/world-trade-center/) Wonder how all those New Yorkers felt about that. The poetic justice of contracting Asbestosis is a little too unlikely, unfortunately. It's only shady if the other party does it. even the wiki link has Quebec in it. lol So the Quebec mafia must be in on this too.  In 2009 Canada exported 9% of the worlds asbestos, 2015 it was effectively 0%, great job on Canada for removing  itself from the despicable asbestos trade. Unfortunately this will not help the untouchables in India as Russia exports over 50% of the worlds asbestos,and if there is a Ruble to be made I can't see Russia stopping the mining and exporting of it any time soon.  Well it it's any better. Without cheap housing made by asbestos the poor in India will not live long enough to become elderly and die due to asbestos.  What a civil discussion, very inspiring... Control your emotions, you're acting like a child. Hmmm, yes, interesting. You make a good point. How exactly do you shove something *up* your throat? We don't all spend our lives upside down with cocks in our mouth like you It's only the dust and fibers which are dangerous.  If you can safely get around the mining, manufacture, and installation, it's a great material.    Maybe just maybe your construction industry is full mobsters.  In big cities, major construction companies are owned by mobsters. Try doing some building maintenance in Montreal, for example. I guarantee you that you will end up hiring a mobster run company regardless whether you want it or not. At some point, integrity of your bones or your personal method of transportation not igniting start to matter. >Assbestosis *Facepalm*. That's the takeaway you got from my comment? Some people just like sticking their head in the dirt like an ostrich to deny reality. Alternative Ontario I think it needed damaging big media reveals to get its act together. Canada, as a government, was perfectly okay with exporting it to the detriment of others while banning it at home. Australia already stopped producing it. Hell, there's a town out in the desert, that used to be an Asbestos mine, that is like a mini-Pripyat. Maybe a more equitable country where everyone has access to safe housing food and health care would be a better option. Assuming they don't degrade (which they do) or become damaged. It is fundamentally flawed for any usage because of those very dangers. If it is ever damaged it causes major problems.  So Remodelling could accidentally disturb it if someone has an accident on the work site, natural disasters such as tornados, earthquakes, etc.. Someone crashing a car into a building. Building demolition (purposeful and nefarious).  There is simply no reason to use a building material that is dangerous when damaged. No building will ever be guaranteed to be damage free. Don't forget removal.  No big deal to just scrape it up without any personal protective equipment, it's just immigrants doing those jobs. Oh and disposal.  Just throw it wherever, no big deal! We are going to be dealing with asbestos for decades going forward.  The last thing we need is to put out more that will require eventual removal and disposal. The biggest PITA is dealing with existing installations decades after install. Yeah it's a bit like uranium. Great stuff if used carefully. Alas when it's not, there's some issues. ? Is that when your sister has the best ass? Im not disagreeing with you lol Or crashing something bigger : http://www.twitlonger.com/show/jm9f46 Like heroin, then. Oh I misunderstood your comment. What were you saying? Someone please save us. All good That they only called it corrupt because it was a democrat doing it. Do we deserve it?

They claimed Obama's expanded drone program as a victory (also an odd claim). Good more targets for Mattis. here's a spin:  Bannon and Trump know fine well the ban will stoke resentment and prejudice and increase the risk of terrorism. That's the whole point. They *want* an ISIS inspired attack on US soil to justify what will be a much larger move against muslims. If a 3 month ban to implement a better vetting process would cause some to radicalize, then maybe it's a good idea to keep them out.   This is the Irony of it all, Jihadi groups and white nationalist have a common goal that is not allow people to live in a mixed society. Once the societies mix and live safely and prosper most ethnic and religious groups lose their biogted relevance. This is fundamentally why Islamic terrorists target multicultural societies and not countries like Russia or China which are much more openly anti-islam.  hmm, doesn't Iran oppose jihadist groups, yet they were still banned? Good thing we have Saudia Arabia on the good books >the new policy validates their claim that the United States is at war with Islam.  Hillarys bombs would have made them so happy also. Its like its lose-lose with these people. When will people learn that just because bad guys like something doesn't make it bad in and of itself?   It's like when people were for some reason warming up to al Qaeda because it bombed ISIS a few times.  For once the White House is *actually* producing mandates that fit their narrative.

That's pretty darn hopeful. Most American Muslims are certainly not happy with Trump, but they are not going to rush to join a jihad. This isn't just jihadists claiming/spinning anything as a victory. This is jihadists claiming a victory on their goal: To erode American values, culture and freedoms. You think some goatherder cares about America or Americans? No he cares about himself. And he sees the US as the Big Bad storm coming to the middle east ""infecting"" it with it's values and liberties. Things that break their social structure down that they've been accustomed to. (This is by NO means defending any of their crappy values) Terrorists can't go toe to toe with our military (that's why they resort to terror attacks). Their whole goal is to instill fear in the public, incite pressure, political change, and erode Western liberties and values. Someone in another thread mentioned these countries ban Isreali passports. What message does it send to the liberal Syrian when we start acting like their own country. What happens when that model of life, liberty, and freedom erodes away. Same thing when your star athlete gets caught juicing/cheating.

Somehow that logic doesn't seem to land with me, people seem so quick to call this a win for terrorists and whatnot (which it is, very, very minorly) but imagine this logic in he west. Would it make sense if a German person became a militaristic, anti-british terrorist just because we didn't let them move over? People seem to have an agenda if they rabidly promote this idea of such low standards for getting people to become terrorists. It almost seems like terrorist sympathisers lining up reasons (regardless of how much they would truly radicalise someone) for why we're the ones hurting the terrorists again and it's all our fault as usual.   Like I said, I can see why others see it as a bad move for relations but saying it's leading to radicalism seems like a logical leap for the sake of it.  In fairness, jihadist groups will spin anything for recruitment. You could hand out free passes to America and they would spin it as the West trying to corrupt the youth, or use it as evidence that Allah has invited them to conquer the West.  Open your borders or we kill and bomb you? Sounds like a terrorist threat to me. Why does it even upset anyone who isn't doing business in US? Is this some reverse psychology bullshit? It's as there was this cookie you never paid a single thought and out of nowhere owner says you can't have it anyway. You'd have to be seriously butthurt if it suddenly started to nag you.   And let's not completely ignore how the current situation are. Apparently Iranians already hate US, they (US) are directly supplying arms to those who bomb in Yemen, they're bombing in Syria, they've invaded Iraq and Afghanistan, they helped overthrow the government in Libya, god knows what they're doing in Somalia and Sudan. Personally I wouldn't want to seek refugee in the country who's partly responsible for my current situation to begin with. [removed] Jihadists must not be very good at chess.  About ten moves in this strategy will fuck them over. But I thought Muslims are peaceful people? I don't see Chinese people turning themselves into terrorist just because a country rejects their refugee application, why is that? Not their ""only"" recruiting strategy. Many future potential suicide bombers/attackers are inspired by successful terrorist activity as well.  They see someone shoot up a mall or drive through a crowd and think, ""I could do that! Where's my 15 minutes of fame and my 72 virgins/olives?"" I think developing strategies to prevent successful attacks will very difficult and that the problem has many causes and will defy quick, short-term solutions. is superficial, unless you plan to cuddle 1 billion muslims you'll never have an end to it...and that is ignoring the entire ideology...  during the cold war the idea was not to cuddled the poor with love but to show the advances of capitalism over socialism...the current crisis is that promoting the advances of secular law over religious law have been deemed Islamophobic and that has allow radicalism to fester and grow into more conservative groups...  expanding Islam over the face of the planet is one of the task of every Muslim, the same way expanding socialism was part of been a socialist/communist.  so the more you think that cuddling people will convince them of the negative effects of their ideology the more deaths, the more suffering and the more we have to enforce security measures.   articles like this is the reason a ""muslim ban"" does not get the condemnation you expected and in fact you have to label any opponent as evil even when they can present factual facts. Not so much to brainwash, most of them have sponges filling the void in their heads.   This is how it goes in insurgent wars. The military forces and the insurgent forces are trying to win over a certain population whether it's the home population or overseas. You're right we should appease whoever it takes so they're not mean to us.  Sounds like winning policy.   So the peace-loving normal and rational Muslims are easily swayed into violence?  Is that what you are saying?  Do you *honestly* think that the US vetting people from Iran (for example) would be the tipping point?  ""Well I was going to go to America to start my engineering education, but now.. NOW I am going to go cut off some heads and blow stuff up!""  That is such a disservice to rational, normal people and it's racist.  But that's par for the course really, no different than saying ""Poor blacks can't find a DMV and don't know how to use the internet, Voter ID is racist I bet they don't even have data on their phones!!"" Please apply the same logic to white Americans, and you will understand why trump got elected and still has so much support. And the sooner they show their true colors the easier it will be to take them out. This ban was a brilliant move by Trump.   [removed] Obama is proof of this. He dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Muslims and radicalised an entire generation.  The hysteria and hypocrisy of Trump's critics make it impossible to take them seriously. ""...said one posting to a pro-Islamic State channel on Telegram, a social-media platform.""  Too funny.  State Ban Islamic, Muslim Trump from what?  I thought their only victory was sex with donkeys  I don't see why, considering most terrorists are homegrown. It's a victory for them because it's vindication. ""See! We just had to push them a little, kill a few of them like their soldiers kill us, and they show their true colours."" It's a deluded viewpoint but it's a powerful one. It will lead to more homegrown terrorists.  Not really an odd claim. The more Americans piss off the middle east, the more people these terrorists can recruit. You should pay attention to news because Russia has been a victim of quite a few terrorist attacks, the only difference is that Russia doesn't give a fuck about human rights, they will literally capture, torture or kill anyone who was involved in it, and they will punish their families too.    > Russia or China which are much more openly anti-islam.  wait a minute..   russia has 17 million of muslims population and china has 21 million.  how do muslims living in those countries agreed to their government which openly anti-their religion?  i'm confused, make me understand. The craziest thing is that jihadist groups and white nationalists in the 80s were on the same team due to mutual hatred of jews. The silent brotherhood tried to recruit muslims here in the US.  Guess the solution is to become openly anti Islam then. Yet its only western society expected to mix  Really made me think I wouldn't put Russia in there. China also had to deal with Islamic extremists, although not as much as the west.  > This is fundamentally why Islamic terrorists target multicultural societies and not countries like Russia or China which are much more openly anti-islam.  ... China is not ""openly anti-Islam."" One of its largest ethnic groups, the Hui are Muslims and have lived in China for hundreds of years.   In addition, what's funny is that both of those nations that you've mentioned have Muslim terror groups and rebellions within their borders. How did you miss the Chechen Wars and the Xinjiang conflict, the latter home to the largest terrorist attacks in Chinese history (the one with all the knife stabbings?)  They target us because we are weak. China and Russia would not have a bunch of ignorant celebrities gushing on stage and massive protests over the right of a foreign people to move there.  Liberal societies have a hard time dealing with people movements, it is generally what results in their demise (either that or violent invasion). Iran financially supports Hezbollah, a terrorist organization, but I agree, Saudi Arabia shouldve been on the ban too. Iran opposes *Sunni* terrorist groups  They're still a terrorist-supporting theocracy tho. Nah, they're just full of shit.   Islamists are like the fat kid who would slap the nes controller out of your hand when  you're winning. Nothing disturbs their bullshit ideology more than you winning and them losing, so theyll always twist it enough to make it sound like they have it all under control.  What makes people think Hillary would of be so quick to go to war?Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't the last three major military wars/occupations take place under the GOP?  That world order died last year. Because the mentally ill left will latch onto anything  to character assassinate people who don't follow the narriative. You're absolutely right.   But it's also important to remember that terrorists main goal is to spread terror. To disrupt, to cause confusion and to divide, to make people fearful. This causes damage to their targets.   Right now they are not having to do a thing and the US is divided, the world is confused and a lot of people are fearful. Mission successful.  You mean the completely different thing that obama did? Like oh i don't know stop new visas from being made for 6 months because an actual terrorist made it into the US and the 6 months was to amke the vetting process better? And by everyone you mean jihadists and Trump supporters. If someone is that swayed by an ideology so easily that they will go out and kill for it then they were already messed up to begin with. Right, because being nice to them has been working out great! Fuck them, if anyone is on the fence and they decide to join the jihadi cause because of a temporary ban then that's fine, we'll kill them too. We have enough bombs to literally level the entire middle east. >West to pause and contemplate the reasons behind the animosity and enmity held by Muslims for Westerners and even take heed and consider  repentance  by  abandoning their  infidelity  and  accepting Islam  It's weird that we don't just pepper them with nerve gas and move on to bigger issues. Yeah ! That'll teach him ! He already has a beautiful wife, you need to be really hot to even be considered.  Which is weird because they are the ones with the drugs. That's not how it works. The idea is that banning muslims from America is contributing to their alienation from the West. Who will they turn to? Who is fighting for them? The corrupt Arab governments and dictatorships? Nope. So maybe some of them start thinking, ""fuck it, might as well join the Caliphate and make Islam great again!"". True, but even threatening to kick people out of their homes and ruin the lives they've tried so hard to build is enough to radicalized some more. Definitely a victory for the jihadists.  Hush. Obama's double tap policy with drones is textbook Nobel Peace Prize winning material. Yeah but we got a contract with USBombmaker Ltd. I doubt the Kurds in Kobani are saying this.  [removed] Trumps doing both. Or the media stirring the pot.   ""Aargh, the U.S. has killed my loved one using a drone strike so I am going to blow myself up at the market of those of a rival religion or sect to get back at them!"" Why are you bringing up Obama? He's no longer President, Trump is.  Any actual sources to all of this or are we just playing psychologist? You know what potentially allows radical groups like ISIS to gain significant footholds in the US? Throwing fuel onto the ""you are not welcome and are unwanted"" fire by having targeted, bigoted, specific action by the highest executive authority in the nation.  I'd love if we would stop giving them valid reasons so we could prove that.  Sure, but ""free tix = corruption"" isn't likely to be as effective as banning people who live in the US 100% legally from returning home just because they've gone to visit relatives abroad, or stopping students with dual citizenship from returning to visit their degrees after vacation (even though they could have spend tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars on a half-education). That is life-destroying shit. The existence of some limitless set of totally ineffective strategies for jihadist recruitment doesn't negate how powerful a tool disaffection is. And it will be given an anti-trump spin and reach the front page of /r/politics in half an hour. Not much I reckon. Probably not much less than gaslighting torture victims. is worse than that is masochism and is been sold by sadist.  Didn't you know that Islam is the only religion with violent holy books. There's a gulf between ""coddling"" and ""religious discrimination."" > But I thought Muslims are peaceful people?  The violent ones aren't, just like with all religions. China has not been constantly bombed and destabilized for the last 30 years. Because, despite typical false American conceptions, China isn't that bad of a place to live. Its living standards have skyrocketed over a generation, its had a slow and steady (if very managed) increase in public participation in the political process and media and hasn't been bombed in a few generations. Qualitatively different scenario. People who have a future (as the Chinese so clearly do) don't often turn to terrorism.   What we do have in China is a large portion of our Muslim population that is seen as friends and equals.   See Hui Muslims. So yes, I would contend that Muslims are peaceful people.  Well Tibet has created terrorists over their independence am a muslim, I dont want to kill anyone No, you're right, I was being slightly hyberbolic. The 'copycat' effect definitely exists. ISIS is in a weird way a meme (in the sense of a self-propagating unit of culture). They can do things, inspire copycats, and then claim them after the fact.  That said, in the places where they are actually trying to form a state (the levant) the majority of their recruitment is likely from disaffected muslims. This hasn't been as successful in the developed world because of the (relative) opportunities afforded here. If that is allowed to change, then we can expect that tactic to begin to work here as well.  You sound like the religious believer here.  A lot of faith in those ""truths"".  No, this is as wrong as it gets.  They don't need to be cuddled.  They need to be left the fuck alone to deal with their own issues.  Which means stop manipulating their leaders, overthrowing governments, and waging endless war.  Doing this in the Cold War and earlier is what got us here and created widespread Islamic Fundamentalism.  We should let these nations fight their wars just as Western nations did to come to the relatively stable borders of today.  Let them kill each other enough until they look for other solutions instead of giving them a 3rd party they can blame their problems on.   Yeah. By that logic we should appease Trump voters in all ways and never say mean things about them, or else they vote for populists. Trump supporters have agency, though. These people do not. He is creating terrorists from productive members of society, trump is a buffoon.  Solid counter-argument, you've convinced me. >drivel  FTFY Just like Bush did for almost 8 years before. Yes, we can thank the establishment for that. But now Trump is starting to turn the power of the state inward onto the legal residents of his own country. If you can't take real actions of the most powerful man in the world seriously because other leaders before have done terrible things too then you're wilfully ignorant. I guess that's just the times though, people want to be ignorant.  Is there any quantitative research really showing that? From what I have seen since the 70s the Middle East was *always* pissed at the US. And it has not much to do with immigration or drones or whatever, it's simply because the US is Israel's big brother. Yeah but think about the end game of infinite escalation with the US. Once everyone is dead, who do you recruit? So has China, so has India but here is what I want to say about Muslim extremist groups in chechnya, kashmir and in Uighur.   All these societies had social discontent, like most societies. So what the government did, instead of addressing them or giving it voice, indigenous leaders who wanted attention on civil issues were jailed or killed, foreign trained muslim extremist quickly took control of the social discontent and made it a religious war.  These foreign trained islamic groups are predominantly funded by Saudi who are sitting behind american protection and sowing all kinds of hate, but they are not checked and most of their charities are still open and used to churn out religious fundamentalists. Yeah, it sure has helped.  Russia and China dont have a free press that shows the problems they persecute anyone who talks about it. China Expelled a french reporter for writing about Muslim persecution in china. Russia until a few years did not allow any new mosques in moscow, it was only after there was a backlash in the muslim world that Putin stepped in and allowed it and now putin paints it like it was his idea from the very beginning. China, muslims are not allowed to not sell products for religious reasons. There were even regulations on beard, burkha and veil. Muslim children should not be forced to go to the mosque.  there are bunch of terrorists from in these restive Muslims regions/states many run away, some get radicalized and become terrorists, and attack other countries. for example turkish night club shooter was Uighur, ISIS commander is from Chechnya, many fighters in afghanistan were from Chechnya.   Both these countries can navigate this curtailing of religious liberties  because they fully control the press and mass media, So they can blanket ban any references to poor treatment of Muslims. Im not sure in Russia's Case, but in China's case they are sorta anti Religion.  I've heard some white nationalists say that they don't actually have anything again other races, they just believe that each race should stay in its own country and remain separate from others for maximal racial unity, and that instead of fighting each other, the ultimate aim of national socialism is to unite all races, all peoples, against the jew.  ...Still doesn't make any sense, but... That's a given. Not really.   You probably just don't realise that other societies mix as well because they look the ""same skin tone"" to you.   Let's take a look at China. How about India? How about Indonesia?  Just to name a few. The East Asian nations are actually quite homogeneous ethnically. The Southeast Asian and South Asian nations? Not really.  Nope there are multi cultural societies much older than the west eg; have a look at India extremely multi cultural, there is almost every race, religion present in india. multiculturalism is new to the west, India has be practicing it for centuries, every persecuted group would have a outpost in India.  Here is the thing, Middle east was multicultural too, a few incidents in history changed it and it changed more acutely after the creation of Israel. Arabs were so angry at creation of Israel that they have let hate breed in their societies and as a consequence that hate first targeted other religions then other sects inside islam and now it is targeting all arabs muslims themselves.   The saudis in arabia propped up dictators of the west, finance most islamic fundamentalism, Pakistan another ally of the west, arms and trains a lot of terrorists, now turkey after erdogan has started sticking its beak into the Islamic fundamentalist cauldron.   Unless the west breaks away from these countries, there will be no change to the war on terror. What america is doing is putting bandages to a fever infection, just the wrong treatment for a misdiagnosed problem. > Yet its only western society expected to mix > Really made me think  Western society expects that of itself. Jihadi groups target rival sects much more than the U.S. or Europe. > it is generally what results in their demise (either that or violent invasion).  Where are you getting this?  Also, what kind of government are you suggesting in place? If SA was on the list, I'm pretty sure they wouldn't have agreed so easily to establishing safe zones in the area.  It's not ideal but putting SA on the list would have accomplished little compared to getting their cooperation in finding an alternative solution to the refugee influx.    It's all about being pragmatic and weighing your options, instead of idealistically charging forward based on feelings. Excuse my ignorance but wouldn't the rest of the world have a problem with them funding terrorist groups, you say it so casually like oh yeah this developed nation is funding the loss of innocent lives and so is Saudi, like isn't the US trying to wipe out terrorists, meanwhile we got countries funding their progress? Please explain why the U.S doesn't just say stop that shit or we'll bomb you too It's all politics. Iran was also the first to send ground troops to fight ISIS near its borders but that's not important. What's important is Obama fixing a deal with them which we should be against because Trump said so. one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter  George Galloway Iran is supporting Hezbollah to survive in the region not to push their religious agenda.  Most Islamists are Sunnis lol we wanted you to ban us, it was our plan all along! Meh I grudgingly prefer Hillary over Trump but it seems likely she'd continue with Obama's drone strikes. > mentally ill left > defund_pph  k And the right doesn't? Wake up The US isn't divided. It's a small fraction of the population that are being fueled by media that are causing issues.  People forget that more than 60% of the voters have no party affiliations. And cities are democrat hives so they protest there almost every day anyway.   This has been how it's always been. Hardly attributed to ISIS subterfuge.  >And by everyone you mean jihadists and Trump supporters.  They are pretty much on the same level of ""intelligence"".    If keeping these folks out is enough to turn them into suicide bombers, maybe keeping them out is a good idea.   *Hey let me in your house*  ""No.""  *Let me in or I'll stab your family*  ""Better let him in.""   > We have enough bombs to literally level the entire middle east.  Is that what you want to do? Funny how that includes Israel, but I guess killing Jews would be another plus to you types.  Yes, I just called you a Nazi, unironically and literally (the old meaning) because that is what you are. Disgusting piece of shit. did i say anything about being nice to them? i was more saying don't be a total and utter cunt to them.  let's put it this way, you know how many fatal terrorist attacks in the US have come from the particular banned countries in the last 37 years? none. most of the terrorist attacks after 9/11 (whose perpetrators came from saudi arabia, lebanon, egypt and i think pakistan feel free to correct me on that last one- none of which are banned nations)? american citizens radicalized in either america, or one of the muslim nations not banned.  not to mention, that's a cold and callous way of looking at the situation, have you no empathy for your fellow man?   radicalization is going to happen no matter what, of course it will, but don't you think it'd be better to minimize radicalization, and minimize casualties both abroad and at home? instead of leveling entire nations?  you do realize you're advocating for the inquisition of warhammer 40k, except in real life right? you're literally advocating [Exterminatus](http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/Exterminatus)- purge the heretic, collateral be damned.  you freely give away your liberty in exchange for safety, and for that? you deserve neither. You should do this wild thing called trying to understand them first. This is a symptom of US imperialism. We are solely to blame for the radicalization and we are exacerbating it with this presidency. The only place in need of nerve gas is the white house Beauty is subjective. She's an escort who likes shitty gameshow hosts. [removed] Alienation? We accept them, they are allowed to migrate to almost anywhere in the world and Europe for example has stood up for them regardless of recent events with terrorism, we saw through the terrorist tactics and promoted unity over fear regardless of the bloodshed. The alienation from America alone is still a temporary ban for only some regions so doesn't even specifically target muslims alone. Are Turkey, Saudi Arabia, pakistan etc. that are not on the list no longer muslim?   Again, logic I can't agree with. A temporary ban from the good guys (if you're framing it as islamist death cults and dictators vs the humble west) means you'll excuse the thinking of joining a murderous cult that slaughters innocent people? I hope china doesn't reject my application for moving or I'm going on the biggest rampage across Asia you can imagine! Your first sentence works really well as a reply to your comment.  >The idea is that banning muslims from America is contributing to their alienation from the West  They sound pretty entitled.   >Nope. So maybe some of them start thinking, ""fuck it, might as well join the Caliphate and make Islam great again!"".  The denser the target, the better. Doesn't allowing in refugees, which Isis said that they would infiltrate, also count as a victory for jihadists?  Eh the people with green cards who are frequently travelling in and out of our country are probably people with at least middle class means and some university education. They're very unlikely to be radicalized under any circumstances because they're already pretty westernized. Trumps just being a huge dick head to them How does not allowing ENTRY threaten someone already *legally* here?  Serious.  Their parents should remind them then. Bringing up history from the Middle Ages doesn't help the Christian side one bit While I agree that's correct, it's extremely heartless and shows a deep flaw in our society. No one brought up bush when obama was in office.    No one. There are no valid reasons for justifying jihadist ideologies.  >banning people who live in the US 100% legally from returning home  Source? I read that those with green cards & US citizens are unaffected by the 90-day travel ban [removed] Critical thinking and knowledge are severely lacking on this site. >They need to be left the fuck alone to deal with their own issues.  then why they are migrating into Europe? why the terror attacks outside their own countries?  >created widespread Islamic Fundamentalism  dude, by the time the British meet with Faisal during WW1 they already had the same reactions to the presence of unbelievers in their territories after that if you look closely is always a dictator from a minority having to oppress the majority of the population,2/3 of the dictators in the middle east were on the soviet side of the cold war, not to mention that almost 500 years ago the current  form of Islamic fundamentalism came to be by declaring any knowledge outside of the Quran as heresy...how do you think they when from the most advance civilization in the world to one of the most backward today...  > Let them kill each other enough  so the rest can ask for asylum in Germany? no longer an option, they have no interest in their own countries and the fundamentalist have new targets forcing europe into obedience. Yes, I think the opinion of citizen voters who elected Trump should weigh more than that of those who aren't citizens and want to harm this country and its' people. Maybe they do. Maybe they don't.  The point is, they felt like they don't, and voted accordingly.  This is largely fueled by a massive economic downturn, drug problems, and poverty in predominantly white areas, coupled with the left rabidly telling white men how nice they have it while simultaneously denying and deflecting the above problems.  There's only so many times people can be lectured about ""cis privilege"" while you're worrying how to feed your kids, before you decide to take a chance on a wildcard.   If someone becomes a terrorist because the U.S. issued a 90 day travel ban from seven specific countries while updating their visa program then this person was unstable in the first place. If a 90 day visa ban converts you into a terrorist, I'm just glad they aren't in the country yet. Productive members of society don't respond to travel bans by strapping on suicide vests.   The politics of the left are absolutely toxic and pernicious. Majority of them don't even know what the executive order entails. Like the hysterical fuckwits they are, the regressive left are just going on the opinion of others without understanding the source material.  I'm honestly not sure, but I am sure there's *definitely* no research showing our constant drone strikes *don't* increase recruitment, and yet people just accept that as fact (as the voting on these comments show)  I definitely support certain targeted strikes, but when you look at how many non-combatants we kill with drones, I feel like it's common sense that it's pissing some people off......  You're certainly right that us constantly helping Israel (be it financial aid, strategic aid, giving them cover in the UN, etc...) will always give them something to be mad about (considering I don't see that changing any time soon) No, but it sure seems like common sense. You're not wrong about our relationships having something to do with it though.  Think about it: ""Hey, the US is being a total dick to us right now! You're stuck in this shithole, you cant go there because they hate you! Why not fight back with us, ISIS/Al Queda/etc.!""  Seems like effective propaganda to me. As I've said before, I'm not a fan of Saudi Arabia, that's the motherload of extremism. Except that any religion can register with the Chinese government in order to be allowed to be practised in China.   Additionally, the Hui Muslims have lived in China for hundreds of years with little problem. You can be a Muslim in China and be perfectly happy. 9 out of the 10 Muslim minorities in China do so every day.  While im not disagreeing that hate got a million times worse because of israel, shit has always been bad because of islam. In every single one of those instances there was always discrimination.  Especially in India. The English didn't partition it for a laugh, they did it to try and stem the Muslim - Hindu violence. The anthropologist J.D Unwin studied the trend, you can read all the examples here: https://archive.org/details/b20442580   The man was a liberal thinker too - so you can't criticise him for being biased, he ends the book hoping we find a way to balance this but so far there is no example in human history of this being achieved.   I think it is you who needs to read up on world history, instead of being stuck in the last 80 years.  China will dominate us. We are far too weak to maintain order in the world. China doesn't bother people about human rights. A military junta would be neat. I'd settle for Bannon. SA is the number one sponsor of terror around the world, but hey, oil and money... Its not as easy as ""Stop or we'll bomb you"".  Iran is a developed nation with a somewhat formidable military.  Fighting Hezbollah is easier. Its kinda like the various wars that Israel fought with Syria, Jordan and Egypt.  It was a way for the US and USSR to fight each other without fighting each other (Israel used US equipment and the others used Soviet equipment). Said the British Communist and America's hater.   Right, not push their religious agenda, just destroy Israel, no biggy. And? Iran supports islamists who are not Sunnis, so it is wrong to say they 'help fight terrorism', as if they do so on the basis of a moral stance against Islamic terrorism in general The Houtis... I see youre just  chock full of logical fallacies and finger pointing. Higher than a liberal's, yes. Jihadists are at least smart enough to use liberal white woman as useful idiots. You might have replied to the wrong comment. No, just saying I don't care how many get radicalized by a temporary immigration ban, we'll just add them up to the drone list. Name calling is nothing new coming from leftist liberals. Keep doing it if it makes you happy. Yeah because communists never purged anyone either.. you are one to talk. You know why there hasn't been any terrorist attacks from countries banned in the last 37 years? Because the bans worked. Now if we could only ban a few more of those countries such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan.   Every country has a right to decide who they want to let in. >You should do this wild thing called trying to understand them first  I do. Their continued existence still makes us look weak.  >This is a symptom of US imperialism. We are solely to blame for the radicalization and we are exacerbating it with this presidency  Fair enough, now I still fully embrace US imperialism and its consequences.  Beauty is as objective as mathematics, because beauty is defined by proportions, and proportions is defined by ratios, and ratios are pure mathematical forms.   Why are you objectifying women, because they're not part of your political idealogy?  Except its exactly how it works, and how it works when pretty much any radical populist regime comes to power through a popular movement. You have a population that feels threatened, the elites don't care and nobody is taking their side, except some fringe lunatics who promise to restore their greatness. A combination of desperation, anger and fear, basically. Pretty sure they would claim victory no matter what. I mean, it just makes sense to claim victory whenever anything major happens that isn't an obvious win/loss.  Only if you allow thousands of refugees to cross the border unchecked like in Europe. But this is not what the US does, they pick and vet refugees, often entire families, directly from the refugee camps. The threat of significant ISIS infiltration is minimal to almost nonexistant. Anything is a victory for Jihadists. That battle they lost where two westerners died yet 200 extremists were killed? That's 2 infidels gone and 200 martyrs. A victory. Nope. That's a major blow against them, because the refugees get deradicalized and starting telling ISIS to fuck off. Jihadist want to do as much damage and hurt as possible. Till now the people they have hurt the most are the refugees. By keeping these people out and giving them no safe space to live or build a life the jihadis are doing way more harm then a terror attack could. Hate against refugees is a victory for the jihadist. Refusing refugees, because you think they are terrorists is a victory for the jihadists. Nearly every terrorist attack in the US (islamic or right-wing) has been committed by middle class people. It's the educated that are the easiest to convince actually.  Trump's executive order was originally being applied to all people from the countries on the list, whether or not they had green cards or visas (meaning they were already legally here). Some of these people happened to be out of the country when Trump signed his order and were subsequently not being allowed to return.  Believe it or not people like to go visit their relatives. I love how conservatives have so dehumanized muslims to the point where obvious human things stop being obvious. Re-entry after going to visit relatives abroad? Surely a half a second of thought isnt too big of an ask... Obama got a Nobel Peace Prize essentially for being elected president while being black. He hadn't done anything by that point. His conduct with regards to drone attacks is reprehensible to my thinking, and his failure to close Guantanamo Bay as well.   However, nothing bad Obama did is ever going to hold a candle to what Trump will end up doing, he's only been in office a week and already caused a major shitstorm both at home and internationally.  So if someone crucifies him for it, he's earning it :P And? What does that have to do with Trump? Nobel Peace Price? Why are you angry over what a Norwegian institution thinks? Since the above article was posted, the part of the blanket ban that had prevented green card holders from returning home has been lifted (which is what this article linked below is discussing). A good choice to remove this restriction, it was almost certainly going to be found illegal anyway.  http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-30/us-tempers-part-of-trump-travel-ban-amid-big-protests/8224352 I don't really like watching snuff films so the last time I saw anyone holding a severed head was probably like 5+ years ago. Some Mexican cartels doing fucked up shit on r/watchpeopledie  Well, as a non-American, I totally agree. A nation state exists to selfishly benefit its own citizens.  That's just how things are and will always be, and there's nothing wrong with that. I was being sarcastic.  As if Jihadists aren't human, but merely some permanent symptom of white people's will... And now white people must contort the poor brainless and amoral Muslim savages into not supporting the Islamic supremacists. God forbid that they address the Muslims as equal human beings to themselves, with equal rights and responsibilities, like for the ideologies they support as Muslims or how they react to outside attacks or tragedy... Of course the respective Muslims are just as responsible for supporting Jihadists as the respective ""white people"" are for supporting Trump, either that or none of them are. Everybody has agency. [This is not reality](http://www.counter-currents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/whitemansburdencrop3.jpg); Muslims are free to think rationally and connect certain undesirable events in their lives to some underlying causes that may or may not come from an external source, just as they're free and responsible for their own beliefs and attitudes, and the societies they create. Supporting the cause for another country's reactionary treatment of Muslims at its borders just because you feel indignant is idiotic.   And anybody who wants to be on such a high moral and intellectual horse that they take responsibility even for the Muslims' condition as a civilization in general -- of the Muslim individual's mind and autonomy itself -- then surely they can absorb some blame for president Trump and his voter's thoughts and choices as well.   Isolating an entire faith is bound to create enemies, it is only going to add fuel to the isis fire. You can't keep up with this us vs. them attitude, we are all in this together.    It's sending a message in America that middle eastern people do no deserve rights. It's far more than a 3 month ban.  Not a single trump supporter or Trump administration member gas said what's wrong with the current visa program or been able to mention a single American killed by a terrorist holding a visa. It's a Muslim ban because you are afraid of brown people  http://heavy.com/news/2017/01/barack-obama-ban-refugees-did-iraq-iraqi-muslim-trump-jimmy-carter-iran-iranian-immigration/ Trump only cares about his wallet and his business interests, stop pretending he has any idea how to run a country. No, but by isolating Muslim communities you will increase the chances that the influence of Isis will spread and grow.  What we do know is that the vast majority of the victims of terrorist groups aren't U.S. citizens or say drone manufacturing employees but local people from different religions or sects.  It's like, ""Oh man I'm so pissed at drones I'm going to blow myself up at the market!""  ""Drones make me so made I'm going to kidnap a bunch of Yardizi women and traffic them!""     This is exactly what binds left and right wing, but the two sides are so ideologically driven that they cant agree on this. Again this is how politicians control the populace, most Americans are not against islam but they have so much ideological bias that they cant agree on things they are fundamentally in agreement with. No, the English didn't partition it because they're wonderful people, they did it because divide and conquer. Nice bait. I don't disagree.  But adding them to the list would have been purely symbolic without accomplishing much.    Their 'alliance' and their potential addition to the list can be used in a much more useful manner.  Case in point: the safe zones negotiation.       I'm glad that Trump is a pragmatist instead of giving in to emotional and symbolic bullshit that normal politicians are burdened with. Well isn't hezbollah committing terrorist acts on civillians and if so isn't the US and the rest of the world against that? And the US military is far greater so they would succumb to their requests unless they want to lose a war. Trump wants to fight ISIS yes? Iran is fighting ISIS. A common enemy, maybe forge stronger ties? You can bash ""libtards"" as much as you want.  From european point of view your ""libtards"" and ""dumbcons"" are pretty much the same.   Both wouldn't find europe on a map, have the attention span of a gold fish and can be distrected by a ball of fur coated in sugar.  I thought Trump supporters were against the drone campaigns. I'm  just stating facts. [Whataboutism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism), another frequently misused term, perfectly correct to describe your comment.     what bans? as far as i'm aware, those bans which ""worked"" were only enforced as of a couple days ago because the coward in charge of america shit his breeches over potential terrorism that hasn't happened yet.   What? I live in Dearborn ,Mi. We have over 30 percent Muslims. They are from all the countries listed and more. No sharia law. No special problems. They say they are Americans. They think like one and act like one. [removed] Welp. A foreign country doesn't support us anymore. Let's join a group that I hate.   Yeah, that's how it works, thanks.  Until ISIS becomes better at acting. [That is false and suicidally naive to believe. Here's 20 who passed the vetting process.](http://www.informationliberation.com/?id=56194)   You cannot vet these people. What governments can you affirm claims with? What paperwork can you trust? What makes you think only the ones with traditional western values will get in?  You're naive to think that's actually how efficient the vetting process is. If we did our due diligence, it would take a year to let a family in here.  Also, we're not sending people back to their countries. We're just not allowing more to come. You're getting it. Islam is not compatible with our society. They will attack us either way. So do we lock the door, or open it and pray for good intentions? Not true. Radicalizations are more common among second generation immigrants. It's time to put social justice aside and realize that there is no room for coexistence within the teachings of Islam. If you do not believe this, don't take anyone's word for it, and read the Koran yourself. And allowing in people who believe in Sharia law and hate the way our society works because of virtue signalling is stupid.  There are plenty of countries in the Middle East they can go to. There are a shit load of peaceful nations between the US and the Middle East that share their culture and religion.  Only when you're actually right. I thought it was only *immigrants*  Someone with a greencard or citizenship should be unaffected.  The important take away is that they *tried* to get the blanket ban through initially.  Either through malice or just complete lack of knowledge of the process.  I'm guessing the latter. While I'm not disagreeing, can you point me to a source for the claim that the initial order explicitly banned green card holders & US citizens from entry? As I understood it it only mentioned those who sought to newly immigrate or travel to the US in the next 90 days, and this was interpreted extremely as applying to green card holders, which the trump-administration spokespeople mentioned in that article seem to be saying was an incorrect interpretation don't play dumb, those aren't religiously motivated attacks. the quran is uniquely horrible in its prescription of violence. this islam apologism is one of the reasons people felt cornered into voting for trump  You're an idiot, we are talking religion, not drug cartels.  The ban doesn't mention religion. There is about fifty majoritarily Muslim countries in the world, only seven of them are included in this ban. These countries were selected by the Obama administration. The whole thing is  a standard national security procedure being completely blown out of proportions. He didn't isolate an entire faith, he only banned temporarily citizens from 7 countries, there are literally a shit ton of countries with large Muslim populations and they're still allowed to travel here.   The only people who are fanning the flames of hatred are the white liberals wrongly referring to this policy as a 'Muslim ban'. They and the MSM are doing more harm than anyone. If ISIS is the most influential thing they have, they need to be isolated. You're both partially right, the reason they did it had more to do with wonderful curries though. Muslims and Hindu's got on well before the Brits showed up?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_violence_in_India   Oh. Saudi Arabia is not at our stage. He makes it clear that countries like that are not at our stage yet, so mentioning them has absolutely no relevance. He views liberalisation (and consequently sexual liberation) as a natural consequence of societal evolution (it has happened in nearly every case if a civilisation makes it to that stage of development), but he also points to that as the reason why we will either break up or be conquered by a more patriarchal society. You can see this today, diverse western cultures and traditions are gradually being diluted and forgotten, only practiced by small numbers of people - whereas in less developed nations they are being sustained by large numbers of the population.  Sexual liberation is one side of the same coin, they go hand in hand. You can quite clearly see from the last 60 years it comes about because of liberal policies.  Liberalism is not the foundation of our society. How can you even think that? Do you even understand your own history never mind other civilisations? We are technologically more advanced, but nothing else has changed - our societies were founded like any other. White US citizens are Europeans, when they left Europe to settle America liberal ideas were not on the agenda, even for the foundation of the US as an independent country this was not on the agenda unless you are fond of cherry picking quotes. The founding fathers only envisioned their ideas for white Europeans.  My agenda is to try and protect what we have collectively built up, it seems the 'in thing' to do these days is to offer it out to everyone and anyone even though history shows that this will not end well. I'm half serious there. Trump has been doing exactly what he was saying during his campaign, which is shocking even to me because I thought he was bullshitting like most politicians do during the campaign.  This is a temporary ban until they reexamine how they let people in, he's already said he's gonna lift the ban once they have a more secure vetting system in place. And judging by recent events, now I believe what he says.  What putting Iran on the list accomplished? except for everyone ganging up more locally against Trump? At this point everyone knows this was not for terrorism but just showing the finger to Iran, judging by the reactions of politicians all over the world that too got backfired on Trump. The US Supports terrorists too.   Kurds bomb civilians in turkey, yet they've received US support over and over again.  Those moderate rebels groups the US supports are full of jihadists.  The US actively sells weapons to Saudi Arabia, the biggest funder of wahhabism and subsequently terrorism, in the world. Go to the donald if you want to trigger people, but youll get banned Nope, you're confusing us with Bernie supporters. wow you're a maoist and support Chairman Mao's genocidal policies.  I'm just stating facts~ Right.. that clearly went right over your head. Coward huh, OK then. The family of the San Bernardino shooter are also nice people, and the family of the Orlando shooter were nice too. I can go on forever how many nice muslim families there are out there, but whose childrens have killed scores of Americans. I'm literally shaking This is you right now: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMLHh8KvxVE LOL do you think the process of being vetted is just giving a good performance? Come on, guy. Do you have a source that isn't your blog? So out of the hundreds of thousands of refugees that the US has accepted in the last decade, 20 turned out to be terrorists or sympathizers, and all of them were arrested before being able to commit any terrorist acts.   How many immigrants from other non-muslim countries turn out to be murderers, rapists or violent criminals? I suspect the percentage is higher. Then why not ban all immigration to the US?  > Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.  -- Benjamin Franklin How can our vetting system be improved? Please be specific. You are the one who sounds nave my friend:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U-t3GetV_Q   It's unbelievably hard to make it in as a refugee. The vetting process is incredibly in depth and difficult. The government isn't gonna mess around with something like this. Takes 18-24 months once you've been referred. Most rigorous vetting available. It actually does take close to a year... Soooo...  Edit: I guess it's longer. 18-24 months is pretty standard. Muslims are actually much better at coexisting with us than white conservatives. ... and you are downvoted for criticizing sharia. What's wrong with system prescribing death penalty for apostasy.  Greencard holders are immigrants. Why would a citizen have a greencard? Sure its perspective - the perspective of a small-s Socialist. We are already seeing Racism run rampant in a nation that already had a serious problem with Racism. Now it has the government seal of approval. Now its being implemented with religious discrimination.  If you just let thing slide waiting for something more serious to happen, its only going to get worse. Trump is small-f Fascist in my opinion, some of his followers less so. He's backed by the Extremist Christian polity that want to make radical changes in the name of making the US a Christian state. You can't ignore that either.  People may be upset and marching in the streets but its with good cause. A lot of highly dangerous people with little or no government experience and radical viewpoints are now the *government* and they are going to run rampant.  I liked Obama, at least initially, but he failed to enact the changes he promised, and he failed to enact the transparency he promised when elected. I think he made some good changes despite being opposed by the Republican at every single turn. Trump isn't going to face that obstruction in the same way, because the Republicans control the Senate and the House, and even if some of them don't like him, they are more interested in power and control than they are in doing the right thing.  Should Obama voters have brought up Bush tactics every time they did something controversial in Libya and Syria? Do you think you would have accepted that?  How about no one use anyone else as a scapegoat and we look at the actions for what they are? So we're back to the original topic: Trump fucked up and made it worse. Could well be, and thank goodness they've back peddled on it. Sad thing is they probably could have gotten away with it if it wasn't for the immediate start of the order. Trapping people in the airports was what set everyone against it. Pretty hard not to come across as fascistic when you're detaining law-abiding people.  I bet you've never seen a Quran in your life. Trump has said he will allow Christian refugees from those countries where he has banned imigration. Don't kid yourself, the ban is to limit middle eastern muslims from entering the US.  Saying that it isn't based on religion when trump just said he wants to prioritize christians in the middle east is naive at best. Doesn't help that the implementation is so poorly done Can you tell me where a blanket ban is the same as changing of preferred visa status. You just don't get it, or are you a troll? Sure, because you're probably a fascist.  You guys love to make those anon# accounts. I'm not entirely sure why Iran was included, especially this early.  But you have to remember that this was a list made by Obama (Trump added Syria).  So maybe he didn't want to simply remove a country which would no longer give him the ""Obama's List"" cover and entail questions about why A was removed but not B.      Regardless, Iran is not exactly an 'ally' who can be diplomatically 'encouraged' to cooperate the same way SA can be.  They are openly defiant of the US.      There are plenty of logical and rational explanations why Trump is doing what he is doing, once you don't immediately assume that he's insane, then try to reason from there. It is pretty obvious for everyone with half a brain that in fact my comment went miles over *your* head. You have no idea what you're talking about, so you resort to some dumb ""communits evil *hurr durr*"" talking point in a discussion that has nothing whatsoever to do with communism. Which is exactly what is called ""Whataboutism"", ironically a discussion tactic used by the *actual* commies when accused of human rigts violations. yes coward. that's what he is.  where's his tax returns? obama showed his birth certificate when asked (whether you think it's real or not is frankly irrelevant at this point, he still showed _something_)   why's he closing the borders to certain nations? he's scared that mohammed abdul is gonna creep in through his window and burn his face off.   he vilifies the media, and anyone who disagrees with him politically on twitter gets a volley of personal abuse- those are not the actions of a brave man, a brave man takes disagreement and scruitiny as a public figure on the chin- after all, it's part of the package. all of his actions so far are motivated by greed and fear. > Name calling is nothing new coming from leftist liberals.     None of which came here from one of the banned countries. They were all born here. That makes them Americans. Americans just as crazy as that ones who killed in  Sandy Hook  and Columbine. >[**La,la,la..i can't hear you !

How would you vet someone? How would you verify their documents? It's not like a country that's been ravaged by wars would have great clerical records.  How do you know which is legit and which is a forgery? I mean if they took over government buildings they could make their own paperowrk.  Do you think terrorists are amateurs?  Source? I've heard this somewhere before too. The blog sources Breibart. You don't trust the official news outlet of the us? two got in during obama's term. http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/al-qaeda-kentucky-us-dozens-terrorists-country-refugees/story?id=20931131 Yeah, you will say so until your relatives are hurt. We aren't giving up anything though, we are just selfish which im fine with. I like me. You're naive. Ask me a question that ascertains whether or not I want to kill you. If you're wrong, I kill you, a friend, a family member, a countryman. Would you take that risk? What proof can they give you that's verifiable? Can't quite call up Assad, and a lot of the migrants are even lying about where they're coming from.  Christianity was the prevailing culture in the start of this society. While Christianity teaches to love your neighbour, Islam teaches to kill or convert. Incompatible. Why do Muslims only pop out of the woodwork when Islam is criticized or how to run our system? There's never any respect for our country. Our people. Our way of life and our rule of law. A high percentage want sharia law and advocate terror. There's no muslim admitting that these influxes completely damage a nation, and whenever there's a fucking terrorist attack it's always ""islamaphobia is the real danger!""  No. Islam, very much so a political view, does not work with equal rights among sexuality and genders that our society values. It is not accepting, it is not peaceful. I have read the Koran, I know what it says about infidels.   Your ideology looks bad because every country that's ran by that ideology is a violent shit hole. It looks bad because we're used to religious figures like Jesus in western culture, not a pedophile warlord.  Considering all of the riots, assaults and kidnappings were committed by radical leftists, I'd say no.   Give it up man. Your blind faith to a side is blinding you from the fact that conservatives are your everyday Americans too. Look at the other arguments, shutting them down just shows you're scared of their reasons. It's stupid man. You shouldn't be afraid to be ""islamaphobic"" because being islamaphobic means standing up for the racial, sexual and gender equality we've worked towards as a society. More people need to stick to their own virtues that they signal ""Someone with a greencard or citizenship""  Those are two separate things. i'm syrian and have seen more than i would care for Once the ban is lifted, he will prioritize persecuted minorities, which includes the Christians. The ban itself concerns everyone, regardless of religion. Read the text for Pete's sake. You are talking about the future veting process, this article is about the ban. Hmm, another person who listened to what the news TOLD him about the EO instead of reading it themselves.  You're referring to a section which takes place AFTER the ban, in what will be our new vetting process.   Please learn to do your own research because youre getting orwelled hard... :/ [removed] It's called taking the piss if you can't see that then you really are a dullard, calling someone a Nazi just because they don't share your views is going to attract that sort of reply. As Obama once said, ""elections have consequences""  Pick a better candidate next time. They were americans but their families were foreigners. Had we not let their families to move here, those American casualties would be alive today.   That's why I think the ban didn't go far enough, I would've added a lot more countries on the ban until we put a strict vetting system in place.  Please don't make me cry And how did The administration respond? well, the intelligence agencies found them. the vetting process was strengthened, and during this time, There was a 6 month ban on new visa applicants from iraq. And literally none have come in the last 7 years, so the obama response worked.  Trumps actions are orders of magnitude more severe, but without provocation. He showed to the world that the US is afraid of refugees. He gave ISIS what they wanted, recruitment fuel in a time where they have been struggling. And yet Dylan Roof a white supremacist alt right fanatic has killed more people than all those people combined. Do we can all white people now?  Ok, so the US should stop all immigration immediately in that case. Many legal migrants become murderers, rapists and violent criminals, many also end up in fatal car accidents that kill and maim Americans, in total they cause more harm than all terrorists combined. We can't take the risk of anyone entering the borders of the United States. weve been letting in refugees from various wars for decades, and have been taking from Syria as well - where are all these terrorists attacks? Why aren't they killing Americans? Oh wait, we mainly take women and children after a 2 year vetting process, that it is so practically so fault proof you'd have to be mentally challenged to think it could fail, let alone at a rate high enough to justify turning away thousands for 1 potential person. And considering turning them away breeds even more terrorists, better to let them in on the teeny tiny chance they radicalize themselves here. Because people who are already terrorists sure as fuck ain't makin it through the 2 year process, if they even ever managed to be recommended (they wouldn't). And what terrorist would actually wait that time? Use your brain dude. It's a multi leveled system that is practically bulletproof. You'd have to be a absolute pussy to ever be afraid of refugees. A heartless pussy as that    But I see you chose to believe what you want, rather than let those pesky facts in your way. You have 0 proof of the claim that they lie and get into america. They murdered five innocent people yesterday. It's funny, you know.  If you talk to people on the far left, the ones who say that all white men (by definition) are racist and that all Western nations are founded on white supremacy and all that, and you use the exact same argument (that white men should be treated better to prevent them radicalising and becoming extremist whites), they don't accept that argument. They say that, instead, white men must change, must embrace feminism, must curb their own horrible tendencies by force.  Yet Islam is incapable of this. Muslims must be treated like children, given encouragement and pats on the head, their temper tantrums ignored, because these backwards savages just aren't capable of being held to the same standards as everyone else, the ""grown up"" races and religions.  Which is super shitty when you think about it. Yes, very much implied in my question. You said it only affects immigrants and that greencard holders would be unaffected. Greencard holders are immigrants dummy. I'm glad they've cleared up that they mean only non-greencard-holding-immigrants, but your comment made no sense.  Trump has said on many occasions he wants a total ban on Muslims, what he has signed is the only legal way for him to do that. Just because he doesn't called it that any more, doesn't mean that's not what it is. Here is one of this rallies where he says he wants total ban on Muslims https://youtu.be/-sz0KY-3PbQ Use some critical thinking holy shit Oh i forgot the average donald user thinks that because they read it that no one else did and it changes what it is. [removed] No, bullshit that shows you don't understand the words you are using and haven't even read the comments you are replying to is not called ""taking the piss"", it's called ""being an idiot loser"".  I called someone a Nazi because they were advocating indiscriminate mass-murder. You, on the other hand were insulting me (in a rather stupid way) exactly for not sharing your views.   There should be no ban. The vetting process is very strong. Trump is making shit up and low info people are buying it. It takes over a year and a half to get through. http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/how-does-the-refugee-vetting-process-work/ Was Breitbart found to lie and misrepresent like the MSM? Could you give a source if that's so. Woah get now, you get out of here with your calm rational explanation of What really happened. This is reddit that was just a case that was reported. i don't know how many terrorist have come in the last 7 years. recruitment fuel? wouldn't us bombing them for 8 years and destroying their lives, families, and country be enough recruitment fuel? i have a lot of theories about what might happen during the ban but, i think that maybe the ban might be to listen to recruitment chatter on the internet, and identify more targets. Or maybe he was informed that a threat was on its way. but we don't know bc he will not tell us about his plans.  curious to know why are his actions are more severe and without provocation when compared to obama? also curious if you have read the executive order on your own or if you heard/read about it in the media you can't undo citizenship but you can prevent new ones. why can all white people when all aren't alt right fanatics? the executive order doesn't deal in absolutes, not all predominantly muslim countries are in the ban. If someone already believes in some philosophy that promotes those things then I'm fine with banning them too. It's not a teeny tiny chance they radicalize, and why is it on us to take that chance. You can't ask enough questions to ascertain an ideology, you cannot vet them.   And I'm not a pussy because if radicals were ravaging my country, I wouldn't run away and leave all the women and children behind and defend my oppressors political system.  I'm sure Islam kills more than that. I don't have the exact numbers but might be a tad bit higher. People need to see the double standards. Rape culture, extreme sexism and brutal murder of homosexuals is a big part of the culture. Everything they pretend to be victims of in the west, are things that happen horrifically under sharia. It is wrong to bring in these people that will live off of our system instead of other legitimate, verifiable COMPATIBLE refugees like South Africans or Ukrainians. Of which we take none. Countrymen didn't die abroad to fight terror just so we could pay for it to come and stay on us. Treason. Then he immediately retracted that to propose the solution that is currently enacted and is not a Muslim ban. You and Trump can wish as hard as you want that this current policy is a Muslim ban but it isn't. [removed] Quit being a pseudo-intellectual the comment was mostly made In jest, you are taking this way more seriously than is normal.     If you really need to call someone an idiot on the internet to feel superior then I suggest you get a hobby and also a sense of humour. The vetting process is very strong?  I think the Boston bombing victims and their families would disagree with you.

"41",40,"5qxyze","2017-01-30","The police considers the attack as an act of terrorism. https://twitter.com/LP_LaPresse/status/825913283702054912 God, the witness they were interviewing on Radio Canada appears to have lost someone in the attack - he broke down in tears towards the end of his interview.   I hope his friends and family are with him tonight. I was in the building right next to the Mosque when it happened, I was watching an amateur musical that my brother and mother played in. We saw a lot of police cars outside at the intermission, I checked my phone and learned at that moment that shots were fired... nobody here saw anything as we were all busy with the play. Police came in after the show, taking names of everyone. Everyone in the building is safe, we're all a bit on edge, these things don't happen in Quebec City...ever. Taxis were waiting for us to bring us home as we can't take our cars out of the scene. A really sad and terrible turnout of what should have been a joyful and peaceful evening for everyone.  EDIT: Since my comment becomes more visible, I want to add a big thank you to Quebec City Police Departement who are obviously not used to deal with this kind of event, the two officers that told us how things will be unfolding did a great job. And of course I also send my thoughts to the families of the victims, I wrote that first draft very quickly when I got home. This has got to be one of the most prolific attacks in canada the last few years, right?? 5 dead? https://www.reddit.com/live/ycrccwu9ld93  Live updates here I live 5 minutes from there. Never such ''big'' thing happend here. It's a weird feeling when such thing happens so close to you.   One of the man killed worked at the halal grocery just down the road from the mosque. Extremely nice guy, me and my mom would often go to the grocery and talk with the guy (mostly my mom).  Canadian national news in french (Radio-Canada) just did a phone interview with a direct witness. It was nerve racking and incredibly sad.   The man was visiting a friend from Montreal and they decided to go to the night prayer. He saw two gunmem with ski mask entering the mosque and opening fire on a group of people. They left really fast and they screamed a bunch of stuff with a really strong quebec accent.   His friend's roomate was shot and they were back home, sobbing. This is not the kind of thing you want to see in your city.   And SPVQ just said it's officially considered as a terror attack Well, fuck. Talked with a friend recently about how shootings are so rare here.. and then.. that happens... Only one of the arrested is now considered a suspect, Alexandre Bissonnette.   http://www.lapresse.ca/le-soleil/justice-et-faits-divers/201701/30/01-5064449-attentat-a-quebec-la-sq-confirme-un-seul-suspect.php  Theres been so much misinformation though that you should definitely wait to draw conclusions. Calice gang... The sun just had this to say   ""According to information from the Sun, the man confirmed to be the perpetrator of the attack against the Islamic Cultural Centre. Said he felt bad because of what he had done and was threatening to shoot himself. The Quebec police then chased a gray Mitsubishi which was then traveling on the Flix-Leclerc highway. The 27-year-old man stopped his vehicle by himself on the edge of the access ramp of the le d'Orlans bridge. He had with him, in the back seat, at least one handgun and two weapons that resembled an AK-47. Around 8:45 pm, he requested to be picked up. The police waited for him to leave his vehicle by himself. Outside, he was arrested by members of the Tactical Intervention Group. It was feared that explosive devices would be on board the Mitsubishi.""  http://www.lapresse.ca/le-soleil/justice-et-faits-divers/201701/30/01-5064423-pris-de-culpabilite-lun-des-suspects-avoue-son-crime-avant-son-arrestation.php ETA:  [TRADUCTION FRANAISE](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5qxyze/shots_fired_in_quebec_city_mosque/dd39m8n/) (hat tip /u/didnt_check_source)  After I got shot, I stalked news coverage of my shooting and read every comment.  On the very slim chance you, person who is reading this right now, was at the scene or knows someone who was:  Whoever you are, I remember what today feels like--and how alone you must feel.  You are not alone.  You're part of a brotherhood now, a brotherhood of people who will do anything for you.  There are--sadly--thousands of us shooting survivors around, and we are all rooting for you to get through this.  You're going to have a tough one to six months, but I promise you, it will get better.    On to a little bit of advice, because you're now in this weird world.    **PRIMARY TIPS**  * **Do not drink to cope with this.**  I stopped drinking until my therapist told me I no longer qualified as having PTSD, and it is probably the only thing that saved me from becoming an alcoholic.  * Find someone to keep track of your hospital and police paperwork.  There will be a lot of it and you will probably not have the emotional fortitude to deal with it, because you will be so pissed off that it's in your life.  A parent, a sibling, a spouse, a friend--tell them they should handle any insurance claims or evidence requests. * If you are offered a victim's advocate's card, **take it.**  I turned one down; better to have it and not need it than the other way around.   * Take advantage of delivery services for groceries and toiletries.  It's okay if your world shrinks. * Keep an eye out for PTSD symptoms.   **PTSD SYMPTOMS**   Please, please be watchful for signs of PTSD.  Here's a list of symptoms to watch out for:  * Having bad dreams at night or have trouble sleeping * Being afraid or nervous * Feeling very sad or angry or without hope * Being forgetful or not able to pay attention * Feeling as if you cannot control your thoughts and memories * Losing or gaining weight * Having headaches, stomach aches or problems eating * Feeling like no one understands you or that your life was stolen from you * Avoiding places with crowds * Drinking or doing drugs * Avoiding talking about the shooting  You might experience a few of these for a while, and then they'll dissipate on their own.  Great!  But if they persist or are interfering with your daily life, you might need to seek professional counseling.  Please hear this: counseling is not anything to be ashamed of.  If you need it, get it.  Seriously.    **WHAT KIND OF COUNSELING SHOULD I GET?**  I did prolonged exposure therapy (PET). Another poster who PMed me did EMDR therapy. Both of us think our therapy methods kicked ass in treating our trauma, which means you'll probably be fine seeking out a good therapist who does either. When you undergo a trauma, your brain pathways basically get knotted up. As a result, when you experience something that reminds you of the trauma, it can feel like you're reliving it. PET and EMDR both try to undo that knot. PET is more like traditional talk therapy, whereas EMDR is more like guided meditation therapy. Both therapies are empirically supported if done properly.  At any rate, the most important thing is to find a **good** therapist. There should be a social worker or police officer who can refer you to a qualified PTSD therapist at the scene or at the hospital. **You will need to see a specialist, not a generalist. You do not want to be the person's first PTSD patient.** I unfortunately do not have recommendations in Canada, but I can offer recommendations for clinics in Minneapolis, New York, Chicago, and Seattle. (If you are a shooting survivor in Quebec or any another city and can recommend a center, please reply to this comment and I will add that information; I am planning to add a list of resources to this post at some point).  **ARE THERE QUEBECOIS RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR ME?**  Yes.  The Quebec Justice Department website [English](http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/rec-ress-a.htm) [French] (http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/francais/publications/generale/rec-ress.htm) collects many resources.  It also lays out your rights.  As a crime victim, you have a right to be treated with dignity and respect.  You are going to have an opportunity to be heard and to be informed.  You may have a right to financial assistance.  Additional information is available through the [Canadian Resource Center for Victims of Crime](https://crcvc.ca/) (hat tip /u/bradellsW).  **DOES IT GET BETTER?**  Yes.  You're not the first person to go through this, as awful as it is. The next few months might be hell, but it can get better. I'm about two years out from being shot, and life is fairly normal these days. I sleep fine. I can go to places that look like where I got shot.  I promise you, it will get easier--and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions about what to expect.    *If you are also a shooting survivor and would like to help me refine the above text, or if you know of a qualified PTSD therapist or center anywhere in the world, please PM me and I will add that information to this text the next time I post this.*  ETA 1:  Added information about EMDR therapy.  ETA 2:  Added request for French translation.  ETA 3:  Thank you for the repeated gildings--they help with visibility--but I would love it so much if you would instead donate to a Quebecois charity that provides high-quality therapy and/or social services.  The Canadian Resource Center for Victims of Crime or the Canadian Red Cross would also be great options.   ETA 4:  Added links to Canadian/Quebecois resources.

That's going to be my last edit. According to the Article the shooter will have a court appearance sometime today. I would keep an eye on *La Presse*, *Radio-Canada*, *TVA*, and *La Journal de Quebec* for the latest updates as they will have the biggest presence on the ground and best sources. This is truly horrible. Condolences to lost ones. I hope everyone is safe now. Muslim Quebecer here. I know that Quebec might have a special reputation, but I want to stress that it's an amazing province and what happened tonight represent nothing that Quebec and its people stand for. It's not a perfect place but never in my life did I feared for myself.  I hope that the perpetrators will be arrested as soon as possible. Shit that's like a kilometer away from here. Holy crap. As a Quebecer, i'm quite stressed. This shit usually never happen in our province. Non  la violence, oui  la paix.  Police department confirm that only one of the two arrested is suspect the other is a witness  https://twitter.com/sureteduquebec/status/826114232630571011  https://twitter.com/sureteduquebec/status/826114424448679936  Fucking terrible. I'm not particularly religious but it seems to me committing a crime where you're supposed to be safe is extra fucked up.  I hope people call this what it is. A terrorist attack.  Interesting why isn't this back up on r/all now [removed] I'm a resident of Quebec City and were all shocked! The mayor just said in an interview our city proudly notice a full year without any murder last week... Our city is so beautiful and peacefull, kinda surreal!! :( Can people at least wait a few hours for the facts to come out before twisting this to support their pro/anti Trump narrative? There are so many vultures just hopping on this as an excuse to be condescending.  Have some respect for the victims. Latest info on suspects? The new deflection is going to be claiming everyone on r/worldnews was jumping the gun and biased.   If you look quick before they delete their posts, you'll see there were about 50 posts claiming it was Muslims for every post that claimed it was surely white supremacists.  I'm a citizen of Quebec who lives about 20minutes from there and I can just say I'm really confused... Quebec is one of those multiculturalist places where there is a lot and respect and peace... We are already on all news... We looks so wrong right now... I just hope this won't happend again cuz it seems like some people are angry about Trudeau decision about refugess.  My most sincere condolences to the affected families...   A pig head was left at this same mosque last year.  https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/06/21/quebec-city-police-investigating-after-pigs-head-left-outside-mosque.html From Twitter. Obviously take with grain of salt at this time  >A witness, told CBC's French-language service:  >""They had a Quebecois accent. They started to fire, and they yelled, 'Allahu akbar!' #Quebec  I was not expecting something like this to happen in Canada.  I'm in shock. I'm a French Canadian and I lived in Qubec city all my life.  It's such a peaceful place (We usually have 1-2 murders a year) and gun violence is so rare.   I just don't understand...     La Presse is reporting that the police are treating this as a terror attack. The guys who did this are monsters. No matter your faith, or choice not to have any, it is not for anyone to decide who should live and who should die based on their own ideas about the world. It makes me sick, and very sad. This is a disgusting waste of human life, both for those lost and those who decided to murder innocent people.   Fuck hate. It only makes everything worse. Only love can help to heal from this. I live in hope that the world will wake up and realize that one day.  Fuck these assholes... sounds like they already have them in custody, good work law enforcement. (2 or 3 suspects taken alive, is kinda of surprising tbh)    I don't care what political, religious, or whatever leanings you have. Actions like this are NOT the answer.    May justice be served swiftly... and those who lost loved ones find find some comfort in that.   Left: Please be White.  Right: Please be Muslim.  ""Suspects are Alexandre Bissonnette and Mohamed Khadir""  Everyone: wtf?? CBC is now reporting 6 dead, 8 injured: http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-city-mosque-gun-shots-1.3957686 Quebec Premier refused to answer question on Identity. [removed] I'm an american and stayed in Sainte-Foy a few months ago during my vacation in Quebec and I've got to say I am completely taken aback by this. The Quebecois are one of the kindest groups of people I've ever encountered.  I hope the people who committed this abhorrent crime are brought to justice.  So wait, Mosques have a man only section and a woman only section? Like bathrooms? Is there a reason for that? This is terrible. My heart goes out to the families!  [removed] [removed] How do three guys with AK's manage to kill only 8 people in room full of 60? Trump supporters have brigaded this thread.  The shooter IS a white canadian who subsribed to far white nationalist ideology Canadians blame Qubec nationalism.   Montrealers blame the conservatism of Qubec city and their media.   Conservatives blame liberals and the whole muslim community.   Liberals blame Trump.    I'm proud to be one of the few who blame those 2 massive idiots who shot people. So much false information going around.  People, wait for the facts!  It's just been confirmed by the Quebec Provincial Police there is one suspect in custody.  A Quebecois man by the name of Alexandre Bisonnette.  There was NEVER a Moroccan suspect in custody, he was a WITNESS.    SOURCE: http://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/live-blog/quebec-mosque-shooting#/  EDIT:  Adding another source since it looks like the headline wasn't updated: http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-city-mosque-gun-shots-1.3957686 Alexandre Bissonnette is now considered the only suspect.  The Moroccan guy they also caught was just some guy at the scene they decided might also be guilty.  Oops.   I'm not going to blame anyone or jump to any conclusions but I feel like this one was really bad timing... I feel bad for every Mohamed Khadir residing in Canada, the news should get their facts straight before releasing names. Mohamed and Khadir are both common names. why are they not releasing information about the shooter? [removed] Merde.  Awful, as a Canadian this disgusts me. I hope everyone responsible are brought to justice and anyone supporting this are set straight.  I think we should wait and see before we determine who caused this Alexandre Bissonnette is the only suspect. Where are people getting the ""Muslim on Muslim attack"" from? The other man, Mohammed, was a witness... holy reddit you guys jump to conclusions fast.    [removed] fighting percieved extremism with actual extremism, that always works right [removed] If it's a white terrorist, right wingers will say that we aren't all like that and the left will have complete confirmation bias thinking that right wingers are nazis. If it's a muslim/ethnic minority, the left will say we arent all like that, and the right will have complete confirmation bias that all immigrants or Muslims are terrorists. Either way, this is going to be a shit show.  Stop killing people.  Anyone who shoots people in a place of religious worship, regardless the religion is a big time fucked up person. It takes a true coward to go shoot up a bunch of praying people.  I hope they're going after this with the same conviction if it were the other way around [removed] Dark times man. Sending love to those affected.  Was in Quebec city about 2 weeks ago. This is horrifying and Im deeply saddened that this may taint Quebec and make Muslims afraid of the place. When I was there everyone was very kind and welcoming. Do not let this deter you. Thoughts and prayers from Toronto My thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the terrorism attack tonight. Please stop spreading hatred in times of grief. Man, people in this world should chill the fuck out and not going on a killing spree when people disagree with them  6 dead confirmed, that's awful  Quebec provincial police confirmed 6 death and  8 injured  Quebec Premier up at 1:30am  , that's a first, giving a presser Sending my friends up north some love Anything on attackers/their motivation yet? Close friend of mine has family members who go to this mosque and she hasn't been able to get in touch with them all yet :( it's so scary, I can't help but shake my head in disbelief and sadness when I read this. What a tumultuous time... [removed] If the shooters were white, We would not only know their names and faces but also their favorite Billy Bob Thornton film by now. You alright up there Canada? :( Muslim Quebec here. It amazes how quickly and how unequivocally our Quebecois community leaders and elected officials from all levels of office have denounced the shooting. Makes me proud of my fellow citizens and makes me feel like a valued part of the the greater community.    As as side note, when attacks are perpetrated by self-identifying muslims, muslim community leaders should be as quick and unequivocal in denouncing these kinds of attacks. It makes a hell of a difference to the communities that are affected by this kind of violence.       Terrible news, makes me incredibly upset.  I hope the pieces of garbage responsible are prosecuted to the full extent of the law. http://www.euronews.com/2017/01/30/trudeau-condemns-terror-attack-after-quebec-mosque-shooting  According to euronews and other news media,  >Radio Canada has reported (in French), quoting a police source, that the suspects are students enrolled at Laval University and that one was of Moroccan origin. There is no confirmation of these details. Suspects identified:  1. Alexandre Bissonnette, a Quebecer 2. Mohamed Kadir, a Morocan  Edit: corrected spelling. FYI, there is no evidence that Bissonnette is gay. http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-city-mosque-gun-shots-1.3957686  Someone said the attackers yelled Allah Akbar, but then again the shooter could have been mocking them by shouting it, let's wait and see. The things that people are saying to promote their political beliefs right now is absolutely disgusting Funny to see ppl saying ""why muslim would attack other muslim"" when at the same time they are the first to say ""Muslim are the first victim of islamic terrorism"" (which it's true). [removed] Where the hell are the suspects names? Why haven't they been released!? [removed] Either way they'll blame trump for it  So tolerant.  Isn't ""native Quebec origin"" just simply synonymous with ""born there"" in law enforcement PC speak?  People still died, regardless of the shooter, remember that [removed] I have a feeling that the names would have been released by now if it fit the narrative of the Canadian Prime minister.  As a Quebecer from Moroccan descent, that's fucking scary. I seriously hope this is an isolated incident, this is not the path I want my nation to take. All shooters being listed thus far are fake, for what it's worth.  [removed] When this first happened, I thought ""no way Muslims would attack their own in the west.""  And here I am, 4 hours later, eating crow and acknowledging Coulter's Law.  [removed] [removed] Next time I'll wait for the all the facts. Guess I was wrong.  Fox news really wanted the Moroccan guy the be the shooter. They still have him highlighted as the chief suspect. They'll probably report the reality sometime later with the smallest font as possible...  Edit: [Still](http://imgur.com/a/AwxHL)  Edit2: They still have the link saying [Moroccan](http://imgur.com/a/AwxHL), but when [clicked](http://imgur.com/a/Q1CwY), it talks about only  Alexandre Bissonnette now.  Amazing...  Edit3: [As suspected, they pushed down the headline with a smaller font and removed moroccan](http://imgur.com/a/bWDRZ)  Fox Keeping it real... If the attackers were non-Islamists then we'd have their full bios by now with their pictures being blown up to maximum resolution all over the mainstream media. My god some of these comments are horrible.   ""One of the two men arrested in connection with the terrorist attack in a Quebec mosque is of Quebec origin and the other Arab."" What does that mean? You can be a Qubcois and an Arab at the same time so I'm a little confused about this sentence. Both could be Arabs, a Qubcois one and an Arab foreigner or a white Qubcois and an Arab Qubcois. Sure is taking police awhile to release details about the two terrorists... gotta love CNN for only covering the protests to fit their narrative My condolences to Quebec and everyone unfortunate enough to be involved. Must be the worst thing in the world to be a moderate Muslim these days. You get shit on for being too Muslim from non-Muslims and shit on for being not Muslim enough from extremists.  STOP KILLING PEOPLE YOU FUCKING DISGUSTING INHUMANE FUCKS Jesus fuck, not here too! Not just dead, bud. Murdered. For no good reason by some spineless pieces of shit. RIP man with majestic beard. Taken by guilt, one of the suspects confesses to the police before his arrest.  http://www.lapresse.ca/le-soleil/justice-et-faits-divers/201701/30/01-5064423-pris-de-culpabilite-lun-des-suspects-avoue-son-crime-avant-son-arrestation.php  Rough translation:  20:12h, 17 minutes after the first 911 call, one of the suspects called the authorities to confess his crime.  He said he was the author of the attack and felt bad about it, saying he might kill himself.  At that time, Suret du Qubec (SQ- Province of Qubec police) helped the Qubec Pollice (the city), trying to catch him on a highway.  The guy, 27, stopped his car on a bridge going to Orlans island, having a handgun and 2 guns that looked like AK-47s on the back seat.  Around 20:45, he said he wanted to be arrested by the police. The SWAT team waited for him to get out of the car (a Mitsubishi).  01:15 the bridge is still closed and RCMP explosive technicians were there, fearing explosive devices.    Article says:  >One witness described the suspects as two masked men with a Quebecois accent who shouted ALLAHU AKHBAR. He saw the man next to him drop dead He says that a friend of his friend died.  The witness is from Montreal and was there to see his friend that just got married.  Source: I live in Quebec City  It was indeed heartbreaking to listen to, the TV annoncer also had to take a second to recuperate. I hope this guy is taken care of. I know I feel bad for him  I was watching (it happened not even a mile away from where I live) and it was so heartbreaking to listen to ... What a dumb world we live in where we have to use violence as way of getting through to people.  Do you have a link to it? I live 5 minutes from There.... I dont undertand, Qubec is like the last place i'd imagine something like that to happen. Everybody i know is so kind here... yeah shit man, most towns in Quebec, you feel very safe like 99% of the time. I'm much more affraid of getting lost in a town than getting robbed on a street. Never ever felt afraid to walk late at night. This happening is weird as hell... Thanks for informing us all. Be sure to update us if you find out a thing else.  Glad you are safe! Glad to hear you are safe.  Two questions:  Did the taxi guys charge you?  What do you like to bake? There was a shooting in La Loche Sask about a year ago. 4 were killed and 7 injured by the shooting. This was at a high school.  There was one at a school in Saskatchewan last year.  I believe 4 or 5 were killed.  I think it flew under the radar a bit because it was a ""native"" area of the country. Correct. The last notable mass shooting involving a targeted group was in 1989.  A gunman struck a post-secondary school and asked men to leave the class. He proceeded to kill the 14 women inside.  He then commited suicide.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/cole_Polytechnique_massacre The Mountie shootings were three years ago in Moncton, NB - but idk how big a deal that was in the rest of Canada. Update: 2 arrested. 5 dead, 10 injured. You know, I've never walked around my province thinking we were immune to this sort of thing. Still hits pretty hard. [removed] I too live about 5 mins from there... I pass in-front of that mosque (formerly a Caisse) every day...  Practically all my neighbors here go to that mosque...  I know the feeling, man. I grew up in Sandy Hook CT, and Ill never forget the day my old elementary school became the focal point of all the violence going on today. You never expect it to happen so close, no matter where you live. But people are only in control of themselves. Sometimes even less than we'd like to believe. My thoughts and prayers go out to your home, mon amis. Hold your loved ones a little tighter today. How do you already know the victims? I'm in Boston and the news has reported jack shit this far.  I'm from Orlando. Born and raised. I know exactly what you mean.  i lived across the street from the Pulse shooting and slept right through it... certainly is a wierddddd feelin > They left really fast and they screamed a bunch of stuff with a really strong quebec accent.  Interesting, has there been any reporting on what they screamed? They had a Quebec accent as they were yelling Allah Akbar.  http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-city-mosque-gun-shots-1.3957686 Maybe you should discuss how often people find jobs and get in meaningful careers that they find enjoyable and fulfillment in life and it'll happen! Calice, en effet. Who are they? Tabarnak... Deux crisses de motts. Sacrement que c'est dgueulasse. Tabarnak, c'est incroyable. Mon coeur fait mal.  Edit: Ma to mon. Pas mal le fond de ma pense aussi... Fallait ben qu'a arrive icitte criss... This guy must have gone through the attack in his mind many times. The feelings he had while he was fantasizing didn't stop him from shooting people IRL. Only after he saw the dead people did he feel guilty. There is something very depressing about that human reality.     Aprs quon mait tir dessus, jai suivi la couverture mdiatique de la tuerie dans laquelle jai t bless et jai lu tous les commentaires.

Il y en aura beaucoup et tu nauras probablement pas la force motionnelle pour les grer. Un parent, un frre ou une sur, femme ou mari, un ami: demande-leur de grer les demandes dassurance et les requtes de la police. * Si un avocat de victimes toffre une carte daffaires, **prend-la**.

Cest correct que ton monde rtrcisse un peu. * Sois vigilant vis--vis les symptmes de stress post-traumatique.  ## SYMPTMES DE STRESS POST-TRAUMATIQUE  Sil-te-plat, fais attention aux signes de stress post-traumatique.

Excellent! Mais sils persistent ou interfrent avec ta vie quotidienne, tu pourrais devoir demander conseil  un professionnel. Sil-te-plat, coute bien: il ny a aucune honte  suivre une thrapie. Si tu en as besoin, trouve un thrapeute. Srieusement.  ## QUELLE SORTE DE THRAPIE DEVRAIS-JE SUIVRE?  Jai eu une thrapie dexposition prolonge. Un autre membre ma crit par message priv quil avait suivi une thrapie de dsensibilisation des mouvements oculaires et retraitement. Nous pensons tous les deux que la mthode que nous avons suivie a eu un excellent impact sur le traitement de notre traumatisme, donc tu pourrais bien ten sortir avec nimporte laquelle. Lorsque tu subis un traumatisme, essentiellement, les connexions dans ton cerveau sentre-mlent. Le rsultat est que lorsque tu vis quelque chose qui te rappelle le traumatisme, cest comme si tu le revivais. La thrapie dexposition prolonge et la thrapie de dsensibilisation des mouvements oculaires et retraitement tentent toutes les deux de les dmler. Lexposition prolonge est plus traditionnelle et implique plus de parler, alors que lautre est plus comme une thrapie de mditation guide. Les deux sont prouves si bien effectues. Quoi quil en soit, le plus important est de trouver un **bon** thrapeute. Il devrait y avoir un travailleur social ou un policier qui pourrait te rfrer  un thrapeute pour stress post-traumatique sur la scne ou  lhpital. **Tu dois trouver un spcialiste, pas un gnraliste. Tu ne veux pas tre le premier patient de stress post-traumatique du thrapeute.** Je nai malheureusement pas de recommandations pour le Canada, mais je peux donner des recommandations pour Minneapolis, New York, Chicago et Seattle.

I hope you're on the way to healing. Thank you for using your experiences to help others--this is what it takes to make the world better.  thank you Great advice! You always want to see a *specialist* when dealing with mental health. Many medical professionals claim they can treat disorders and unfortunately the truth is many of them are wrong and cannot. You must see someone who has done extensive studying and research and has experience treating what you are going through. Thank you for writing this. You're a good person. Great *great* post.   Thank you. If this wasn't a throwaway, I'm sure we'd find gold piled up here. Amazing thing you're doing putting it into writing. (Qubec) Gunfire at a mosque in Quebec City has resulted in ""death and many injured"" Sunday evening during prayer time at the Mosque. Two suspects have been stopped: one on the premises, and the other on l'le d'Orlans. According to La Presse, the Quebec Government considers the gunfire as an act of terrorism.  Around the time of publishing, it is suspected that there are five dead. This number was brought up by many figures including the president of the Islamic Cultural Centre, Mohamed Yangui, where the attack took place. He would have gotten the information from people who were inside when the gunfire started at 7:55PM. Prayer time at the mosque normally attracts between 60 and 100 worshippers.   At the end of the evening, Quebec Police, who had created a large security perimeter, have not released a timeline of events. At one point just before 10PM, they only addressed the press to say ""there were confirmed deaths and many injured.""  Agent tienne Doyon announced that two suspects had been stopped and arrested for murder, and that it is possible that another suspect is still on the loose. ""Police have not dismissed teh idea that there could be another suspect. We have not yet dismissed this possibility, and we are keeping an open mind,"" said Mr. Doyon.   The police has not disclosed the way in which the shooter/shooters entered into the mosque in the Sainte-Foy neighbourhood.  Still, according to Mohamed Yangui, the shooter had the time to reload his weapon on three occasions. This information has not been confirmed yet by the police.  Suspects at l'le d'Orlans  Around 9PM, a large security perimetre was established at the entrance to the l'le d'Orlans bridge. It would have likely been through here that the suspect would have fled after the attack.  There were around 10 police cars stationed there, as well as the Tactical Invention Unit of the Quebec City Police Force. It is here that the second suspect was stopped, by police, according to information gathered by Le Soleil.  The l'le d'Orlans bridge, and the roads around the south side of the bridge were closed to traffic during the police operation which didn't end until 10PM.  One of the two suspects is 27 years old. One of the suspects allegedly had an AK-47 in his possession.  When asked about these sad events, Mohamed Yangui asked himself what could have motivated these shooters to commit these acts: ""We're being told that it's an isolated incident, but what's the message that we're supposed to take from this? What should we be saying to the Quebecois and Canadian Muslim Community at large?""    ""They had placed a severed pig's head on the front steps of our Mosque during the summer. At that point, the police also told us it was an isolated incident. Yet, today, we have people who have died. It's been terrifying and painful."" The president of the Islamic Cultural Centre mentioned certain other hate crimes that had happened, but none of the others have happened in particularly recent times.   Everyone has had their eyes glued to their cellphones nervous about any developments related to close friends and loved ones. They are all seeking information to confirm whether someone they know is among the victims.   Reported by Camille B. Vincent in collaboration with Steve Jolicoeur  _____________________  That's the full translation done by hand of the cited French article. [5 dead now](https://mobile.twitter.com/FoxNews/status/825893884672749568) 2 have already been arrested apparently.  Christian Quebecer here, and you're 100% right. Never in a million year would I think that would happen so close to home. It's bonkers. Atheist Quebecer here. It's horrible what has happened. People should be able to practice their religion or meditate or go for beers with friends or anything without worrying about this kind of violence. My thoughts are with your community. it's been years since a murder in quebec city if i can remeber at least We understand. As someone from the flyover region of the US, I'm acutely aware of the disconnect between the decency of the average person living here and the perceptions others might have based on the actions of a vocal few. In my state's capitol, a right-wing terrorist murdered 2 police officers right before the election. Of course, it was national news. Yet, I feel safe here. My family never locked our doors growing up, yet we were never once burgled.   We know those people don't stand for what you believe in. No matter where you are in the world, terrorists almost never do. Too often we demonize an entire region, ethnicity, or religion based on the shameful actions of a few. It's just too easy to do when those few garner global attention with their actions, and good people like you never make the news.  Thank you for doing your part in defending the reputation of your home and your religion. I'm sorry you have to. I'm an french quebecois, thanks you. They are part of the problem, not the solution. Atheist Quebecer here. I know we have our reputation (deserved or not), but one strong Quebec value is our pacifism. For every war Canada ever went, our province always voted against (yes, even the two world wars) and we never encouraged any sort of warfare. War and violence is never the solution.  I hope those fuckers get 25 years of prison, so they can see that what they did was for absolutely nothing. And that they get out when they are old (yeah, I want them to get out after 25 years), so they see that the society where they live now forgot about them and grew up past that. I want them to know that they wasted their fucking life for absolutely no reason. I want them to know that nothing grew from that, that they were wrong, that the rest of their life is big circlejerk of regret.    Never expecting this to happen in fucking Ste-foy right? > committing a crime where you're supposed to be safe is extra fucked up.  I mean...  that should be everywhere... Not only that, they were in the middle of prayer.   Ever been to a mosque, or know how Muslims pray? They get down on their hands and knees, and touch their heads to the ground, symbolizing that the head- the most important part of the body, is humble before their God.   That's fucked up that someone would target it at such a time. It's just has been said that it's a terrorist attack on TVA news so there's that.  They were extremely smug about it too. Many of them laughing and using language like I told you so. 2 losers doesnt define a nation Fucking disgusting. On some level I can at least understand how people could be afraid of people different than them. But I will never be able to understand how people can be so hateful to innocent people. Quebec city of all place too Only suspect is Alexandre Bissonnette. We know what this means. Modesty. When women bend over we look hot and it's distracting during prayer.  I think it's the religion requires men and women be segregated. I've seen some fits over university guest lecturers refusing to speak if the room was segregated (UK).  It's because muslims can't even tolerate themselves. They're alternatively progressive. I'll be honest, I'm about 90% sure it wasn't AK's, too hard to get around here.  I'm leaning towards low capacity hunting rifles and no actual experience using them. This is why you don't report people's names until you have all the info.    Oh yes.  If the shooters were Muslim, this will be very bad for the left, and if the shooters were white, this will be very bad for the right. Ann Coulter's law:  ""The longer that it takes the media to identify the shooter, the less likely he is white and Christian."" Would you?  If they do and he/she has family or accomplices they might rush to get rid of any evidence related. They don't care if people on reddit want to know, they have work to do. [removed] Whoa, being a little too level-headed aren't you? Lots of people spreading false information. I was just reading a conservative leaning forum who, for 10 pages, were convinced it was 2 Syrian refugees.  Now that they know he's white they think he's a Muslim convert.  Someone said they heard Muslim names on the police scanner and t_d was spamming about Syrian refugees all last night. r/The_Donald spreading false bullshit as usual. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] Terrorism. Call it what it is. It's already a shit show. A parody news account tweeted names and actual new accounts ran it. Everyone wants to break this so bad. The government is keeping this close because who the fuck knows if there are other attackers or plots. They'll adventually tell us, but the whole search for confirmation bias is gross. As a Canadian, I'm confident this will be handled by the locals and the feds as a terrorist attack. Three gunmen just butchered Canadian citizens *at prayer* with an AK-47. This kind of thing does not happen here. People will be shocked tomorrow morning, and scared. The Liberal government will have to try to go hard after these attackers and find out what caused them to do this. They score points with the right for appearing tough on crime, they score points with the left for sticking up for a minority.  Canada's usually pretty good at that.  Toronto is the city with the highest percent of foreign born residents in the world.  The government does a pretty good job expressing a need for diversity and tolerance.  They even had a TV show called little mosque on the prairie for a bit. There seems to be one or two accounts that keep posting false info or screenshots of false info No man. Tomorrow is going to be ugly. Shit. They are going to feel so vulnerable tomorrow. I think the kids especially will be difficult to convince that this is a highly unusual event.  Don't worry bud. Lived here all my life. You'll die in a ski-doo accident way before getting shot. Unfortunately the damage is already done. When false information comes out immediately after an even there's always some number of conspiracy lovers who then hold on to the belief that the initial report was the gospel truth and that everything after is an attempt to suppress the truth. There are still some holding on to the belief that there was a third shooter at San Bernardino since that was the initial reports. [removed] [removed] both sides of the major companies can't risk it going against their narrative. The smaller news companies have more to gain from getting on the actual story. Someone admitted they were wrong on the internet? Call the papers!   Take an upvote You should always do that even when it seems clear. It only spreads misinformation if you don't wait, regardless. I watched a reporter get hit in the face with a rock live on CNN, and he still claimed the protest was peaceful. Then 20 minutes later it cuts back to him and he says the young man who threw the rock apologized.   lol  You heard him guys. He posted to stop killing people on Reddit. Wrap it up  So they're either two guys pretending to be Muslim or two radical Muslims trying to kill mainstream Muslims, if the eyewitness account is to be trusted.  in either case, I'm glad the situation is now contained and we had so few casualties. It would have been a lot worse, if the nightclub shooting in the US is anything to go by.  ~~**EDIT 1:** A few of you are laughing at the idea of people pretending to be Muslim. I said that thinking back to a story I read about a gunman in the US that pretended to be Muslim, but after looking it up I couldn't find anything. I'm wrong.~~  **EDIT 2:** Yes, there's a third option: they could be saying it mockingly.  **EDIT 3:** The racists are coming out strong tonight.  **EDIT 4:** [I was right](http://www.lapresse.ca/le-soleil/justice-et-faits-divers/201701/30/01-5064449-attentat-a-quebec-la-sq-confirme-un-seul-suspect.php). Theoretically it could not be terrorism if it were an extreme fallout from personal relationships within the mosque. However, that seems incredibly unlikely. Ah... unfortunately, my French has somewhat atrophied since my high school graduation :( I recorded it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IBBJLpydUM It only takes one. I'm much more afraid of QC drivers than I am of random gunmen. I did have to pay, police officers told us earlier that we can ask the City's office for a refund, I don't really mind at the moment. As for your other question, I make excellent pies! Yea that was in La Loche. Very northern town in Sask. It was crazy to think anything like that would happen in this province.  La Loche? No it was covered pretty well in my parts. Under the radar? No way it was covered nearly around the clock for days on CBC radio, TV, and internet in Calgary. I know because I listen to CBC religiously.   I'll post what I said below: La Loche was, and remains in the minds and hearts of Canadians across the country. You're trivializing the compassion of Canadians by suggesting that its was a ""15 minutes of fame"" situation. CBC continues to report on the community to this day.  That's my university.. I highly recommend the movie based on the events, ""[Polytechnique](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1194238/),"" directed by.. Denis Villeneuve. Man we still talk about this event in schools when referring as to why we have a code for gunman attack. That was terrible... Wow. I've never heard of this before. And before killing the 14 women he said that it was because he hated feminist. He also wrote a letter where he said that women and feminist where a threat to men and made a much bigger list of target with the names of feminists or women with 'men' jobs. I think it's important to recall that. That's actually incorrect. Moncton was a targeted shooting against police and only police.  I believe the Dawson shooting was more recent. Not many people died although a crazy person did go into a school and start shooting.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawson_College_shooting What about the Parliament attack a few years ago? It was the lead story on the BBC World Service as I bobbed on a cruise ship in the Mediterranean. My Dad who was there with me grew up in Moncton, so it was a shock to say the least.  The same mosque has been targeted before: http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/pig-head-left-on-door-of-quebec-city-mosque-during-ramadan [removed] Probably, can't really tell I never payed attention to the name of the store. We refer to it as the '' Boucherie halal '', halal meat store or what ever you want to call it, they also sell amazing hamburgers.  But it used to be a video and video game rental store, It's infront of a vape shop and a bakery.  I sincerely hope none of your neighbors were hurt or killed. Stay safe!  My neighbor downstairs is Muslim, he knows who goes to the mosque, and is friend with the man in question (he also obviously knows people who go to the mosque) and his family. He told my mom.  well if he lives 5mins away big chance he might know some of them. Same. I used to frequent Pulse. Still have a hard time talking about it, but I'm sending you love too. From what I understood from the interview, I think they screamed Allahu Akbar with a strong colon Quebec accent  NASA, here I come! I think that's the plan of the folks over at /r/wholesomememes But he said something *doesn't* happen and it happened... Yuup, caliss. Just an English comment passing through  Osti crissss de tabarnak, sti calisse de viargeeeeee No idea, I am from the city. I was just saying ""God damn it people"" using Quebec slang. Quebec us very peaceful, this kind of event is very rare and clearly do not reflect the population. Especially if this end-up a hate crime. I am very happy that my tax will help victims, law enforcement and to put in jail these criminals. Pi l a va agiter tout le monde. Et il va y avoir des reprsailles par d'autres innocents du mme genre. a me rend malade...  2 mins  pied d'o j'ai habit pendant 2 ans... tabarnak. a me fait freaker. THANK YOU.  I added a section on Quebecois resources.  If you will edit this comment to include that, I will link this comment at the top of my post.  Am I correct in thinking I could just say traduction Franaise as the hyperlink?  Holy Fucking Shit! some of those comments are beyond retarded. Wow those replies are cancerous. My thoughts go out to all those affected. Jewish girl from Quebec agreeing with both of you. It's an absolute travesty. This is not representative of the population. This is completely unrelated, but I have to say it.  I've been living in Texas for the last two years, Raleigh before that, but I grew up in Ottawa.  I forgot how much I like French accents.  I can literally hear your ~~scent~~ accent through your text, French is a pretty cool language.  Back to reality: I'm so sorry this happened in Quebec.  Of all of the cities in Canada for this to occur, this would have literally been the last on any list I could have made.  Quebec might have gone a little overboard with the language requirements, but I've never met a truly bad person from Quebec.  If you're anywhere near Montreal, please light a candle at the Oratory on my behalf.  Edited because swype fail made me look drunk.   Edit again so everyone new knows why I'm being (rightfully) mocked in the below comments for my fat fingers failing with swype.  I only remembered the second typo, if anyone remembers the first one let me know. Crazies gonna crazy. As a Quebecer, thanks for this. I fear many Canadians might be quick to cry ""bunch of french speaking racists"" as I've seen happen far too many times on here. The reputation is undeserved.  Exactly, it will unite us against hate from wherever it comes from. It's an attack against all humanity and decency. Wait, literally years since a single murder? Are you sure? Jun 29 2016:  >In the middle of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, a regular at a Quebec City mosque finished a prayer in the early hours of Sunday only to find a pig's head at the doorstep as he was leaving.  >The package, found in front of one of the doors of the Islamic cultural centre of Quebec City around 2:30 a.m., was accompanied by a note: ""Bon apptit.""  http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/pig-head-mosque-quebec-city-1.3642883 You said it, I've lived here basically all my life. Most peaceful place you can think of. Shit's insane. The true height of cowardice. Fucking cowards. They literally became what they hated and feared. I live 5 minutes from there. There has been years without any single murders in recent history... Nothing at all, as he was white.  How does that change your opinions?  Not at all I expect, in fact you probably are actually hardening your beliefs in opposition to evidence. What if they're white muslims? [removed] [removed] [removed] the fake twitter account was like News Braek with ""break"" spelled wrong. the desperation is pathetic and unprofessional but there will be no penalties  When someone kills for idealogical reasons it's terrorism. Sometimes the individual is mentally ill and not managing their condition correctly is what contributed to their willingness to attack, in which case the whole thing becomes a question of if it's terrorism or just an insane person murdering because they are influenced by irrational doctrine and thoughts.   How can the government, other then preemptive arrests stop people who are crazy enough to murder other human beings, it's not a rational desire.  Is CNN the one that titled ""Syrian man denied asylum dies in Germany explosion""   Where in actually, a syrian terorrist blew himself up at a festival.  we just need to wait to find out the actual facts. both the r/politics and r/thedonald people in this thread are jumping to conclusions. i think everyone can agree it's best to wait for the facts before we rush to any judgments based off of very little info so far. probably should also note that allahbu akhbar is a thing commonly said at mosques and eyewitnesses tend to be terrible  >""The QC mosque still has the smell of cordite in the air & ppl I follow on twitter are blaming others who have different opinions than them instead of allowing those of different opinions to share their grief.  >I'm implementing a new personal policy as of tonight to shed those of you (left, centre, right) who can't even wait a day before you start crying and pointing at the other side when something happens. ""  >- Jody Mitic, Ottawa City Councillor & Afghanistan War Veteran  I think it's important we wait at least 24 hours for all the information to become available before pointing fingers and forming opinions on a tragedy. He also had a strong accent and audio quality was not great Yeah the interviewer was really shaken as well. The poor guy was so polite. ""my friend died madam, in front of me man...""   Fuck this Couldn't understand any of that but he starts breaking down and crying after 4:30 Suicide rate is pretty high, it's not unreasonable to think it would lead to this.  They really need help there.   Not to go off track, but he is an absolutely amazing director for anyone not into films/in the know, I highly recommend his work!  Out of curiosity, how did the code change as a response to the attack?  I think there's a poster/mural to remind you of it in every engineering university building in Canada. I'm from Montreal and it's our own Columbine here.   I moved to Quebec city a few months ago and literally had a conversation with my girlfriend about how safe it is and how it's one of the safest cities in all of Canada and less than a week later, this happens Yea, oh no. I have bought from there many times. Oh no,was he the bearded man? He was such a kind soul. Ironic.  Al-salam means ""the peace"".    Very sad weekend for Muslims, and the world.   I think he was the owner of the store. I knew he frequented the mosque a lot. Well it's a pretty standard greeting. I say my salams even though I'm not a Muslim at all. It breaks the ice and it almost always works. I read the none as one at first glance. Oufh. Wow, I'm sorry. If I knew him even in passing like that, I'd be gutted. Wow, its crazy how reddit has enabled us to get such detailed information about an account before the media.   Edit: I guess i should add that we should be careful about information on the internet as well (a la Bosting Bombing)  Space cadet first class. Gosh bless that sub J't'en criss https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvR6-SQzqO8   this might help I thought it was a criminal gang in Quebec. >.> > chalice  I always found it interesting how some of the swear words in Quebec are just various props in a catholic church.  Chalice, Tabernacle, Host, [etc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_French_profanity).    I feel like you guys need to work in ""stained glass windows"" and ""collection plate"" somehow.    What?!? You don't know about the Quebec city's Calice Gang? Very dangerous people! I second what /u/zeddotes said. The hearts of all Canadians are with those in Quebec City. Sad that so many on my Facebook are already calling out Qubec as a racist city with racist media. Jeff Fillion apparently represents everyone....  Sincerely hope people can try to distinguish the actions of a few from the city's population as a whole. Thanks for clarifying. I am your neighbour, an Ontarian. Thoughts and prayers are with you eh c'est des suppositions, garde espoir que les gens raliseront que ce n'est pas ce qu'on veut au Qubec.   videmment, y'a des crisses de motts pas mal crinqus ailleurs aussi. Cependant, je crois qu'on est assez progressistes au Qubec pour dsirer autre chose.  Yep, ""traduction franaise"" is what you're looking for. I see some people in there talking about how gun control here in Canada is a failure. Like what??? As saddening as this is, a horrific event like this is rare in Canada. And guess where all the illegal guns in Canada come from.... Seriously, people wonder how terrible opinions, racism, etc. make their way into government. Just look at these people. Its sad.  Thank you for those wicked bagels.  Jewish guy from Toronto. I miss the Quebec bagels transgendered lesbian african canadian agreeing with you > hear your scent  I know this is a typo but it's absolutely hilarious haha. I don't think anyone will call these men sane, but I feel it's important to recognize that these aren't just the actions of a few ""crazy"" people. These gunmen are cold calculating terrorists. Naw we won't think that. Nous aimes. Vous etes nos soeurs et notres freres premierement.  As an Ontarian who is also a Muslim, I can assure you that the people I know will definitely not be doing this. We know that it's a small faction of idiots trying to divide a country. We love Quebec and we love the people. We are One Canada! 2016: 1      2015: 2     2014: 4     2013: 3     Almost, the last one occurred in july 2015. As someone from Quebec City what happened tonight is just unbelievable I forgot about that one. People can truly be assholes.  Maybe it just cancels out and we can forget all about this? [removed] By addressing our seriously flawed mental health care system. As well as continuing to do community outreach initiatives, funding good schools, and promoting cooperation between police and moderate Muslims to detect extremism at the source.  > Sometimes the individual is mentally ill and not managing their condition correctly is what contributed to their willingness to attack, in which case the whole thing becomes a question of if it's terrorism  I think in this case there is almost no support for mental illness, so it has to be terrorism. That is, if the two suspects are both a part of it. If it's called a team of mentally ill shooting up a mosque, then I'll give up hope. Not that they aren't mentally ill for shooting people in prayer, but that doesn't make it not terrorism since it was coordinated. >How can the government, other then preemptive arrests stop people who are crazy enough to murder other human beings, it's not a rational desire.  To call every murderer crazy or psycho and just ignore actual motives is really not the right thing to do.  Bad people can have clear thoughts too.    Look at all the companies which have gotten away with worse for example. i don't need facts to tell me whoever did it is a fucking asshole.  [removed] Seriously fuck people. Facts aren't even out and people are trying place blame. The phrase ""Allahu Akhbar"" itself is used *many* times, as in up to 20, in prayer as well.  If it was loud enough to be heard it was either an imam or someone leading a group of people praying, or someone (the shooters *or* people getting shot at) yelling it outside of prayer.   It is,  for example,  the sort of thing a devout Muslim might say if they were being shot at  I didn't really notice his accent, honestly? I was still pleasantly surprised I understood most of his interview, given the audio quality. Generally a huge problem in these small artic  communities. It has been discussed in terms of Greenland here in Denmark as well, because weapons (for hunting) are more common up there and with the high rates of suicide and substance abuse it's only a matter of time before someone takes the next step. The increased focus on especially the substance abuse (primarily alcohol) will hopefully get it under control before any such happens. Many more will know his name after he wins a bunch of Oscars for directing Arrival. And I've just learned that he's directing the new Blade Runner! Glad to hear that it's in good hands. We practice lockdown procedures twice a semester/ 4 times a year. We have assemblies each year about procedures and safety precautions. You jinxed us, esti de tabarnaque! > than a week later, this happens  To put it in perspective, it's like a medium-severity car crash. Or less than the amount of people that die in Canada of tobacco-related causes **every hour**.  Imagine there was a terrorist attack like this every hour, day and night, 365 days a year. It would still be only the second cause of (preventable) death in Canada.  But since it's terrorism, we have to feel terrorized, otherwise the terrorists win. Or something like that. Je suppose que tu parle franais.. tu a exactement raison. Il avait une barbe magestique. Il tait souvent a la caisse aussi.  >was such a kind soul  As with 90% of people in general. It's such a shame that so many can be tricked or persuaded into rejecting the inclination to be empathetic. Why do some people think they can end lifes because they want to, why do they do that? As I've read, the guy you're talking about sounds really cool, and now look what happened, jeez. That's the thing with Quebec, you always know someone who knows someone. We're all tightly related like that. People from Montreal make fun of this sometimes but that's actually the charm of our city and what makes this tragedy affect us all so tragically...

They are just kind of stumbling through life following their ""heart"" (emotions and other natural ways of thinking).

Love and compassion should always be on the forefront.  That's still crazy good for a city of half a mil. Halifax here.

Holy shit, did you guys host a Purge in 2014? [removed] Absolutely. Regardless of skin colour or religious beliefs this is a bad person. Let's remember that instead of hating a group of people based on whoever this turns out to be. [removed] [removed] Right.

In case you didn't know, Quebec curses are church words (tabernacle, chalice, christ...) well, they do control much of the hard drug supply in Canada.. Who knew dudes on 2-wheel vehicles could be so controversial  The Quebec construction mafia's scary as fuck too, Quebec has a lot of sinister shit.

It makes me happy that Americans are actually responding to our government by reminding ourselves to be level headed while educating ourselves and to not knee jerk respond to the media. It gives me hope, so thank you for your comment. [removed] Yeah, according to my dad (devout Muslim), when a Muslim dies, they try to make their last words be ""la ilaha illallahu muhammadur-rasurullah"" (there is none to worship except god, and Muhammad is his messenger) - it helps you get to heaven if your last words are a reaffirmation of your faith in god. but if you don't have time to get it all out, ""allahu akbar"" (god is great) would be an acceptable substitute. So it might also be someone who was dying or thought he was dying. So basically this information really leads us nowhere in terms of identifying the reasons behind this attack.  But I guess we'll find out soon enough what the gunman's motives were... Exactly, it's equivalent to yelling ""OMG"" or ""Jesus Christ, please don't kill me!"" before something bad happens. It could have just as easily been a victim yelling in Arabic ""Allahu Akhbar, they have guns and are coming for us!"" and a witness only recognizing the first bit. We may never know the speaker's motives. Or if your a sadistic fuck who decides to shoot up a mosque and you decide to be ironic. Amazing film. Liked Prisoners as well.  ""I suppose you speak French. You are exactly right. He had a majestic beard. He was often at the counter as well."" This is one of the saddest things I've read on Reddit. Two people on the internet connecting over a kind person they mutually knew, who is now dead.    Edit: Someone brought up something important. Not just dead. Murdered. And thats what makes this so much more terrible. A kind and sweet soul was taken from this world before his time was up. /u/_teediz's comment was: ""I suppose you speak French. You're right.

I can honestly say I've never thought of moving to a place directly after a mass shooting till now.  Then you're one of the good ones.  Fuck man, I hear you. I hit New on comments and realized Donald and Politics were deadly in those parts so here I am coming back to rational people. Every comment up here just makes sense as we focus on the real situation. I'm not saying you're wrong by any means, but this is r/worldnews - as a multinational subreddit there is no indication that the people you responded to are even from the US. Cool.  There's a similar thing in judaism where you're supposed to say this prayer before you die:   ""A Song of Ascents. I lift my eyes to the mountains -- from where will my help come? My help will come from the Lord, Maker of heaven and earth. He will not let your foot falter; your guardian does not slumber. Indeed, the Guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps. The Lord is your guardian; the Lord is your protective shade at your right hand. The sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night. The Lord will guard you from all evil; He will guard your soul. The Lord will guard your going and your coming from now and for all time.""  Even though I am not personally religious, I think it's sort of beautiful.  And yeah, I suppose time will tell the motives.   No, it's not used as flippantly as ""omg"". You don't use it as an expression of surprise - it's more akin to ""praise the Lord"" if anything.  Oh cool! Not cool cool, but good to know this info.  I really used to think it was like the militant Muslim equivalent of Banzai or whatever it was the Japanese kamikaze fighters would scream. I'm sorry for my ignorance! I'm a reasonably educated person, just not in Muslim religion.  Yep  Could be them taunting Muslims, could be Muslims saying it before dying, could be because it's a mosque, etc...  Awwwww right in the feels.. For only taking a semester of high school french 10 years ago, I was very proud of how much I was able to get before reading your translation. Got the first two sentences down, maybe I should pick french back up. Not just dead, bud.  Murdered.  For no good reason by some spineless pieces of shit.  RIP man with majestic beard. Right? Just a really personal and real moment.  My condolences for all involved. Hatred is a sickness and love is the medicine.  My eyes filled with tears reading that exchange.

I don't think he's really ""praising the lord"" at this moment.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsprSFu0qOg It actually really bothers me that this phrase is so widely associated with Muslims, and yet so many people just assume it's some sort of war cry. Allahu akbar is literally just Arabic for god is great, and it's a phrase that is repeated multiple times during prayer. It's not some battle yell, it's an expression of devotion to god that perfectly peaceful Muslims repeat every day. And yeah, Muslims use the phrase in other parts of their life as well You should try Duolingo. They recently added a chat bot feature that's cool.

"42",41,"5qxl7f","2017-01-30","So in one week Trump has increased international funding for health clinics, increased international refugee quotas and united Mexico. Thanks Trump. Why would Mexico be expected to pay? This article sums-up all the ridiculousness I've missed.  Enrique isn't very popular either. Not sure what is happening in Mexico, but people need to come to an agreement soon. And still is. I had to write this because no one else did, the media is putting pea nieto in a pedestal here, but that's not at all true, he is fucking up our country, not uniting it, yeah perhaps we don't like Trump but we still don't like pea nieto. Trump is going to remind the rest of the world how little they actually need us. The bump is due to the highly held values of machismo in Mexican culture, and telling off a major world leader who is perceived by Mexicans to be insulting the Mexican nation has earned Nieto major machismo points.  All of those points will disappear if the US stops importing from Mexico in any meaningful way because of these actions, as it will destroy, not hurt, utterly DESTROY the Mexican economy.   The US is responsible for 80% of their export business. They have no other customer that wants to either buy from them in that volume as:   * no one has comparable buying power that has interest in importing cheap labor  * the next two largest buyers are Canada and China, who are responsible for 2.7% and 1.5% of Mexico's export market respectively  Additionally there is no one who will be willing to provide the logistical infrastructure to buy from them as all of Mexico's logistical structure is land based. See, every cloud has a silver lining! Trumps even helping Mexico; ) Trump is the best threat to mankind aside from ill bent aliens invading Earth. GOP and minority politicians have the race card, Hillary has the gender card, and Mexican president has the Trump card I don't understand the main stream media these days. Just a year ago they were accusing Mexico's president of being corrupt and abusing his people. Now they're kissing his behind and making him look like a national hero when his people are starving and risk their lives to cross a border just to work for 6 bucks an hour in the back of a warehouse. Oh well, Its about time a President looks out for his own country, instead of making unfavorable deals.  This is kind of scary because it implies that the same thing can happen in the US with trump. ""Sure he's ruining everything, but he stood up to that one guy that one time! 4 more years."" People are dumb as fuuuuck...ugh... I can't tell if the man is stupid on purpose or stupid and just lucky.  In worldwide politics he is like the gift that keeps on giving. Every leader bad mouths him but deep down they are like ""Thank god for the Trump distraction""  And during every election they will paint their opponents as Trump like. I don't see a change in presidents and prime ministers in any country for the next 4 years. As long as people are dumb enough to worry about what America is doing rather than their own country, politics is going to be real easy  Apparently the ACLU has also seen a rather large spike in donations. Man, lelouch is looking a lot older Quite amazing, actually.  Well on his way to the Peace Prize. >The President is very much a figurehead - he wields no real power whatsoever. He is apparently chosen by the government, but the qualities he is required to display are not those of leadership but those of finely judged outrage. For this reason the President is always a controversial choice, always an infuriating but fascinating character. His job is not to wield power but to draw attention away from it.  >An orange sash is what the President of the Galaxy traditionally wears.  >On those criteria Zaphod Beeblebrox is one of the most successful Presidents the Galaxy has ever had. He spent two of his ten Presidential years in prison for fraud.  -Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy Yes and not to mention that he's fucked world peace.  Making Mexico great again! Making South America Great Again.  Sounds like an anime i once watched I thought they were going to use tariffs on Mexican goods as a way of funding The Wall? In this case US citizens are probably going to be the ones paying.  I dont know if trump stumbled ass backwards into this situation or if he actually studied it in some detail, but mexico is not at all blameless in this situation. Their citizens sneak into our country illegally, and when we try to send them back, mexico makes it very difficult and drags its feet every step of the way. Then when we do send them back, mexico makes no effort to keep them there, and has on some occassions, even encouraged them to sneak into the united states.   So the us goes through the very expensive process of catching these people sneaking illegally into the country, processing them, then deporting them, and after we spend all that money they just try again. At some point, mexicos lack of action makes you exasperated enough to say ""its time you guys actually did something and we are going to make you do it."" If this kicks mexico into high gear and they actually get serious about slowing the flow of illegals from their country into ours, so be it.  These are insane levels of illegal immigrants, no other major country in the world allows over 10 million illegal immigrants to sneak into their country and get away with it. Its actually kind of funny, because after trumps been elected, a lot of these people have been to scared to cross the border, and now mexico is dealing with the very high cost of dealing with this influx of migrants. You cant claim illegals dont cost the US anything, when after a month of them staying in mexico, mexico is suddenly going broke trying to pay for them  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/world/americas/mexico-border-tijuana-migrants-haitians-trump-wall.html Because they have failed to control the territories on our shared border?   This is why Mexico never gets their shit together. Always in-fighting.   Also fuck the PRI I've been to Germany this Christmas. Everyone was rude to me when they heard i was American. Trust me, the world doesn't like us as much as you think. It's all in your head. We don't owe anyone anything. The fact that you genuinely think the world does not need the US just shows how out of touch you are. Read a fucking book instead of constantly parroting what reddit tells you to. Maybe Mexico need to take this opportunity to diversify their Economy to not be so dependent on a volatile America. Nothing to do with machismo, it's national pride. As you said, if the US stops buying from Mexico, that would destroy the Mexican economy. But we prefer that and start all over again rather than be bullied by Trump.    You act as if Machismo is a Mexican thing. It's not. Every country in the world wants to be respected. Russia? Israel? China? The US? Show me any country that likes being bullied around.  Enjoy feeding china all of that import cash and having your primary economic region fall to pieces, while you still are forced to purchase more expensive electronics from Mexico while losing a substantial part of your own consumer market. Mexico is in dire need to redevelop it's economy internally. Mexico can look to Latin America as an emerging consumer market, now that they are a middle income country and can use Central America for cheap labour while they transition to a fully industrial economy. Foreign trade is not the principal way the Mexican economy is sustained. 85% of Mexican companies are owned by our own national capital, our purchasing power parity is good because of low inflation and living costs (in spite of currency devaluation) and we have good trade relations with Europe and China. Sure, the consequences will still be felt greatly, and will be harsher for Mexico than for the USA locally, but globally you are handing the stage over to papa China. The US economy will be substantially hit by widespread tariffs on Mexican imports. The US economy is consumer driven and much of the value of Mexican goods is intrinsically tied to US companies (ownership of factories, value-add in the supply chain, etc.) Mexican here. We have not forgotten or forgiven. Just because he's standing up to him doesn't mean he hasn't done incredibly vile things during his tenure.  Ahh see where you miss the point, the news is just reporting what happened. That's what the news should do - not like those alt-right news websites which is 90% opinion based and 10% alternative facts. Well, you know, he's against Trump and the media are against Trump so you know...the enemy of my enemy is my friend, no matter how bad he is. I'm sure there were socialist people applauding Stalin and Mao in the USA back in the days. You've been duped. I wonder how long it will take you to figure out.  Alienating all of our allies and making deals to the benefit of his companies aren't exactly favorable You are so right. President Nieto has certainly made the right decision for his country as a good president should.  Just a shame that Trumplethinskin isn't looking out for *his* country. To the tune of a lovely $10 million. Nah he's playing 78D Monopoly.  Can't wait till trump's best friend murders him in front of everyone I can't not upvote a Code Geass reference. With him improving ties with Russia, he's a shoe in.  Mexico is north America.  They floated that idea, they have no idea how they are actually going to pay for it, just that ""Mexico will end up paying for it"" And Mexico will place tariffs on US products in kind.  > mexico makes no effort to keep them there,  The countries that actively try to prevent their citizens from leaving are usually called dictatorships or hell-holes. I actually can't name a free country that keeps it's citizens imprisoned; only countries like China, North Korea and East Germany come to mind. How would Mexico keep people who don't want to be there? I mean they can't jail them, or track them at all times. The wall even seems silly because people can cross over its easier to just get a visa or go around in a boat. And I just feel its a waste of tax payer money on both sides. If the USA and Mexico have to work together the best thing to do would be destroy the cartels, their drug trade not only destabilizes Mexico it also destroys USA with their terrible drugs.  Too bad the CIA would be against it since they're the ones who created a bunch of the drug operations and helped sell it on American streets. Alternative facts my friend.  I actually work with DHS and have personally been on the front lines of deporting illegal immigrants from Mexico, Cuba, and even Haiti. All of whom played a major roll in the capture and detainment of said immigrants. You cant expect a non dictatorship country to track the whereabouts of all citizens at all times, you can however enact punishments upon those caught which is precisely what happens in my experience regardless how minor it may seem. Secondly, I can assure you that most illegal immigrants are getting in to this nation by other means than just walking across. This wall serves no purpose but to decrease national relations and increase tax paying dollars.  Essentially accurate. And both parties here in us reject any type of large scale process to get them status.   Maybe a wall is kinder than housing them in prison-like detention centers. https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-01-03/children-fleeing-violence-central-america-who-don-t-make-it-us-often-end-mexican One of the reasons Mexico ""drags its feet"" is because most illegal border crossings are not done by Mexicans, but by central americans If a country has closed borders or restrictive immigration policies, it is the duty of that country to enforce them, not to force its neighbors to execute those policies upon their own soil. Mexico has no say over who enters the United States, so they should not be held accountable for it. Honestly what would you expect them to do? Establish a 'no-man's zone' in the desert and arrest any civilian found loitering near the border? failed? Mexico is not the one wanting to build a wall, and spend billions  Thanks to this crappy corrupted government I've traveled around the world and never had people be rude to me because I am American. Maybe you're just a dick and people were reacting to that? > We don't owe anyone anything.  We kinda owe China a lot of money I think you're owed an English education. So...dont read a book? *Squawk* What Reddit tells you? Last I checked every geopolitical thread on Reddit was filled to the brim with long explanations on how the US is an immovable and essential power in the entire world. They do, but I'm pretty sure it's on a very long list of other things they really *need* to do, and I'd bet it's not near the top. That's easy to say, but I bet you and many others would be singing a different tune if that shit ever actually happened. Mexico's no paradise as it is, but that would literally destroy the country. > Sure, the consequences will still be felt greatly, and will be harsher for Mexico than for the USA locally  Still, thousands of American jobs and businesses would be hurt with a decline in trade with Mexico. Funny how Trump says he is about job creation, yet he is willing to destroy an entire region and industries that depends on trade with Mexico.  I'm honestly not sure if you're beings sarcastic or not.  he knows. deep down... *he knows*.... Favorable to him. His people are starving, walking 200 miles across the desert just for the hope of finding a demeaning slave wage job to feed their family back home... real hero this president is.. Up to $15 mil now.  So a small loan then.  And he's trying to sell you the Russian Avenue as the Boardwalk. Paradox Poker 783D Mahjong. Its south of the bit that Trump is currently fucking up. Compass directions are by definition subject to the position of the compass. Cuba. There's a lot of Cubans in Mexico now because they tried getting to the US right as Obama got rid of the policy that lets them become residents as soon as they get to the US. These Cubans say they can't go back to Cuba because they will be seen as 2nd class citizens who abandoned their country.   Actually, the Mexican government fighting the cartels with deadly force is precisely what destabilized security in most of the country. Incidentally, Mexican immigration has been steadily declining and is now at an all time low, all the while each year more people are murdered that last year in Mexico by organized crime.  WRONG!! trump want to show the chinese that he make the best wall. Of course, youve got a friend, how dare i bring sourced arguments to this, when youve got a friend in the dhs. All the proof i need :)  Mexico has handed out pamhplets at border towns explaining how to illegally sneak into the US, they arent exactly discouraging it. They like unloading their rapists, drug dealers, and scum onto the US Mexico doesn't control its own territory, which is the problem.    I would honestly expect them to exercise sovereignty over their legal land. I don't think a wall is the answer, but, I am amazed the US and Mexico have tolerated cartel activity for as long as they have.  Mexico has non-state actors that effectively control portions of the border. Their failure to control their own territory as a sovereign has negatively impacted the United States.   Historically, this would be addressed through military action.  Yeah, sounds like a dick. Pretty much, I've met loads of Americans in Scotland and the only ones that I was a dick to were the ones that were acting like cunts. I don't give a fuck if Trump is President or if Bush invaded Iraq it's not like you personally did it but if you go around with an attitude of superiority you'll get taken down a peg pretty quickly. me too except when I was in Denmark during Bush jr... several 18-24 year olds were very rude to me I'm guessing you did that before Trump was president. I'm the nicest person in the world    60% of US debt is owed by Americans. China isn't even the largest holder of foreign debt, that would be Japan. Even if the ""debt"" worked like people pretend it does (hint: it's not an 'iou' they can just call in at any moment), China liquidating all of its holdings would only be a short term hit, the US Credit markets would be strong enough to absorb the impact.  Every time someone fear mongers about Chinese-U.S. debt holding, it's always total bullshit. China *bought treasury notes*  they invested in bonds  yes that money needs to pay back eventually but its not like we borrowed it the way you borrow money from a bank or something. Do you mean an education in the English language or an English education? Due to your poor grammar I can't tell which you mean.  No no no, don't do what the *rest* of reddit tells you. Do what *he* tells you, for his is The Truth. What a humble person, offering such treasured information with merely a single insult. Why would you try to lie to me about something so obvious to disprove? The entirety of reddit is currently shitting on the US and declaring it no longer a super power.  The delusion is strong with you I guess. And paying $25 Billion for a wall wouldn't destroy the country?   The article isn't praising him. It even says in the title, he was once hated and now he is praised. They are reporting what happened - you don't see anywhere stating that ""It is our opinion at Associated Press that this guy is good"". If trump suddenly got a 80% approval rating they would say the same. If you don't agree tell me why. Of course you aren't. Exactly.  What is good for the country is irrelevant to him.  So you think Nieto *should* make his nation pay for Trumps pointless wall?  Also your word painting of a 3rd world nation migrating across borders to stave off starvation is a tiny bit out of date since for the last decade and a bit [the flow is in the other direction.](http://www.pewhispanic.org/2015/11/19/more-mexicans-leaving-than-coming-to-the-u-s/)  Never mind. This is all fakenews right? This the new world where the Pew Research Center is full of left wing liars as well right? Are you posting from 1992? Keep it coming, people. They have an excellent track record. And protests are great, but money talks. Up to $24 mil  24 small loans, or 12 medium sized loans. Would you like to super size that loan?  Making *southern* North America great again? Lol. A wall like that would be a site to see I cannot deny that. > Mexico has handed out pamhplets at border towns explaining how to illegally sneak into the US, they arent exactly discouraging it  That was [debunked](http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2010/may/29/lamar-smith/smith-says-mexico-hands-out-brochures-showing-migr/) awhile back.  No not a friend. ME. I work directly in the Department of Homeland Security. (Not sure where the confusion is there) I'm not arguing your article you linked which states issues for Mexico, I am arguing your statement that none of these countries put forth any effort towards the fight against illegal immigration.   I cant even believe I am having this conversation right now. You have the internet, you have the knowledge of the world at your fingertips. I implore you to use it. Educate yourself, educate others. Don't just stop at Trump's promises. Don't stop at fox news. Do collective research. Read multiple sources. Fact check those sources. Do yourself a favor and avoid the increase of fake news and blind ignorance.  Please and thank you. Are you laboring under the impression that the Mexican government has been taking no steps to fight the cartels, and that if it weren't for the cartels the Mexican government would prevent its citizens from trying to enter the United States? Because if not, I don't see how your point applies to the topic of why Mexico should be forced to pay the cost of enforcing United States immigration policy. So, you want a war now?  Look, it's our wall.  If we want it, we pay for it.  That's like saying all the beer commercials made me drink, so beer companies should pick up my bar tab. Canadian here. I've run into two types of Americans in my life: decent people, and people who exemplify why the rest of the world thinks Americans are useless cunts.   It's been about 50-50 so far. >if you go around with an attitude of superiority you'll get taken down a peg pretty quickly.  Never understood that. It's fine to think your country is better than others, in my opinion. The rub occurs when you think any of that would make you an inherently better person that a person from another country. It's especially dumb when Americans do it, since ""all men are created equal"" and all that jazz.  Now before I get torn to shreds, I simply feel nationalism isn't inherently bad, it's when people start thinking they themselves are superior to those from other countries because of it that things go wrong. That NEVER ends well, no matter what caused that sense of superiority. And unfortunately we have several cases in history where nationalism has been the catalyst for these feelings.  Quick edit: In case it's not clear, I agree with you that many Americans carry such shitty attitudes and deserved to be treated appropriately. I don't think they were rude to you because bush Jr. was president I see thats enlightening He meant like tea and biscuits English To be fair, I can click on the comment sections of one article and see gloom and doom and I can do the same for another and see the absolute opposite.  Yeah, reddit has a strong liberal bias, but it's not like as if there are zero conservatives or otherwise Trump supporters around. It tends to get jerky (in either direction) depending on which comments exactly get voted up first from what I've been reading over this past week. The wall is a retarded idea and a massive waste but 25b in spending is a drop in the bucket for the USA. Do you seriously think that could destroy the richest country in the world? >Pointless wall   Cartels cross it on a daily basis delivering nice things like drugs and assault rifles   >Nieto shouldn't pay for the wall   They do almost nothing to stop drugs, weapons, and their own criminals from crossing into the U.S. In many cases politicians even work with cartels or look the other way in exchange for a large amount of cash   >Mexicans leaving the U.S.   Considering the US has almost 12 million LEGAL Mexican IMMigrants and another 10 million (estimated) ILLEGAL Mexican MIgrants, which is 10 to 20 percent of the entire population of Mexico (120 million), it's not impossible to have more Mexican-Americans leave the US than legal Mexican immigrants coming into it.    Your understanding of fake news is strange.   Fake news is something like..CNN stating wikileaks documents are illegal to look at No, some Mexicans literally starve in Mexico. They literally come here and become modern slaves. Go there and see how great it is and tell me about it later. ""It warns migrants of the perils of crossing over. For instance, they are told that crossing the river -- unnamed in the brochure, but presumably the Rio Grande -- can be perilous and that wet, heavy clothing makes floating or swimming difficult. For desert crossers, this section advises migrants ""to walk during hours when the heat is not too intense.""""  so in there attempt to debunk it, they literally proved that mexico was advising people on the proper safe way to illegally cross the border. Mexico shouldnt be worried about its citizens safely making it to the US, if they drown in the rio grande that means they didnt make it here I was referring to you, an anonymous friend who works in the DHS.  Mexico doesnt need to 'track the wherabouts of all citizens at all times', they are much to lazy and incompetent to pull that off. But they do need to start making an effort to keep their citizens in their country and out of ours.   > I cant even believe I am having this conversation right now. You have the internet, you have the knowledge of the world at your fingertips. I implore you to use it. Educate yourself, educate others. Don't just stop at Trump's promises. Don't stop at fox news. Do collective research. Read multiple sources. Fact check those sources. Do yourself a favor and avoid the increase of fake news and blind ignorance.  The irony of that statement is hilarious. The US has 11 million illegals living in this country, far more than any other nation on earth would ever put up with, and yet expecting action on this issue makes you uneducated. Mexico trying to deal with a fraction of the illegals we put up with is straining local governments to their absolute limit, yet we are supposed to pretend they arent motivated to unload those people onto us. If the threat of paying for a 15 billion dollar wall is what forces mexico to act, then so be it. E-visa tracking system for the rest.   Face it, when it comes to needing to educate yourself and others, youre the one who wants to live with your head in the ground.  > Are you laboring under the impression that the Mexican government has been taking no steps to fight the cartels  That they have not taken adequate steps...Which is self-evident.  > and that if it weren't for the cartels the Mexican government would prevent its citizens from trying to enter the United States  The Mexican government can't set the policy as it stands...As they lack sovereign control over these areas.   > Because if not, I don't see how your point applies to the topic of why Mexico should be forced to pay the cost of enforcing United States immigration policy.  The wall is also aimed at curtailing cartel activity, which includes human smuggling.  It would be like if I kept delivering a bunch of beer to your house that you didn't want. > It's been about 50-50 so far.  I can say the same about Canadians. You guys are America-lite.  They were. The president represents the US people.  Reddit's entire voting system is a popularity contest. I'm talking about Mexico >Cartels cross it on a daily basis delivering nice things like drugs and assault rifles  Actually they drive right through the checkpoints on the bits that already have massive fences in legal trucks paying bribes to custom officials, they use narco-catapults and airplanes, narco-subs and boats. The people crossing on foot over the open desert are not taking high value cargoes with them. So yup, quite pointless.  Your second point about they do nothing to stop drugs has no apparent connection to wether or not Mexico should pay for a wall with no point to it, Especially for the Mexican government.  The drug trade is largely a creation of US drug policy. Prohibition never worked for alcohol and its never worked for drugs. With the exception of course of drug dealers, anti drug militias and legal pharmaceutical companies. Legalise it all and the narco barons go broke the next day.  And the reason I raised the prospect of calling Pew Research Center fake news is because Trump on TV accused the 'reporter' (author of a Pew Report on the total lack of evidence of voter fraud) of 'grovelling'. [He genuinely seemed to think the Pew Research Center is some kind of news agency.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/01/25/trumps-absurd-claim-the-2012-pew-report-researcher-was-groveling/?utm_term=.68e4cc22e43e)  And also CNN getting things wrong is not 'fake news'. 'Fake news' is fake news sites hosting entirely fabricated stories for the express purpose of muddying the already murky waters of partisan media. Buzzfeed publishing the Trump dossier knowing full well it could never be corroborated was BAD journalism. Breitbart publishing any of its horribly written pieces defending Trump with poor arguments is BAD journalism. Fox asking softball questions and CNN concentrating on pussy grabbing months later are both biased journalism. 'Fake news' is a real thing with a real definition. I've been there.  Numerous times.  Never saw anyone starving.  If anything I usually ate too much when I was there. You are a nasty human being.  First off I would request dependable sources on your opinions in this matter. Second, again, im not saying we don't have a problem with illegal immigration. Im not saying that we (US and other countries) couldn't do more to help the situation. You keep changing the argument and making up your own intent of my meaning. That isn't irony, that's misdirection. You claimed their government is actually trying to send illegal immigrants to us without any facts to back it up. Im simply stating I have witnessed first hand the actions of these countries and their efforts to prevent them no matter how small the efforts may seem they still cost their government time and money to do so. Stop spreading your bull shit conspiracy propaganda and just stick with the facts. Until you actually supply us with CREDIBLE sources, I am simply forced to end this useless conversation and avoid your rants.  Those are non-answers. Organized crime very, *very* far from the simple cut and dry situation you seem to be suggesting it is. [Here's a relevant wikipedia article.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Drug_War)  Just about the only way I could think for your apparent goals to be achieved would be if Mexico became a police state and started enforcing the laws of the United States upon its own citizens, which would likely spark a civil war. reading your comments have disappointed me and lowered my hopes for the american people. Well, when you put it that way, that sounds awesome.  Get a taco truck around my corner and I'm set for life. Won't deny that. Just look at Harper. *shudders* Paying 25b up front for a useless wall would fuck Mexico  ""Paying"" 25b over time in various means such as tariffs/reduction in aid is also terrible for them and pointless for us, but it's better than the alternative which is basically economic suicide.  Unfortunately that's the shit that happens when you have an ultra sensitive manchild as the most powerful man in the world Also to remember that the Mexican government has gotten 100 out of the 122 most wanted cartel leaders in the US in the last 10 years, plus they have worked with the American government under the Mrida initiative.  Mexico has even catched ISIS militants for the US and helped to catch Gaddafi's family as they fled.  Mexico is fighting a drug war for American interests and because of American demand, this war has had over 100000 deaths. I guess that counts for something >Actually   >So yup, quite pointless   Jeez can you sound more leftie?   >CNN not fake news   There are literally countless examples of fabrications and incorrect facts.  And you are a heartless monster who wants innocent mexicans to be forced into slave labor in a foreign country so you can have cheaper potatoes You may disagree with my answers (and reality) but they are answers nonetheless.  And they can and have undertaken military action against the cartels. They need to clear out corruption within there government. Yeah and what's the rest of the world doing by not standing up for themselves? Trumps gotten his way all his life. It's about time someone did something about it  Their* . Mexico has actively taken military measures against cartels, as can be seen by the reduced murder rate.  Mexicans always mark the economy and unemployment as the things that worry them the most. If Trump messes NAFTA, even if the wall stops drug flows ( ignoring the evidence of boats and submarines that have been found, as well as the dozens of US border agents bribed), immigration will only increase to the US because people are not running from the violence, they are running for better jobs. Your wild conjecture about geopolitics and reality seem to not have terribly much in common. You stated an answer to a question, I challenged it, and you have evaded.  Why should Mexico pay for a wall that is intended to enforce the United States' immigration policies on the United States? Why is it Mexico's problem that people want to enter the US? How strictly do you think the Mexican Government should control the movements of Mexican civilians so as to comply with US domestic policy?  Saying ""They don't have control of their territory"" (because of cartels that are as powerful as they are largely due to the war on drugs and other US policies) doesn't answer any of those. Thanks for the correction...That wasn't a typo I never learned the difference.   In any event, you are getting off topic. I answered that question already...  They should pay for it because they have failed to exercise sovereignty over their own country. That is their responsibility as a nation-state. You may disagree, but, that is the answer.

We can take in some and feel good about ourselves, but it's a drop in the bucket compared to the totality of oppression, violence and hunger billions in this world experience. What's the spin on how this is terrible and Hitler did the same thing? What happens if objectively good things happen economically and in the Middle East under Trump? ISIS will soon lose all their territory and economic growth looks positive. He'll be able to stamp his name to some of this, as he'll be fighting ISIS more aggressively while they're already on the way out. I just came here to hear how this makes Trump literally Hitler. >petition to ban trump from state talks in the uk  Has over 55k upbotes and rising.  >trump helps create safe havens for endangered people in their own country  Less than 500.   Reddit is 90% liberal propoganda, 10% substance. This safe zone idea is not new was mooted by Turkey, EU and US in Syria, but there is a lot of complications.   US and EU wants safe zones free of ISIS, Turkey wants them free of Kurds, Kurds want them free of Turkmen militias, Syria wants them free of all foreign countries, Iran/Iraq wants them free of Saudi block.  Any western troops on the ground will have a severe backlash and rise of terrorism, So what troops are going to be protecting safe zones? Who is going to pay for it?  Asking Saudi to create or monitor or protect safe zones is like asking the wolf to guard the sheep, major sponsor of ISIS was Saudi and Qatar. But america wants to gloss that over about their closest allies. In a war, there are no safe zones. It is my experience that every civil war, sooner or later, engulfs all parts of a country. What seems like a very safe haven today, might become the hot spot of tomorrow. This makes it almost impossible to find a location for a safe zone.  Many people have objected that such plans would lead to another big US military involvement in an already messy war and I agree, but there are many more things to consider:  Military problems.  In the age of modern warfare a static defense (for example of a safe haven) is every commanders worst nightmare. It takes much more troops to defend a safe zone than it would take to protect a military airport or a big army base: while you might eventually withdraw from a military base, you cant do that with a safe zone. Abandoning civilians that you have pledged to protect will create a humanitarian disaster or even the blueprint for a big massacre.  Planning .  The creation of safe zones requires planning. At this moment the US have only a few Special Operations Forces on the ground in Syria who are not trained to look out for suitable safe zone locations. It would be necessary to send several advance teams with engineers and humanitarian relief specialists and this will cost time and resources. And its as good as impossible that such a task could be completed in 90 days, like it is proposed in the recently published draft text of a presidential executive order.  There is a war going on in Syria; no way that some planners from the Pentagon would be able to roam around the country looking for suitable spots for their safe zones. And who says that such locations even exist?  It might be very well possible that such a planning mission will return with the message: no suitable location found.  Civil- Military Cooperation.  The military cannot run refugee camps or safe zones, this is the job for a civil organization. The only organization that is capable of managing a massive humanitarian relief mission, involving thousands of refugees, is the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), a United Nations organization. Taking into account Mr. Trumps plans to cut funding for the UN, it is hardly imaginable how a cooperation between the US military and the UN could possibly work.  Costs.  It is said that for every soldier that is deployed in a war zone, another fifteen at home are necessary to provide logistics and support. If you plan to send in only a light division (1015,000 soldiers), roughly 185,000 personnel would be involved in the operation, not counting civilians.  It would be much cheaper to support the already existing refugee camps in Turkey or Jordan and even flying out every single Syrian refugee to the United States would be a bargain in comparison to the implementation of safe zones.  Surprisingly, the biggest problem might be to find enough refugees who are willing to stay in their war torn country and entrust their lives to an American military mission. Most Syrians have completely lost their trust in the International community, including the United States. They also dont trust their fellow countrymen and are not inclined to displace themselves inside of Syrias territory:  Remember, there is a war going on! Trump opens concentration camps for Refugees""- CNN The US, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey armed and financed ISIS as a weapon to unleash on Syria, which was an ally of Iran that refused to take orders from the Western powers. The west bears heavy responsibility for the deaths of 450,000 Syrians, at least half the nation of 23 million becoming refugees, and destruction of this once lovely country.  At some point, ISIS shook off its western tutors and literally ran amok. But the US has not yet made a concerted attempt to crush ISIS because of its continuing usefulness in Syria and in the US, where ISIS has become the favorite whipping boy of politicians.   Next come the Kurds, an ancient Indo-European stateless people spread across Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria. They have been denied a national state by the western powers since WWI. Kurdish rebels in Iraq have been armed and financed by Israel since the 1970s.  more  http://ericmargolis.com/2016/09/pentagon-and-cia-at-war-in-syria/ [Tragic irony: 15 years after 9/11, US partnering with Al-Qaeda in Syria](https://www.rt.com/op-edge/359180-syria-russia-us-ceasefire-911/)  Russia once exclaimed the same people responsible for 911 were responsible for Syria. Where was Trump on 911? Which side of history will Trump be on?  The key to Syria is to separate the ""moderate"" opposition from the radical groups, which Saudi, Qatar, etc. funds. If Trump fails to recognize this problem, he will be on the wrong footing from the start.   America must establish the terrorist groups, find their supporters and ISIS, etc. will collapse. If Trump collaborates with the funders of these groups, his approach will be flawed. Hopefully it will save lives.  This comment section is frighteningly hostile.  Sounds like Palestine II... man, US politics is really hard to get a firm grip on. NEAT! WAR!  Does anyone oppose this? Seems like a great idea. Why isn't this getting more attention?

Wasn't Hillary going to provoke WW3 for doing exactly this? Implementing safe zones will be a nightmare of the U.S. men and women in uniform who will be stuck guarding them. Mark my words... >They also agreed on the need to address ""Iran's destabilizing regional activities,"" the statement said.  Said between the president of a country who invaded 2 countries in the region, bombs another 2 and arms millitants in 3, and the dictator of a country who invaded and bombed one, spreads salafism to all arab countries, and financially and materially supports millitants and extremists in at least 4.  The news these days feels like taking crazy pills. Do the Saudis have a word in Syria?   Are the russians still against no fly zones? Are save zones no fly zones anyway? Guess they should.  Did Assad really have a stroke? Would this effect the situation?  Anyways, good news I suppose.  Are safe zones like no fly zones on the ground?  Safe zones?  The UN has those in South Sudan.  People are raped 2km from the fence or when they leave to get firewood.  It's a nice idea but it is going to be very expensive and hard to implement. Someone enlighten me as to why Saudi's aren't on the banned list of Muslim countries when they breed [extreme terrorism](http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/25/14383316/trump-muslim-ban-immigration-visas-terrorism-executive-order) themselves.  I'm all for it as long as the Saudi's aren't practicing deception. I thing it's called taqueria ; ). My guess is it's taqueria. The Saudi king, or U.S. president, or any other foreign power have no business deciding what is a ""safe zone"" in Syria.  The job of running the country is for President Assad and his government only.  If his country is allied with another nation, they may request help in order to fight terrorism and protect citizens.    The SAA (Syrian Arab Army) is comprised of Syrians, and they should be the ones receiving support to reestablish security and control of territory.  This is what the vast majority of Syrians would tell you if they were able to have their voices heard.  Most people there don't want either a.) continual terrorism, war, and instability or b.) a Salafist government.  Syria prior to 2011 wasn't perfect but it was stable, safe, and secular.  Libya and Iraq both serve as glaringly obvious recent examples of the lie that is being sold.   Reddit right now: ""oh come on, I hate safe zones"" [removed] It could lead to escalation and will likely require more US ground troops. Who knows what's going on in Trump's mind but it's quite possible this will backfire poorly If you think that saudi able to have a foothold to gain and/or hold what little of their hegemony in Yemen, a good thing.  Sure    Edit: The UN now regards Saudi strike on Yemen, a war crime. I doubt it will happen I can't imagine the houthis trusting or respecting a safe zone. And I can easily see Saudis bombing the safe zone. Neither side can be trusted here. Russia told trump you better think very very carefully before you set up safe zones so I would have to think we will not do anything to upset russia. This safe zone idea is not new was mooted by Turkey, EU and US in Syria, but there is a lot of complications.  US and EU wants safe zones free of ISIS, Turkey wants them free of Kurds, Kurds want them free of Turkmen militias, Syria wants them free of all foreign countries, Iran/Iraq wants them free of Saudi block.

Unless the safe zones are in Syria, that would start WW 3 /s  Edit holy shit people , Russia and the US don't want WW 3. Stop believing RT propaganda. They both have nukes , they won't fight each other directly in a war. And if they do, it's probably for a bigger reason than that.   In 2015, Turkey (one of the US biggest allies in the region )  shot down a Russian jet and that didn't start a war.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Russian_Sukhoi_Su-24_shootdown  Also make sure that schools and hospitals are rebuilt and stay safe. I don't want refugees flooding the US but I also want them to get help. Restoring their country and help undo the mess we created would be better.   I don't trust the Sauds though. No doubt they'll try and implement their own Sunni/Wahhabism crap into the population. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-turkey-usa-idUSKCN0QG1UG20150811  This safe zone idea is not new was mooted by Turkey, EU and US in Syria, but there is a lot of complications.

Nothing in the middle east is black and white. So, how are these 'safe zones' meant to be established and who is going to staff and maintain them? Yeah, it was Hillary's idea during the campaign.  One which Trump supporters claimed was going to start WW3. Yes, and actually, if the people truly cared about them(and not because they just want to feel good about themselves being good people), they'd realize that its much better to take care of them over there because of the lower prices.   Lower prices = more bang for buck = more people saved compared to the high cost to take care of them in first world countries. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-turkey-usa-idUSKCN0QG1UG20150811  Safe zone if created who is going to monitor? Who is going to guard it? Who is going to be allowed in the safe zone? Omg!  Trump and Saudi Arabia have negotiated to ""concentrate"" the refugees into camps where they will be ""taken care of""!!!  Literally Hitler! Congratulations, Trump did it. He did things that weren't absolutely fucking horrendous on a historical scale.  Can we not do this? Can we not normalize Trump? Can we not just forget about the fucking abominable things he's doing just because he didn't personally slit the throat of a Syrian refugee?   Yes, this is good.  No, this doesn't even BEGIN to tip the scales back into the realm of ""Trump isn't fucking horrible"". That happened during the campaign, when it was Hillary putting forth this idea. Then Reddit will love ISIS? Fuck if anyone knows. The flip flop among the people who hate politicians who flip flop is real. Reddit loves whatever opposes Trump, I wouldn't be surprised if people cheer for terrorists just to make Trump look bad Trump opens concentration camps for Refugees""- CNN  It's /r/worldnews. This place is crawling with Stormfront types, so don't hold your breath.  Also, just because he does so many shitty things that it's a chore just to list all of them doesn't magically mean that the criticism is disingenuous or hyperbole. One good thing in 8 horrible days. is it weird that I thought I was on the_donald when I saw the post? Who gives a fuck?  At the end of the day Trump will be getting shit done and crybabies can cry and achieve little to nothing like they always do.  Idgaf about karma. He is getting shit done and Reddit is irrelevant. I guess the ""Saudi"" in the title has some angle to it. The amount of front page posts The Independent has is worrying even me. And I always try to look at both sides, but in the last few weeks I had to look at T_D and worldnews as two contradicting sides, shouldn't worldnews be the neutral one? better than nothing m8 I had to scroll a helluva long way down to find a well reasoned response. didn't trump just sign an EO calling for a comprehensive plan to ""crush"" ISIS to be received within 30 days?   You dont build hotels in warzones you fucking idiot. Or places under sanctions. The original opposition is now in the SDF, fled Syria, or dead. Some may litter about with other more extreme groups.   Trump's best bet to stabilize the region is through mediating between Assad and the house of Saud. My bet is Assad getting full autonomy of Syria in exchange for resources in Golan heights (Israel interest) and the pipeline (Saud/Qatar interest).   Hopefully it will wake a few people up from the illusion that this war is about Democracy. She wanted a no-fly zone, it's unclear where the ""safe zones"" will be and how that differs from refugee camps. Time will tell. She wanted no fly zones which would have started WW3. The problem was Hillary's no fly zones, that she wanted to impose without Russian support. Clinton wanted them in Syria. These safe zones are in Yemen and Oman.  as a marine, we generally accept that wherever we are sent there will be some hostility. In fact, it would be a breath of fresh air feeling good about what we're doing. Say what you want about our conflicts over the last decade but a lot of us felt our justification was a bit murky at best. I for one would feel good about finally using our skills in a more defined mission to help people and bring some discontent to a more defined enemy. I know many of my fellow marines and soldiers share that sentiment.  edit: made it sound less prickish. Unless Trump uses the leverage of reducing funding to UN for the UN to protect these safe zones.  If you have better ideas for protecting masses of people efficiently you will be upgraded to armchair general  >Are save zones no fly zones anyway?  No No fly zones benefit terrorists by shooting down Russian or Syrian planes. A safe zone would be the powers cooperating to establish a civilian living area on the ground No, they're places where we have to send troops so they can be killed by Wahhabis.  Becuase Obama didnt see them that way, this ban goes off of Obamas list of terror prone countries. In addition to what Shill01228 said, because they'd be more useful in other ways, like this safe zone we're talking about.      Adding SA to that list would be squandering whatever leverage the simple unspoken 'threat' of it would have served.  I'm sure the 'list' had at least *some* influence in the safe-zone negotiations.  And I'm sure that it was no mere happenstance that 'the list' came out before these negotiations.   Reddit right now: ""wtf i hate safezones now""  Well yeah  Trump supporters campaigned for months against them [removed] Yes, tell me more why I should believe YOU more than the President of the United States. The Chairman of the Joint Cheif of Staff is still Gen. Dunford. Yeah because offering to fight Saudi wars for them is real tough sell.   So how is the negotiation going? While we're negotiating with Saudi Arabia, why aren't we doing same with Iran? Oh that's right. One buys billions of dollars worth of weapons from the U.S and the other basically thumbs their nose at the U.S. Both are equally brutal and have a history of sponsoring terrorism. Guess which one gets a pass while being allowed to negotiate with Trump? ""Probably"".  I hear that word an awful lot when we talk about Trump. Yup. The art of the deal folks. gee, I remember when Trump supporters on reddit where yelling about how Hillary was bought and paid for by the Saudis, and Trump recognized them as a terrorist threat. He didn't touch the ban list, he increased existing restrictions  So you negotiate with terrorists now. Okay just making it clear. Clinton's no fly zones in Syria would have started WW3.  These safe zones, if supported by both Saudi Arabia and Russia, will probably work. Muslim here and the problem is a anyone smart ends up seeing the bigotry here and leaves. They run the fuck out of here and slowly get their family out  Or who is going to be given safety. This the primary reason why negotions on safe zone broke down in 2015.  http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-turkey-usa-idUSKCN0QG1UG20150811  I bet those little details may have come up during the call. She called for no fly-zones alongside expanding the refugee program.....Not the same thing.  Edit:  >Hillary Clinton forcefully defended her support for a no-fly zone in Syria at the third presidential debate on Wednesday night.   >It was the first time she was pressed by a debate moderator about risks the controversial policy would pose. The moderator, Fox News Chris Wallace, asked Clinton to explain how she would avoid getting into a larger war with either Russia or Syria. He noted that President Barack Obama has cited fears of escalation in rejecting the idea. Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has raised similar concerns, Wallace said.   >If you impose a no-fly zone, how do you respond to their concerns? Wallace asked. Secondly, if you impose a no-fly zone and a Russian plane violates that, does President Clinton shoot that plane down?   >Clinton stuck to an argument she has made many times: Creating an area where Syrian and Russian planes cannot fly would give the U.S. leverage over Syria and Russia to negotiate a political resolution.   >Clinton did not directly answer how she would react if a Russian plane breached a no-fly zone established by the U.S. Nor did Clinton address the Syrian casualties that might result from a no-fly zone. In a 2013 speech to Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs, Clinton told attendees that establishing a no-fly zone would kill a lot of Syrians, because it would require the U.S. to take out Syrian air defenses, which are located in populous areas.   http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_58084280e4b0180a36e91a53       >  they'd realize that its much better to take care of them over there because of the lower prices.  What the fuck are you talking about? How on God's green Earth is it cheaper to sustain a large military presence in multiple foreign countries WHILE importing aid? This is NOT the cheap option. Just look at some comments a little higher up. We're now ""negotiating with terrorists"".  This sounds good but I'd like to see it in practice.  Look, i think trump is an egotistical man child, unprepared for POTUS, but what exactly has he done that makes him hitler 2.0?  He did away with the TPP and now this , both good.  Temporary travel ban, bad; but if thats the worst thing he does to those 7 countries, i'd say its a huge step in the right direction for the US (as opposed to the status quo which is dropping ~21,000 bombs on them per year [or ~2 per hour]).   Trump floated the idea of safe zones in Syria as early as October 2015, which was well before Hillary did.   http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/trump-refugees-create-safe-zone-syria-dont-destroy-all-europe   http://www.today.com/news/donald-trump-calls-syrian-safe-zone-says-refugees-shouldnt-come-t52136    >What I like is build a safe zone, its here, build a big beautiful safe zone and you have whatever it is so people can live, and theyll be happier,   > \- Trump November 16 2015 Trump's shown he's willing to work *with* Russia from the start so this is unlikely to cause any issues. Clinton was fairly hostile towards Russia and the whole thing came off as more of a land grab. [removed] Saudi Arabia taking in refuges that are culturally similar and geographically closer is not an idea exclusive to Hillary Clinton's failed billion dollar campaign.  I can't wait to hear how this is a bad thing though, I'll get CTR a few hours for their marching orders. You mad she wanted to put up a no Fly zone in Syria that could have started a war with Russia. The USA cant put up a no fly zone with out UN agreeing with it. Russia would Veto it. Maybe look into the facts before you spread misinformation   WTF I love TPP now Calling him Hitler is definitively hyperbolic speech. Only one good thing? Seriously... I'm not even a Trump supporter but he's done more good than just this. #MAGA i'm just pointing out that reddit is a literal echo chamber for retarded liberals who think posting here makes a difference.  It's probably why they're losing SO FUCKING HARD. > Reddit is irrelevant  But Bernie can still win this right? I just need to match some more donations Head on over to /r/politics if you want to see a REAL contradicting side. The destabilization of Syria by the US has been going on for fifty years.  It wasnt just Obama, it was a bipartisan effort that took advantage of the arab spring to start a civil war.   That may, or may not be true (the EO).  Wiping out ISIS (if even doable within 5 years) would not solve the problem as many of the other factions would replace them.  There is only one option, okay 2, but for the West to remove themselves from the Middle East and let them fight it out amongst themselves or decimate each country out of existence. > Or places under sanctions.  Oh yeah?    http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/11/politics/trump-ties-with-russia/   Last time I checked, U.S has sanctions on Russia.  Iran is a warzone?  >Or places under sanctions.  That explains why the Trump organization ""didn't"" violate the Cuban sanctions, huh? Safe zones almost implies no fly  And what are safe zones? Nope.  Just another lie spun by Trump supporters.  >This would not be done just on the first day. This would take a lot of negotiation. It would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground.   If you even bothered to read the title you would know they're talking about Syria and Yemen.  And Oman? What is happening in Oman that requires safe zones? This has nothing to with honoring or respecting the armed forced. I don't think anyone wants to send our men and women into Syria right now.  Or you know, he could propose that to the UN instead of trying to extort them. Yeah. Good luck having the US impose safe zones and any UN member state volunteering to be cannon fodder for that hot mess.  Also I'm glad Saudi Arabia is ok for a ""safe zone"" to be established. Considering they are not allies with Syria (In fact far from it considering their proxy war with Iran in Syria isn't going well), nor have they committed any troops to any country besides their puppet state, Bahrain; I'm sure they will be the first to send men to protect the safe zones.  Things for me to strive for. False. Saudi Troops are responsible for their safe zones  .... and against logic? This doesn't make sense What? Trump has been saying he wants the gulf states to pay for safe zones for over a year now. This is exactly what Trump said he was gonna do.  You are confusing safe zone with Hillary's no fly zone. And he is no longer allowed to sit in meetings.  The negotiation's evidently going great. I don't know if you've seen but they've agreed to help create safe zones for refugees in Yemen and Syria.  Well the Saudi's are easily controllable and the Iranians used to be, Iran's only problem in US eyes is that they are not controllable anymore. The Saudi's do a lot for the US, the weapon sales are good but are pretty small compared to the benefit the US gets from the Saudi's selling their oil in dollars and pretty much every single time the US has asked them for something they have agreed (Terrorist information, let us use your country to stage the gulf war, Iraq war, help us get Egypt to leave Israel alone etc.). Terrorists do extend from their extreme ideology but that is just an after effect that they say they can not control outside of their country, but inside their country their ideology does in fact help them stay in power. Plus the US does not care about democracy because in case you didn't know the US loves them some dictators who will kiss their butt, just look at what Kissinger did. His supporters don't realise it yet, but Trump is a whore for Saudi Arabia just like almost every other politician. Probably because Saudi Arabia is the one bombing the shit out of Yemen.   He shouldn't have used it at all. There's no way this came out of thin air, it was **definitely** being negotiated.  You are being islamophobic, miss. Russia and the US don't want WW 3. Stop believing RT propaganda. They both have nukes , they won't fight each other directly in a war. And if they do, it's probably for a bigger reason than that.  In 2015, Turkey (one of the US biggest allies in the region ) shot down a Russian jet and that didn't start a war.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Russian_Sukhoi_Su-24_shootdown   >This would not be done just on the first day. This would take a lot of negotiation. It would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground.  -Clinton talking about no-fly zones  Yeah, her safe zone plan, which involved negotiating with Russia, would have sparked WW3. But Trump's safe zone plan, which involves neogtiating with Russia, is totally different.   >bigotry here   Lol oh brother Plaxma got served >She called for no fly-zones alongside expanding the refugee program.....Not the same thing.   How are they different? I was referring to housing them there, with food and all that available.  It costs so much more to house them in a first world western community with a higher cost of living compared to the average middle eastern country.  http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/syrian-refugees-will-cost-ten-times-more-to-care-for-in-europe-than-in-neighboring-countries-a6928676.html  Here's a relevant article, it shows that it costs 10 times as much to care for in Europe compared to neighboring countries. Which is more humane, caring for 10 refugees or 1? The difference is that one of it is something you can immediately see and feel good about, while the other is much more effective from a humane perspective.  Hope that helps your rustled feels. Was there ever a question on that? No matter where you stand on the issue of the President, we all know The House of Saud supports terrorism.  >Trumpers would rather victim play and bully anyone who disagrees than take a nuanced view of Dear Leader's actions.  I'm surprised you can say that with a straight face. I'm not American and don't support Trump. But Victim play and Bullying is what got Trump elected because people were scared to admit they supported him.  American politics is soooo 'us vs them' its absolutely unreal. That is not a representation of only Trump supporters. Where did I say otherwise?   Yet Sanders & Trump supporters went over the edge about Hillary starting WW3 when Trump had the same idea.   That is great. He took the idea from the [Obama Administration](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-turkey-usa-idUSKCN0QG1UG20150811) It's possible for Clinton to propose two different type of zones, especially if they are not at all the same thing >You damn well know that a no fly zone is not at all the same thing  What is the difference - please explain it to me.  >you shill  That's just sad. What does this have to do with Saudi Arabia taking in refugees?  This is about establishing zones INSIDE OF Syria and yemen.   >I can't wait to hear how this is a bad thing though, I'll get CTR a few hours for their marching orders.  Just look through Trump supporters comments about Hillary's plan. > idea exclusive to Hillary Clinton's failed billion dollar campaign.   Trump was talking about Syrian safe zone as early as October 2015. To say that 'he stole the idea from Hillary' is moronic.   http://www.today.com/news/donald-trump-calls-syrian-safe-zone-says-refugees-shouldnt-come-t52136     He is not Hitler. He is a dumber Mussolini.  As an Aussie who couldn't give two shits about American politics, could you share some of them? #CANTSTUMPTHETRUMP US has sanctions only on some Russian elite and theyve banned the sale of only some goods to Russia, its nowhere near the ban that was imposed on Iran where you couldnt do anything in Iran except maybe travel. Plus all business conducted was way before any sanction on Russia was imposed, holy shit you people are fucking retarded read your own fucking source you fucking idiot. A no fly zone isnt the same as a refugee camp.  You need to do some research on this topic before posting. It might, it's all about location, if they intend in creating these in Syria we're in serious trouble. She even used the terms ""safe zones"" to describe them.  refugee camps. > It would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians  That doesn't sound like Russian support to me. Just because she used the term ""safe zones"" doesnt mean that her plan was the same as what is being proposed here.  Not sure if you are just really confused or being deliberately partisan. It borders Yemen so a safe zone / refugee camp would accommodate people displaced from the conflict there. I mean a week ago i would have said ""good luck having Saudi Arabia being okay with safe zones on their soil."" The whole geo-political climate right now is so unpredictable because the US elected such a change agent into the mix. I was merely posing a possible (maybe not probable) scenario . Really? You mean the Wahhabists are going to protect people from ISIS. Literally the group responsible for ISIS is going to protect people from Islamic terrorism? This is going to take a major commitment of manpower from the US or there's no point in even bothering. One more factor driving terrorism.   It was off a list created by Obamas DHS on which countries had the highest threat of refugees coming.  The sad reality is that SA is a huge business partner of the US and thus the US will not ban them.    As for why trump didn't , probably because hes very new and inexperienced as POTUS asked which countries are the biggest threat, got obamas list and ran with it without a second thought.    In the end, SA should absolutely be on the list, but remember the list is only good for ~90-120 days Hes making a joke about safe spaces... Yes, they're not even similar, in one of those areas they'd protect civilians from violence, while in the other they'd protect civilians from violence.  You guys are still using that term? Cute. And? Hes still head of the joint cheifs. You said it was Bannon, you are wrong. That was already being done though. Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and yes, even Saudi Arabia and Iran have taken in far more refugees than all of Europe. And there's no point in sending refugees to Yemen (or in Yemen) because it's as badly war torn and violent as Syria is. That's not to mention that it's the US backed Saudis that are fucking with them. The Houthis and other rebel groups don't give a shit about your ""safe zones"".  Edit: Mass downvoted and received a comment completely irrelevant to what I was pointing out. Kek. There are already safe zones in syria, in government controlled territory.   That's nice that they can take the time from laying waste to those countries to create safe zones in them.  Lol Reddit likes Saudi Arabia now? Trump really is a miracle worker. Cut and Pasting some prepared text to counter a point is nice. But can you point me to one example where a Iranian citizen was involved in a terrorist act on U.S soil? Then I'll point you to a list of Saudis and Pakistanis that in fact did kill a shit ton of Americans on U.S soil.   No one is denying that Iran isn't sponsor terrorism in the Middle-East. Again, we're talking about preventing terrorism on U.S soil.    Killing invading Israeli, American, and Saudi soldiers isn't terrorism and is also good because it deters others from starting wars. Thank you defenders of sovereignty, IRGC.  >Saudi Arabia  and I get along great with all of them. They buy apartments from me, Trump said in Mobile, Ala.  >They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much.   http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/736569/Donald-Trump-eight-companies-Saudi-Arabia-US-election-campaign  >PRESIDENT-ELECT Donald Trump registered eight new companies in Saudi Arabia during his campaign to reach the White House, it has been revealed.  >The Republican registered the companies in August 2015, shortly after launching his bid to become the next US President.  -  >Trump vowed he would protect Saudi Arabia from a potential Iranian threat - although said the Middle Eastern country would have to help the US economically. Considering I'm out here protesting against this, no I am not. Until one day the straw breaks the camel's back. You think Russia has forgotten about that jet? Donnie and Vlad may be pulling all sorts of strings behind the scenes but they can't control the entire world, and they are certainly pissing a lot of people off.  The difference is that Trump is willing to work *with* Russia while Clinton wanted to keep them out. You are confused, these are totally different things.  A no fly zone would mean that the US would have to attack any Russian or Syrian plane flying in that area.   A safe zone is where the Saudis cough up some money to set up a refugee camp for Syrian refugees to live in.   Oh look, I read the same article.   >Hillary Clinton forcefully defended her support for a no-fly zone in Syria at the third presidential debate on Wednesday night.   >It was the first time she was pressed by a debate moderator about risks the controversial policy would pose. The moderator, Fox News Chris Wallace, asked Clinton to explain how she would avoid getting into a larger war with either Russia or Syria.

Destroying anti-air facilities in a foreign country to create a no-fly zone which excludes the host country and its allies does not sound like a good strategy. Something that Obama and the the top Generals in the country both agree on, sounds like advice to adhere to don't you think?   Also:   >Help them there, instead of bringing them here. So much better for everyone.    Kinda obvious isn't it what's different? One is willing to work with Assad , the other wants to dispose of Assad and has actively supported the rebels cause . Can Americans stop supporting revolutions in other countries for a change?  Your article has literally nothing to do with in country safe zones. Nice try, but pretty far off the mark. Because Cllinton's idea was a ""NO FLY ZONE"", which is something completely different.  Is that too hard to understand? Clinton was proposing unilaterally enforcing a no-fly Zone in a an airspace dominated by Russian fighter jets, you have to be super slow not to see how dangerous that is. Many others have explained this to you already in this thread..   I too dislike many of the actions our president has taken in his first nine days, that does not mean I won't commend him when he takes actions I, and many others view as positive.. It's important to acknowledge good actions, even when undertaken by those leaders you are against, lest politics in our nation's becomes more polarized, spiteful, and petty.... Woah woah, re read what he said. You two are on the same side I like that he did away with the TPP Here's some military expertise on the matter   ""I do think that it presents escalation risks,"" Melissa Dalton, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who was formerly a country director for Syria at the Department of Defense, told Business Insider.  ""If the US decides to pursue a safe zone, it needs to do so in the broader framework that looks at what sort of levers, what sort of coercive measures can the US bring to bear on Russia, Assad, and Iran to ensure that the safe zone is not violated and to mitigate the risks of military confrontation.""  It's unclear whether a safe zone would mean imposing no-fly restrictions above the territory, but it's likely that protecting the airspace would be necessary to guard against airstrikes. And if that is the case, the US might need to be prepared to shoot down any aircraft that violates the no-fly zone - a move that could lead to war.  ""I don't think my country is willing to risk World War III over Syria,"" Robert Ford, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute who was the US ambassador to Syria from 2011 to 2014, told Business Insider in June.  Trump himself said in October that his then-political rival's plan for resolving the Syrian conflict, which included establishing no-fly zones and safe zones, would ""lead to World War III."" He used the same logic many experts are now using to express skepticism about his own plan.  ""What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,"" Trump told The Guardian. ""You're going to end up in World War III over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.""  He continued: ""You're not fighting Syria anymore, you're fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk.""  Russia also issued a veiled warning to the Trump administration.  Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, said in a conference call with reporters Thursday that it's important for the US to ""think about the potential consequences of establishing safe zones"" in Syria.  Dalton explained that with Russia's involvement in the Syrian civil war, ""any sort of military intervention by the US whether it's a no-fly zone or a safe zone would have to be coordinated with the Russians."" Assad might also need to be involved in negotiations about a no-fly zone so that all parties in the conflict are in agreement about which areas are off-limits.  ""If there were terms struck with Russia and Assad such that they were supportive of the creation of this safe zone and it was far enough distance away from where extremist groups are operating such that Assad and the Russians are not going to strike in that area, perhaps the requirements for a complete no-fly zone might not be as strong,"" Dalton said.  But the problem with this strategy is that the Assad regime considers his opposition to be comprised completely of terrorists, meaning he'd be unlikely to support a safe-zone that included rebels who oppose him.  ""Given the marbled nature of the different groups that are present in northern Syria, it's very difficult to separate the interlaced communities that the US may deem as civilians versus what Assad and the Russians deem as a threat or extremists,"" Dalton said.  ""That then leads to the potential of escalation, whether or not the US has a strong no-fly zone in place or not."" Negotiating with Assad would also likely require concessions for his regime, which Syrians would not be happy with.  Additionally, protecting the safe zone would likely require an increased presence of US troops on the ground, and that also carries potential for escalation.  ""A safe zone is more than a no-fly zone,"" Ford, the former ambassador to Syria, said in an email Friday. ""It presumably means that not only do enemy airplanes [not] drop bombs on civilians, but there is no tank/artillery shelling into the safe zone either.   That means, of course, the possibility of [the US Air Force] attacking Syria/Iran-backed forces on the ground if they fire into the zone.""Jim Phillips, a Middle East expert at the Heritage Foundation, told Reuters that ""this essentially boils down to a willingness to go to war to protect refugees.""    http://www.businessinsider.com/trumps-safe-zones-syria-refugees-world-war-2017-1?utm_content=buffer76a5c&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer  No she did not she pushed for a no Fly zone that would be illegal under International law. The no Fly zone would have to be passed by the UN like they did in Libya. Russia would Veto it since they want there puppet to stay in power. If the USA just put up a no fly zone by them selfs like she wanted you Risk starting a war with Russia. Th head of Joint Chiefs of Staff said to enforce a no fly zone we would have to go to war with Syria and Russia.    And how are those safe zones if Syria / Russia / whoever can conduct airstrikes on them?  A safe zone has to be a no fly zone, hate to break it to you. That's because you just ignored the part where she said it would take a lot of negotiations, so you can portray it as a threat. oh ffs. The safe zones are going to be IN Syria and yemen.  This is not about refugee camps in neighboring countries. The safe zones would be inside Syria, not inside Saudi Arabia. In one of those areas you protect civilians from violence and in another one you protect ISIS from Russian and Turkish jets. Fixed it for you.  I said he's the head of NSC. Read the comma.  actually saidi arabia counted people who were from syria and already living there before the war as refugees. in fact, if you arent a emeriate, you never can be, even if you and your parents were born there. the emirates technically can deport the entire family if they want to as they are not citizens. Now there will be more. What about this is hard to understand? Holy shit I love your name Completing missing the point of one being *state sponsored*. And that was more than 15 years ago. Since then the vetting process for Saudi citizens applying for visas have improved drastically and Saudi Arabia have focused and maximized its efforts to counter terrorism within the kingdom.  How about [this](http://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/13/world/meast/beirut-marine-barracks-bombing-fast-facts/index.html)? Invading Israeli soldiers? Where did these come from?   Oh, I remember you.. You were saying that flying over a country is equivalent to raiding it.   I guess bombing weapon convoys to Hezbollah is equivalent to invading soldiers in your eyes. [removed] If the zone isn't protected from airstrikes, it isn't a safe zone.  A safe zone by the very definition requires it to be a no-fly zone.  Clinton even described the zones as safe zones. Uh huh? Yeah   >Clinton did not directly answer how she would react if a Russian plane breached a no-fly zone established by the U.S.   >Nor did Clinton address the Syrian casualties that might result from a no-fly zone. In a 2013 speech to Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs, Clinton told attendees that establishing a no-fly zone would kill a lot of Syrians, because it would require the U.S. to take out Syrian air defenses, which are located in populous areas. >Destroying anti-air facilities in a foreign country to create a no-fly zone which excludes the host country and its allies does not sound like a good strategy. Something that Obama and the the top Generals in the country both agree on, sounds like advice to adhere to don't you think?  That was not Hillary's idea.  >Kinda obvious isn't it what's different?   Nope.  I still don't see the difference. Um, it brings us to the (extremely) obvious point that due to the cost of living being higher in Germany than in, let's say Jordan?  You accused me of being off the mark but you had nothing relevant to comment about the points I brought up.  Or would you like to try to argue that it would cost the same to house a refugee in Germany than in Jordan? Agreed, she didn't mind going to war with Russia over this shit, Im still skeptical of an implementation of a no-fly zone, especially with KSA involved. But Clinton wanted more war over there under the guise of ""humanitarianism"", ya know just like that wonderful Libyan intervention, hows that going for the average Libyan now. Yeah Libya is a completely failed state in a 3 way civil war, but atleast the relatively stable and secular govt. was destroyed and that awful Gaddafi is gone, ugh. Im pissed about this whole election and this a scary time to live in America -    -But atleast the president isnt on tape being absolutely giddy over the assasination, torture, and sodomy by bayonet of a foreign leader: ""we came we saw he died"" :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgcd1ghag5Y  Atleast that fucking war criminal and her ilk are gone, thats a silver lining. >Many others have explained this to you already in this thread..   And they were all wrong.  safe zones ARE no fly zones - if they weren't, by simple logic they aren't safe zones.    Please give me some evidence that they don't involve enforcing no-fly zones.   edit:   >The no fly zone has many euphemistic synonyms such as buffer zone, safe zone, safe haven, humanitarian corridor and other innocent sounding terms.  http://freedom-articles.toolsforfreedom.com/no-fly-zone-buffer-safe-zone-scam/  >I too dislike many of the actions our president has taken in his first nine days, that does not mean I won't commend him when he takes actions I, and many others view as positive.. It's important to acknowledge good actions, even when undertaken by those leaders you are against, lest politics in our nation's becomes more polarized, spiteful, and petty....  What the hell does this even mean? Lol, you linked to a fake news propaganda piece written by a Hillbot!  No wonder you are so confused... >No she did not  wtf do you mean?  >This would take a lot of negotiation. It would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our **purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground**.  -  >that would be illegal under International law. The no Fly zone would have to be passed by the UN like they did in Libya  No it wouldn't.  Second, what is the difference between a safe zone and a no fly zone?  >If the USA just put up a no fly zone by them selfs like she wanted you Risk starting a war with Russia.   She did not say she wanted to unilaterally enforce no fly zones.  >Th head of Joint Chiefs of Staff said to enforce a no fly zone we would have to go to war with Syria and Russia.  The head of the joint chiefs was NOT referring to Clinton's proposal, but a different one that involved controlling the entire airspace of Syria.  That is not what Clinton talked about.  Negotiations don't imply support. You could negotiate a prison sentence with a judge, doesn't mean the two of you agree. And Russia would negotiate with Hillary, why? But the russians hate her... Remember the russian reset blunder... Apart from the safe zones in Oman that you asked about in the comment I replied to. And yes, it is about refugees. They're not just making safe zones for fun. Right this makes a lot more sense. Don't know where my confusion came from  Sorry, that can be read two ways, are you saying the Russians are the terrorists, or the terrorists would be protected from the Russians? Both would be true enough.  I approve bannon if he does a good job ""He made Bannon the head of the NSC, The Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff and the Director of National Intelligence... He replaced the entire military command with a fucking Internet blogger, and you guys are still latching on to one thing he's done that may be good?""   You literally said that hes the head of the joint chiefs. Because our safe zones are for al-qaeda.   It involves Trump, there has to be a negative... ^^/s Israel invaded and occupied Lebanon for nearly 2 decades and we lost hundreds of marines helping them do it.  Violating other country's airspace are acts of war, especially when you also drop fucking bombs.   [removed] I see, you are not confusing these terms, just deliberately misusing them by making up your own definitions for words.  Not a very convincing argument except to children... Has Trump directly answered how he will react if Russian or Syrian planes carry out airstrikes in his safe zones?  >Nor did Clinton address the Syrian casualties that might result from a no-fly zone. In a 2013 speech to Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs, Clinton told attendees that establishing a no-fly zone would kill a lot of Syrians, because it would require the U.S. to take out Syrian air defenses, which are located in populous areas.   And fast forward a few years, and she said they would be established via negotiations.  Source? How would this cause WW3 with an economically weak Russia and Trump's scenario would not?  ""I do think that it presents escalation risks,"" Melissa Dalton, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who was formerly a country director for Syria at the Department of Defense, told Business Insider.  ""If the US decides to pursue a safe zone, it needs to do so in the broader framework that looks at what sort of levers, what sort of coercive measures can the US bring to bear on Russia, Assad, and Iran to ensure that the safe zone is not violated and to mitigate the risks of military confrontation.""  It's unclear whether a safe zone would mean imposing no-fly restrictions above the territory, but it's likely that protecting the airspace would be necessary to guard against airstrikes. And if that is the case, the US might need to be prepared to shoot down any aircraft that violates the no-fly zone - a move that could lead to war.  ""I don't think my country is willing to risk World War III over Syria,"" Robert Ford, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute who was the US ambassador to Syria from 2011 to 2014, told Business Insider in June.  Trump himself said in October that his then-political rival's plan for resolving the Syrian conflict, which included establishing no-fly zones and safe zones, would ""lead to World War III."" He used the same logic many experts are now using to express skepticism about his own plan.  ""What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,"" Trump told The Guardian. ""You're going to end up in World War III over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.""  He continued: ""You're not fighting Syria anymore, you're fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk.""  Russia also issued a veiled warning to the Trump administration.  Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, said in a conference call with reporters Thursday that it's important for the US to ""think about the potential consequences of establishing safe zones"" in Syria.  Dalton explained that with Russia's involvement in the Syrian civil war, ""any sort of military intervention by the US whether it's a no-fly zone or a safe zone would have to be coordinated with the Russians."" Assad might also need to be involved in negotiations about a no-fly zone so that all parties in the conflict are in agreement about which areas are off-limits.  ""If there were terms struck with Russia and Assad such that they were supportive of the creation of this safe zone and it was far enough distance away from where extremist groups are operating such that Assad and the Russians are not going to strike in that area, perhaps the requirements for a complete no-fly zone might not be as strong,"" Dalton said.  But the problem with this strategy is that the Assad regime considers his opposition to be comprised completely of terrorists, meaning he'd be unlikely to support a safe-zone that included rebels who oppose him.  ""Given the marbled nature of the different groups that are present in northern Syria, it's very difficult to separate the interlaced communities that the US may deem as civilians versus what Assad and the Russians deem as a threat or extremists,"" Dalton said.  ""That then leads to the potential of escalation, whether or not the US has a strong no-fly zone in place or not."" Negotiating with Assad would also likely require concessions for his regime, which Syrians would not be happy with.  Additionally, protecting the safe zone would likely require an increased presence of US troops on the ground, and that also carries potential for escalation.  ""A safe zone is more than a no-fly zone,"" Ford, the former ambassador to Syria, said in an email Friday. ""It presumably means that not only do enemy airplanes [not] drop bombs on civilians, but there is no tank/artillery shelling into the safe zone either.   That means, of course, the possibility of [the US Air Force] attacking Syria/Iran-backed forces on the ground if they fire into the zone.""Jim Phillips, a Middle East expert at the Heritage Foundation, told Reuters that ""this essentially boils down to a willingness to go to war to protect refugees.""  http://www.businessinsider.com/trumps-safe-zones-syria-refugees-world-war-2017-1?utm_content=buffer76a5c&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer  >Nope. I still don't see the difference.   Are you being dense?   >Help them there, instead of bringing them here.   >expanding the refugee program    >Um, it brings us to the (extremely) obvious point that due to the cost of living being higher in Germany than in, let's say Jordan  Which is ENTIRELY irrelevant to the cost of setting up a safe zone in theater.   Let's say a safe zone takes a single brigade on the small side (say 1500 troops) to secure. At, say, [a million dollars per troop](https://www.yahoo.com/news/it-costs--2-1-million-per-year-for-each-soldier-deployed-in-afghanistan--report-133150602.html?ref=gs), you can see how the cost of each safe zone could explode very quickly. Add that to the fact that you would have to bring in food, water, etc to these areas (not like the local Costco is open) and  the idea that a safe zone is somehow cheaper is ludicrous. A no fly zone is a ""a designated area over which aircraft may not fly without risk of interception, especially during a conflict.""  A safe zone is area of space where its safe to be at with out risk getting attacked form the other side.   Yes it is illegal to put up a no fly zone..... Right now what the US is doing in Syria is illegal Under international law. The only foreign power who has the Right to be in Syria airspace is Russia since Syria is allowing them.   The Russians would have never agreed to a no fly zone nor would the Syrians. They need the air power to keep the ""moderate"" rebels at bay other terrorist groups.  Also i want to add there is no more Moderate rebels if there was any at all. all the strong ""rebel groups who have the money and the power are Jaish al-Sunna, Ansar al-Din, JFS, Nour Din Zinki, & Liwa al-Haq Jaysh al-Nasr who are all radical  Islamist Groups. Not more then a few days ago they got together and formed the Tahrir al-Sham. There was never any Moderates Rebels maybe at the start of the war but there is none now The Free syria army has worked with Hezbollah ISIS and is still working with Jaysh al-Nasr.     Palxma you should look more into Facts Read whats going on down on the Ground. My friend who lives in Turkey is fighting with the People's Protection Units YPG for short Keeps me updated on whats going on there when he can. Hes been fighting ISIS with YPG since 2014. I will Trust his info on the ground more then I can trust media sources so please keep up your ideology misdirection and misinformation campaign.   >Negotiations don't imply support.  I never said otherwise. >Apart from the safe zones in Oman that you asked about in the comment I replied to  What safe zones in Oman?! If they're in Oman, they're not safe zones!  >And yes, it is about refugees.   I never said it wasn't ffs.  Work on your reading comprehension.  >They're not just making safe zones for fun.  jesus christ. Thought so.   The Joint Chief if Staff and the Director of National Intelligence are no longer on his list of advisors.   You keep skirting this.  We're probably never going to add Saudi Arabia to the travel ban list at this rate? Didn't he already secure a weapons deal with the Saudis ? I'm sure that played a part in negotiations, they aren't exactly gonna do it out of the kindness of their hearts. That would make sense if I voted for Trump. But that doesn't matter. You've spent so much time lapping up bullshit that you didn't realize that this was what was promised during his campaign. So this is him doing what he said. Also, why are safe zones bad?  > Israel invaded and occupied Lebanon for nearly 2 decades and we lost hundreds of marines helping them do it.  I wasn't aware anyone was talking about 20 years ago... How does this relate to the current thread?  >Trump supporter  >terrorist sympatizer  My kek is at the peak of Mt. Everest. >I see, you are not confusing these terms, just deliberately misusing them by making up your own definitions for words.  I am no misusing them nor am I making up my own definition.  A safe zone is a place for refugees WITH a no fly zone attached, nor matter how much you want to deny it.  >Not a very convincing argument except to children...   Funny, that was my reaction to your comments. >Has Trump directly answered how he will react if Russian or Syrian planes carry out airstrikes in his safe zones?   Nope. He wants to work with them rather then try to dispose of them.    >And fast forward a few years, and she said they would be established via negotiations.   Did you read the article?    >Clinton stuck to an argument she has made many times: Creating an area where Syrian and Russian planes cannot fly would give the U.S. leverage over Syria and Russia to negotiate a political resolution.   >A no-fly zone can save lives and hasten the end of the conflict, she said.    >With proper planning, Clinton argued, the restriction could accomplish those goals without sparking a larger war.   >I am well aware of the really legitimate concerns you have expressed from both the president and the general, Clinton responded. This would not be done just on the first day. This would take a lot of negotiation. It would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground.   This is an open threat to do what USA says or else. Coupled with her role in arming the rebels to dispose of Assad.   >As secretary of state, Clinton was a voice for more aggressive military intervention in Syria, calling early in the conflict for arming Syrian rebel groups. She also played a key role in convincing Obama to depose Libyan dictator Muammar Gadhafi in 2011.   >Clintons Syria strategy represents a belief shared by many foreign policy experts that failing to act more decisively to facilitate the ouster of Syrian President Bashar Assad has allowed the Syrian regime to commit atrocities and enabled extremist militants to flourish in the country.   Did you honestly think they would react well to that? That was what Hillary proposed...creating safe zones in Syria for refugees...I'm not sure why this is so hard for you to grasp. What would the UN be doing until then? Ideally you'd have the UN enforce a safe zone, and I doubt it costs that much. Your link talks about the costs of deployment in Afghanistan which isn't as relevant to this situation.   Afghanistan is a very unique country which is hard to occupy beyond main cities, costs going up there is to be expected. Especially when they're deployed for a mission.  The cost of safe zones would vary depending on *where* it is located as well, and notice that in your link it talks about how the cost was much different during the Iraq war.   But yes it is still too expensive for my liking. UN peace keeping forces + hired private soldiers from a company such as Blackwater would be a better alternative.  It shouldn't cost MORE than the Iraq war at the very least, as the objective would be to guard the safe zone, instead of waging a land war deep inside enemy territory where supplying becomes so much more expensive.   Regardless, if the Saudi king's promise is to be trusted I'm sure it is expected that they will use their soldiers with their money. The cost of US soldiers is probably much more compared to the cost of Saudi soldiers. It'll also be ideal if multiple countries foot the bill together so no one really takes too much of a hit.  Also there seems to be a misunderstanding, when I said that it would be ""cheaper to house them there"" I meant it as to the countries, rather than the safe zones. If it proves to be that housing them in their neighboring countries would be cheaper then that is what should happen instead of a safe zone.  hope I didn't ramble too much.. >A safe zone is area of space where its safe to be at with out risk getting attacked form the other side.  And how is a safe zone a safe zone if it isn't a no fly zone?  If Russia / Syria can conduct air-strikes inside, it isn't a safe zone, and wouldn't meet the very qualifications you just laid out. Please point to some evidence that Trump's safe zone idea doesn't involve a no-fly zone.  edit:  >The no fly zone has many euphemistic synonyms such as buffer zone, safe zone, safe haven, humanitarian corridor and other innocent sounding terms.   http://freedom-articles.toolsforfreedom.com/no-fly-zone-buffer-safe-zone-scam/   >Yes it is illegal to put up a no fly zone.....  No it is not.  You really haven't thought this through. If Syria (and Russia) allowed it, how would it be illegal?  >The Russians would have never agreed to a no fly zone nor would the Syrians. They need the air power to keep the ""moderate"" rebels at bay other terrorist groups.  Then you're saying Trump's plan is dead in the water.  Because safe zones ARE no fly zones.  >Also i want to add there is no more Moderate rebels if there was any at all. all the strong ""rebel groups who have the money and the power are Jaish al-Sunna, Ansar al-Din, JFS, Nour Din Zinki, & Liwa al-Haq Jaysh al-Nasr who are all radical Islamist Groups.

There was never any Moderates Rebels maybe at the start of the war but there is none now The Free syria army has worked with Hezbollah ISIS and is still working with Jaysh al-Nasr.  Irrelevant.  >Palxma you should look more into Facts Read whats going on down on the Ground.  I've forgotten more facts than you've ever known.  >My friend who lives in Turkey is fighting with the People's Protection Units YPG for short Keeps me updated on whats going on there when he can. Hes been fighting ISIS with YPG since 2014.   Sure thing.   >I will Trust his info on the ground more then I can trust media sources so please keep up your ideology misdirection and misinformation campaign.  And what part of his experience / info is relevant to this discussion?    Is there something wrong with that? Lol Im not skirtting anything. You said that Bannon was the head of the joint chiefs. I was only pointing out that you were wrong. They're too much of an ally to do so, both politically and economically. In addition to their strategic position in that neck of the woods which benefits us. Because we call them terrorists for defending their country.   Lol. I'm not making up my own definitions....Proceeds to make up your own definition.   >Nope. He wants to work with them rather then try to dispose of them.  Great.  So Trump is doing the same thing you criticized Hillary for.  >This is an open threat to do what USA says or else. Coupled with her role in arming the rebels to dispose of Assad.  It is not.  >Did you honestly think they would react well to that?   Nope - no fly zones in Syria will never be supported by Putin / Assad, no matter who is the US president. I have no reason to believe they will react well to Trump's plan either - despite you and the other Trump supporters acting like it's already happened! Explain how that is any different from Trump?  Honestly, this just shows her and Obama's incompetency.  It's like they knew what had to be done, but they were utterly clueless about how to go about doing it tactfully.      It's the same thing with the 'Russian Reset'.  I keep hearing how Obama/Hillary already tried that.  Of course they *tried*.  But they failed because they were clueless.      Trump is actually merging these two together: normalizing Russian relations on equal footing and negotiating safe zones in the middle-east on its back. While also expanding the refugee program to America which was the whole point of this whole conversation, help them there instead of bringing them to America. I'm not sure why you are ignoring this. I said he's the head of the NSC. Holy shit I'll edit the whole thing so a baby can understand it.  If we make them our friend, does that stop them from sending explosives us or are they more like my ex? http://freedom-articles.toolsforfreedom.com/no-fly-zone-buffer-safe-zone-scam/   >The no fly zone has many euphemistic synonyms such as buffer zone, safe zone, safe haven, humanitarian corridor and other innocent sounding terms.   https://theintercept.com/2016/10/05/did-tim-kaine-and-mike-pence-realize-that-safe-zones-in-syria-would-require-u-s-troops/  >By contrast, safe zones or humanitarian corridors, which have a more extensive objective of protecting civilians in a territory from all types of violence  whether it be attacks from the air, artillery and small arms fire, require much more than just an end to aerial bombardments.  http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jun/21/reconsidering-safe-zones-in-syria/  >Though often used interchangeably, safe zones and no-fly zones actually represent different levels of commitment. Generally, a no-fly zone prevents hostile action from the air only, while a safe zone implies an area secure from both airborne and ground attack that often requires the commitment of air and ground forces. Him being more open to actually working with the Syrians and Russians instead of threatening them and actively working to undermine the current govt by funding rebels might just work out better in negotiations. We will just have to see. hahaha, oh god. I don't think you grasp how many people we're talking about.  The US admited about 10,000 refugees from Syria, they're are millions of them in total. You can expand the refugee program while still helping people there, they're not mututally exclusive (unless you live in a pathetically simplistic delusion).  And that was never the point of the conversation. 
"
"44",43,"5qvi7l","2017-01-29","This did make me laugh. I got a mental picture of someone running down a runway with a screwdriver in their hand. In 1996 4 activists in UK managed to do $2 million damage to a Hawk fighter sold to Indonesia. Although they were caught, a jury agreed with their action and found them [not guilty](http://www.ipsnews.net/1996/07/britain-indonesia-women-who-wrecked-jet-in-timor-protest-walk-free/) of criminal damage. Why do the people of Britain allow their government to sell weapons to the House of Saud?  There is a lot of evidence to show that the Saudis perpetrate significant harm throughout the region, they still use cluster bombs, as well as [funding terrorists](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/31/combat-terror-end-support-saudi-arabia-dictatorships-fundamentalism). I think Western Governments support Saudi because it's (In theory) a stabilising force in the region.   We've seen what happens when you remove dictators in Muslim countries (Libya, Iraq, Syria, Egypt all engaged in vicious conflict with no end in sight)  Also for the simple fact that money talks, bullshit walks. We all enjoy the benefits of living in the land of plenty and we have our respective governments moral repugnance to thank for our wealth, that's the harsh reality. If only planes destined for Saudi Arabia are actually in any way armed.  The most dangerous thing on it when it flys there are the large fuel tanks (as the residents at the campsite beyond the end of the runway would agree when a Tornado destined for Saudi dropped its tanks as it took off.  Big fireball. Big boom.)   Fun fact.  The pilot ended up being my boss. So which is the bigger crime? The disarmers or the countries arming a hostile foreign power?  how come they get good pictures and not the normal mug shot style when you get arrested (which i got when i was arrested) We need more people like this. These people are heroes. The UK government is basically allied with and a key supporter of a terror regime at this point. Just send the activists with the planes. I'm sure Saudi Arabia would have fun with em.  If we're gonna Brexit then we're gonna have to sell to Saudi Arabia. End of story. Beggars can't be choosers.  They should be investigated for terror affiliated links and prosecuted.  Actually a demagnetiser. It's really heavy and takes two at least two carry. It's also why they got caught. Like the person who ran onto the runway in Shannon Airport with axe   https://www.google.ie/amp/s/www.irishtimes.com/news/suspended-sentence-for-taking-axe-to-us-aircraft-1.1168249%3Fmode%3Damp?client=ms-android-h3g-ie Maybe they got arrested because they didn't have permits for them dangerous screwdrivers they're pretty sharp  They wanted to be caught as it was a protest rather than an attack. However, the base patrol passed them by a bunch of times and they had to ring the media to turn themselves in. That's ace. Love that their nickname was the ploughshares TIL. Thanks mate that's pretty cool  Canada's doing it too :( It's a complicated issue, but I think I can sum it up....MONEY Because the reality is that the world is not a nice place and the House of Saud pays good money for weapons. If the British stopped selling to them, there are maybe 10 other countries that would step in and do it instead.  America loves to do it as well, well maybe not anymore > Why do the people of Britain allow their government to sell weapons to the House of Saud?  because money's money.   people moan at america for trying to be the 'world police' - people moan at countries that aren't trying to be the world police; seems people just moan for the sake of moaning. Saudi Arabia is prominent power in the Middle east whose defence budget is rising -- more money for arms sellers. Another thing is that by selling weapons that requires specialist maintenance from the UK, they have a leash over Saudi Arabia in the event that they might turn hostile. It also stops them from reaching out to other prominent superpowers like China or Russia and ensures that Saudi  Government is (somewhat) aligned to the UK's interests. The last point is admittedly weak and arguable but the terrorist funding has been from Saudi citizens and not from the Government. Because British people don't care, just like Americans don't. We protest and sign petitions but both labour and the tories weren't going to stop selling them. It's only after the election when Corbyn became leader of the labour party that we had a party that good oppose it. Well, name a country with an armaments industry that doesn't sell said arms to somewhat unpalatable countries.  The fact of the matter is that if the UK didn't sell the Saudi's arms, someone else would. At least this way, the UK has at least *some* leverage over how they're used.  I assume the aircraft in question is one of the 72 Eurofighter Typhoons that BAE are building for the Saudi Air Force. because apathy and stuff  America does too. Why do you think they aren't on the banned list  Because most brits don't care, they get their news and views from shitty Murdoch outlets which does nothing but promote racial tension to remove the populations focus on actual pressing matters, we were tricked into leaving the EU by a Kremlin collaborator and now we've got a PM who has no fucking clue what she's doing and we're now slaves to our Tory overlords thanks to the inept Labour party and Jeremy Corbyn.  >Why do the people of Britain allow their government to sell weapons to the House of Saud?  There is a lot of evidence to show that the Saudis perpetrate significant harm throughout the region  If the violence is directed at Yemen, then I'm not going to cry.  If they don't buy British arms, they'll just buy Russian arms. Saudi Arabia are our allies  they are fighting alleged Iranian armed outfit with the slogan ""following: ""God Is Great,Death to America, Death toIsrael, Curse on theJews, Victory toIslam""   The west has a history of collusion with ""militant groups"" themselves  Weapons won't sell themselves. Believe me, I am doing all I can to stop it. But I'm up against criminal gangsters who call themselves the 'government'. The 'royal' family, whom you all love, lies at the heart of the evil organised crime syndicate that arms filthy regimes. The power of government flows from the obedience of the people. We are suffering collective Stockholm Syndrome. I plead with people not to obey government, but my voice is lonely and so the killing goes on.  The middle east will be fucked up no matter who we support, as long as it is Islamic. Leftists always do this sort of augery where they determine that the root cause of all the problems in an Islamic country can be traced back to whatever interaction we had with them. If it wasn't one thing, it would be another.  For instance it's often said that well of COURSE they're decapitating children over there, just look at where we put the borders after we dismantled the Ottoman Empire, which was extremely genocidal in itself. In all alternate universes, no matter where the borders are and no matter what we did with the Ottoman Empire, I guarantee you, Muslims are chopping people's heads off. If they stuck to themselves like Oman that would be a fair point, but they meddle and poke all across the Muslim world and the diaspora to infest old Muslim traditions with their salafi junk; and have directly destabilised Yemen (as well as being a major reason Syria and Iraq ahve become so polarised). The Saudi rulers are generally more liberal than the rest of the country and the lower nobility. If you thinks that sounds ridiculous, that's how threatening the rest of the population is. Destabilizing the world to stabilize a region isn't worth it.  I live in Warton, don't remember that. If they're on the wrong side of a Quaker then they're probably in the wrong.  So in this case, definitely the British government for selling war planes to SA. uhm dont act like western powers are not hostile powers, if not THE biggest hostile powers in the world. You're lying to yourself if you think otherwise.  The House Saud is not hostile. You are. And yet you are allowed to bear arms. A basic human right that you want denied to others. What's your agenda? In this case I'm not sure Brexit has anything to do with the British relationship was Saudi Arabia. From one of the EU main forces to Trump/Saudi lap dogs.   That would be a funny thing to watch. Wait, didn't I already watch some of it with Teresa May?      Brexit or no Brexit, we're going to try to sell them as much as possible.  I say it takes two, at least two to carry! See? The screwdriver would have worked better! A what?  I was in EOD so realise bombs go in rails etc, but a demagnetiser?  I still cant help picture stupid demonstrators running up a runway trying to unscrew one as it takes off. What on earth were they hoping to do with that? The SecNavy should have sent her a bill for the repair costs.  That's not true. The House of Saud built its power base in central Arabia in the 1700s, long before European intervention in the region. They built the modern Saudi state through conquest in the 1910s and 1920s without any Western help. In fact, they overthrew and conquered the British-backed Kingdom of Hejaz. What's wrong friend, not proud of our Feminist Arms Dealer PM?  So Trudeau is a fraud too. Guess Trump is the only one who is, as he appears and speaks.  The UK has a signiificant arms industry, it's not just a matter of this particular deal it's the fact that much of the industry will move in the government stops selling to places like Saudi Arabia.  Corbyn wouldn't ever take the country to war, the choice has always been in the voters hands. The only real march is the one to the voting booth.  That doesn't at all make it justified.  >the terrorist funding has been from Saudi citizens and not from the Government.  A member of the saudi royal family had a poster of the burning WTC in their home, so I'd say its closer than that. I best most aren't even aware. In the case the vast majority of British people don't really care.   you mean instead of leaving it to Quakers to be the only people with a conscience? I think the key issue here is western involvement and globalization has helped spread this violence to our countries. Hence the reasoning, they hate us because of our meddling, it would be better if they just hated each other. If by ""more liberal"" you mean ""more openly decadent"" sure. It's basically the difference between the Royalists and the Puritans in the English Civil War lol. It's not that ridiculous because the rulers are rich and have travelled abroad and been exposed to different cultures probably. And better educated. Mid 1990s.  My memory was about 1992/3 > If they're on the wrong side of a Quaker then they're probably in the wrong.  Oh that's hilarious. Moral Yardstick of the country.   The Saudis behead people for ""crimes"" such as apostasy and adultery and export terrorism all over the world. They're basically the same as ISIS, except with a lot more oil money. The House of Saud funded ISIS. If you want proof, get it from the emails of Hillary herself. http://dailycaller.com/2016/10/10/hillary-in-leaked-email-saudi-arabia-and-qatar-are-funding-isis/  No but he is right.   We used to trade freely with Europe, now we are going to need to up trade with whatever despot regimes we can sell to in order to make up any shortfall (even if only a few percent) from whatever new arrangement we see.  de-tango Too bad there wouldn't any ordinance on the plane, just fuel drop pods, if they were taking off to saudi arabia.  Modern planes today are held together using magnets, the technology of tomorrow. If you use a large enough demagnetiser on it the plane simply falls to pieces when they try to take off.  Seriously I just made it up and I am confused that no one has questioned it yet, extended it or pointed out how absurd it is. Finally someone who knows what they are talking about! The 1st Saudi state was even established decades before American independence. And yet people keep perpetuating this misconception that it was created by the British and equating it with Sykos/picot countries like Iraq and Syria.  Trump does a lot of business with Saudi Wonder why Saudi Arabia wasn't on the Muslim immigration ban list then.  So nor Corbyn, then. He is about as electable as a potato. US, S. Korea, China, France, Germany, Israel, India, Italy, Spain, Austria, South Africa, Turkey.    If I'm correct, aren't there thousands of members in the Saudi Royal family? Unless you mean the main family. We really don't care about much tbh. That's what Muricans actually believe. Your ""proof"" is an unverified email that allegedly has been written by a former government official. Honestly, I've seen better proof than that on /r/conspiracy. I'm really not sure that arms sales are currently being restricted by EU membership, or that the UK and UKTI isn't seeking out every possible avenue for sales that are in line with whatever government policy is in place. That should be reasonably clear in this case given that the UK is still a member of the EU and was during the entire period that the current UK sourced Saudi arms were procured.. > just fuel drop pods   Willing to bet the idiots thought  the pods were the ordinance. ...name 10 more. Shit. What do I do now? I scroll through this subreddit and just find myself tutting at everything. > Your ""proof"" is an unverified email that allegedly has been written by a former government official. Honestly, I've seen better proof than that on /r/conspiracy.  My apologies. It's just usually Clinton emails are relatively hard for Trump supporters to refute, given how much they were invoked during the election. It's nice to find someone who feels the same way-ish about them being used as a source. But the fact that Saudi Arabia funded ISIS and that Clinton knew is well known and documented by both sides. If you would like, I can assemble some sources, but simply searching ""saudi arabia isis"" brings up many news articles, both mainstream and not, from both the left and right showing that at the very least, saudis funded isis and the us gov. knew.  I don't read anything that would say EU prevents members to sellweaps to X nation. He spoke of trade loss compensation.  France for example has always sold weapon where it wanted to... Egypt, Qatar...   Are we really calling them idiots? Pretty sure these people knew they were going to be caught. This was a demonstration. They didn't get as far as they hoped. But it focused media attention on a pretty ugly activity. That's good. Disarm could simple be damaging the plane rather than taking weapons away from it  Thanks for letting the guy know as well. and what is your point? you just proved my statement right. The 1st Saudi State was established in 1744 and American independence was on 1776.  Best Korea, Iran, Russia, Canada, Japan, Australia, Malaysia, Sudan, Egypt, Brazil.  No, I was referring to general arms sales.  I think the point is that that state was destroyed. The second Saudi state was helped by the British. And? there is precedent. Its not like they came out of thin air or installed by a  foreign power. And they came back again with the 2nd Saudi State. And the 3rd. And to be able to rule such a  large area they need the backing of the tribes in the area which they had.  What are you asking me?  The first Saudi state was destroyed. The current Saudi state was helped by the British.  So when /u/wellwell said:  >house of saud was literally chosen by the british to rule the country  They were almost certainly talking about the current Saudi state, which was helped by the British, and the not previous destroyed one, which wasn't.  If the British hadn't helped, there might well have been a different power in the region, and so in that sense, they were chosen by the British. >  backing of the tribes  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikhwan  More like sending black flagged religious fanatics to remove anyone who hates them. It is really their style, even today.  inb4 I do not know what I am talking about. Buddy, I live in Kuwait and took a bunch of history classes about the region, mostly focusing on Kuwait but things kinda...over pour into each other. To say Saudis came to power by themselves would be foolish. Just ask Sir Percy Cox and Ibn Saud about how they stole two thirds of Kuwait total area.   ""Abdul Aziz Al-Saud and the Great Game in Arabia, 1896-1946"" Is a good read if you wanna know more about this. Heck, Kuwait only exists because Britain wanted it to. Not taking sides here. Only difference was Ibn Saud was more comfortable with using proxies and power to remove everyone in his way, hence way the ol' Queen liked him. The only one with such qualities in Kuwait was Amir Mubarak Al-Subah but his time was short lived and he started with a shittier hand for a conqueror.  If you read the history correctly, The Brits were backing the Hashmites and Al-Saud imposed themselves were the brits had to switch support. It wasn't like he begged them or they crowned him. They signed treaties between each other. And again the Hashmites were backed by the brits but didn't have the support of the rest of the peninsula and therefore they were weak and were driven out by Al-Saud.  I never said they came to power on their own but it would be a mistake to say that they were planted there by the Brits.   Edit: And the Kuwaiti sheikhs helped Abdulaziz, does that mean they have power or dominion over Saudi? And consider this after Saudi was formed who did they ally with? the Brits? no. they signed an alliance with the US so there was no obligation to the british.

"45",44,"5quype","2017-01-29","I'm Canadian, and I keep repeating the same thing and I've yet to get a good answer:  *Why did Trump ban those with a green card as well?*  He has always said, in every speech I can find, that he supports **legal immigration**, and it was only illegal immigration that was to be targeted as well as refugees.  And yet, here we are, and I still don't have an answer from anyone (including t_d who just ignore my question or give the answer of 'well they shouldn't have left the country'). Australian here. What confused me is the same day he introduced this ban, blocking green card holders from entering their own country, our prime minister gets on the phone to confirm the US will still accept hundreds of refugees we've kept locked up for years in offshore detention centres. Trump confirmed he still will. How can a country turn away its own residents based on their religion or country of birth yet still take hundreds of traumatised and angry refugees with the same religion that have been kept in prisons, developing mental health problems for years?   Edit. Source: http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-29/turnbull-and-trump-talk-about-refugee-resettlement-deal/8220824 Is this what it looks like when other civs denounce your civilization in real life? Have you ever read a history book and get to the part where there is a huge red flag for what's to come wasn't stopped by the people of that country/ timeline?  This entire week the history books that people in the future will read will wonder how we didn't stop what's to come despite that huge red flag.  Edit: word I responded with this quote for some else but I feel like others should see it and notice the incredibly similarities that is currently unfolding.   >Propaganda is the art of persuasion  persuading others that your side of the story is correct. Propaganda might take the form of persuading others that your military might is too great to be challenged; that your political might within a nation is too great or popular to challenge etc. In Nazi Germany, Dr Joseph Goebbels was in charge of propaganda. Goebbels official title was Minister of Propaganda and National Enlightenment.  **********************************************  >At no time up to 1933, did the Nazi Party win a majority of votes at elections. They may have been the largest political party in 1933, but they did not have a majority of support among the people. Therefore, those who had supported the Nazis needed to be informed on how correct their choice was with an emphasis on the strength of the party and the leadership. Those who opposed the Nazi Party had to be convinced that it was pointless continuing with their opposition. The fact that Goebbels had so much power is indicative of how important Hitler thought it was to ensure that the people were won over or intimidated into accepting Nazi rule. http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/nazi-germany/propaganda-in-nazi-germany/ As an Iranian-American and dual citizen, this saddens me greatly. I stay optimistic though.  I'm very glad European leaders are speaking out against this so directly. I could easily imagine everyone keeping their mouth shut (like Theresa May tried at first) considering how The Donald reacts to everyone that speaks out against him.   Meanwhile, since he became president, Trump has made his case for being USA's first true tyrant far quicker than I had imagined.   Of all the crazy stuff he's said, I didn't believe he would actually go forward with a muslim ban. Yet we are already (nearly) here. It makes me pretty nervous about what he will come up with in the coming years, or even weeks.  Edit; yeah yeah yeah, it's not a muslim ban. That's why i said nearly. He just made country bans effectivly banning muslims.  Something I have seen no one bring up about these countries in any response across the board.  Of the countries we banned, is there an active United States embassy?    Iran - over taken by the Iranians in 1979  Somalia - closed 1991 due to the Mogadishu revolution.  Libya - closed off and on. Closed since 2014.  Syria - closed 2012.  Yemen - suspended services in 2015  Sudan - Open.   Iraq -  largest embassy and over a billion dollars spent to build the ""fortress."" Due to the civil unrest there.   Food for thought.  So it's been a little over a week, and the political ramifications of Trump's actions are already being felt globally. This man is supposed to be representing American ideals, yet all he is doing is pandering to shortsighted bigots and fear mongers, while completely ignoring everybody else.   If this is the Trump train, then how far will it go? What extreme actions will his administration take next? What actions can the public take to put the U.S. back on the path of progress so we can focus on much more significant global issues?  As a Muslim, I feel so happy seeing the reaction of fellow Europeans and Americans. In a way, Trump's actions are bringing people closer to each other. For me, America (seemingly at its worst) is still the best nation in world and America/Europe in general will always be level ahead of rest of the world when it comes to human rights. I know I won't see anything like this in any of the Muslim country if these rights were taken away (Israeli passport holders are banned from 16 Muslim countries).  Sorry for incoherent comment but I really want to thank everyone who is speaking about this ban as it makes me a little less worried about the whole situation. I know it's going to be alright in the end :) This is purely unamerican and simply goes against our values. What a strange world we live in. When it was first announced Trump was going to run for President, I thought it was a joke.  There's no way he'd win.  When he got the nomination for Republican Candidate, I thought there's no way he'd beat Bernie Sanders.  When Hillary got the nomination instead, I thought well she should still be able to win.  It's Trump after all.  When Trump won, I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt despite his previous comments.  People can change, people were looking for change, maybe he could at least be an average president.  Fast forward to now, and it's clear these first few executive orders have been fired through with almost no planning or thought.  A wall no one wants to pay for, and now this.  It's one thing to say you're banning immigration from certain countries until you can put into place proper vetting procedures, especially when some of those countries could have a lot of pro daesh militants hidden in with actual immigrants.  It's something else entirely to completely ban travel for everyone from those countries, even when they already have valid visas and green cards to be in the country to begin with.  It reeks of a president who's desperate to make a name for himself now, rather than over the 4 years of his term.  I can only hope that he realises that these things need to be planned, and that it's ok to make sure of that rather than rushing in. This just shows how dangerous it is to elect an narcissist into office. I can't phantom how he didn't even think about individual families or people who are affected by this.   Imagine a father going on a business trip and being denied entry to see his family, Imagine an daughter wanting to visit her sick father in Iran, but can't leave the country for fear of not coming back, imagine a person losing their job, because they can't re-enter the country, Or imagine a person who feels trapped in their own country, because their parents were born somewhere else and they inherited a dual nationality.   I am not easily offended, but Trump tweet about muslims killing Christians in large numbers offended me to my very core. I can't understand how people can support this lunatic. He views people only in groups and not as individuals. He doesn't base his policy on facts, but on racism.   As a dutchman I have lost all respect for my prime minister. He  avoided the subject, and gave a luke warm condemnation of this ban after the opposition was outraged. Really, the world is a shitty place.  There are more important things than economic interest. We all live on this earth. Why do we put money over people? How can we ""allow"" this cheeto to do these type of things?   I can't understand why people support mr cheeto. I really cant. How can you harbor so much hatred for people just, because they look different than you?   Muslims today, tomorrow who? ""First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out Because I was not a Socialist.  Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out Because I was not a Trade Unionist.  Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out Because I was not a Jew.  Then they came for meand there was no one left to speak for me.""  This sets a worrying precedent. I'm an immigrant, I've been nationalized, but not my mother. She's terrified of what might happen if this ban gets extended to other countries - like the one we came from. However unlikely that may be, we as a people cannot stand to let this go unchallenged.   Donate to the ACLU, protest, let your voice be heard and most of all, VOTE IN THE MIDTERMS.  As a Canadian I'm going to say this without any remorse... if you think you're gonna come here to my country and impose YOUR native country's billiards rules on us.. well then you can go right into the bathroom and fuck yourself. I have enough problems with Australians thinking 2 shot fouls is the best way to play 8ball. Disgusting. Shameful. Blasphemy.  [removed] Smoke and mirrors is how this presidency will be recorded in history. Iran has blocked all US citizens from entering their country. Please add that to your list of international reactions. In my opinion it's a much bigger deal than various politicians' reactions to this.   http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/316684-iran-will-ban-us-citizens-from-entering-the-country-report Mo Farah represents British Olympic team but lives with his family in Portland. And he has a Somalian passport aswell?!  **The New Colossus** (Engraved on the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty):  Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,  With conquering limbs astride from land to land;  Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand  A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame  Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name  Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand  Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command  The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.  ""Keep ancient lands, your storied pomp!"" cries she  With silent lips. ""Give me your tired, your poor,  Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,  The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.  Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,  I lift my lamp beside the golden door!""   - Emma Lazarus (1883)  Dear citizens of the World, since when has democracy been considered more important than human rights, safety, and common sense?   To all Trump voters, every single mistake Trump makes, every human rights act he violates, all the blood he sheds. It is all on your hands.  I really hope that this world gets its stuff together.  Why can't we all just get along??? It just baffles me that there are people in this world that genuinely want to cause contention and discord (not necessarily do I think Trump wants this but this order is kind of the result of a messed up world).  Lets all just come together, be unified, love one another, respect one another, and live in peace.  I know this was kind of a weird rant for me and isn't just in response to this Exec. order, but more of a response to the current state of conditions in the world like prejudice, hate, war, etc.  It might be good to go out and be proactive in your communities to promote unity and community building and build relationships with people and empower younger kids and the youth to do service for the world and to be conscious of their words and actions.  Anyway, peace and love to everyone.       Does the USA even have a legitimate government at this point? Federal agents at an airport defied a federal court order in obedience to a Trump executive order. I don't remember this ever happening before.  I feel really sorry for the Iranian diaspora. Unlike some of the other nationalities on that list, only a tiny fraction of them are Islamists. Most of them are highly educated, hard working, and pro-western. They are the last people that Trump should be antagonising. Dear Muslims from around the world and in America  -Only 27% of eligible voters voted for Trump  -The Democrats won the popular votes in the Senate and Presidential race  -More people went to the women's march than President Cheetos inauguration  What's happening in the White House right now doesn't represent the best of America, most American didn't want this to happen. Theresa May has no backbone. She doesn't want to remove Trump's dick which is engraved in her throat. It was evident since she criticized Kerry's farewell speech about Israeli settlements just to win Trump's approval.    It's a real shame that criticism of anything to do with Islam has been made completely taboo in mainstream, moderate circles. To fill the void of sensible, intelligent critique, we can always rely on fanatical populists. Enter Trump.  I am of the Left, and I always have been. But I think it is fair to say that the Left is largely to blame for silencing critics of a religion that does, by any objective and honest reading of the texts, contain some uniquely nasty bits that can straightforwardly explain the actions of ISIS and al Qaeda.  That moderate, intelligent critics of this ideology are labelled ""racists"" does nothing to encourage healthy debate. Islam is not a race. Islam is a religion, an ideology. And I think most of us (perhaps besides the Islamists themselves!) can agree that *any* ideology is fair game for discussion and criticism in a Western, liberal, free society.  What we need to do in response to Trump's order  is not close discussion of Islam even further. In fact, we need the exact opposite: a respect for viewpoints that challenge the often-repeated claims about Islam being purely peaceful.  One nation is a minor political party that will never be in power. Our issue with people coming by boats is largely different to americas problem given that we are an island. If we let boat loads of people come in they will drown in the hundreds as they regularly have done in the past. You really make it sound like australians support what trump is doing and i think thats wrong because as i said the vast majority of us wouldnt. Very few Aussies support him, barring those who voted for one nation and are a waste of oxygen. I'm from Alabama, please send help. Aussies are cool with it.   In fact, we were way ahead of you but we keep it on the down low.   Check out our panic as this order was signed. Our Government's primary worry was that we wouldnt be able to swap muslim refugees with your hispanic ones. I'm a trump supporter but this executive action is just morally and ethically wrong. There has to be a better way. And why the fk isn't Saudi Arabia on the list since 16 out of 19 of the 9/11 terrorists were from there?!   this is copypasta from one of my friends on facebook, but should nonetheless be read in my opinion.    I am incredibly lucky. My family comes from different parts of India. I was born in Mumbai. When I was about 5 years old we moved to Denver. My Dad wanted to move to America so that he could work in a better job, provide for his family, and offer me (and later my little sister) the best educational opportunities possible. While working my parents went through the incredibly long, expensive, and difficult multi-year process of getting a permanent resident card (green card). But I never had to worry or stress about anything personally. In my senior year of high school, I applied for citizenship. Again, my parents helped me through the application process and thanks to fantastic public school teachers (another lucky break) I was able to pass the citizenship exam. Some people are even luckier.  A couple of years after we moved to Denver. My little sister was born. Since she was born on American soil, she is an American citizen and probably will never have to worry about any immigration issues. Im sure the same is the case for many of you reading this who were born in the USA, or whose families came here generations ago when the indigenous population didnt demand green cards or papers from the European colonizers. Unfortunately, some people are not so lucky. Millions of undocumented immigrants, who work hard alongside Americans, go to school alongside Americans, and volunteer and give back to their communities alongside Americans may not be so lucky under President Trump. Living every day worried about the threat of deportation in a country where the President has just given ICE wide latitude to determine who constitutes a threat, these immigrants may be forced to leave a country they have lived in and contributed to for decades. They may not have had the money or the education to navigate the complex mess that is the US immigration system and just by virtue of where they were born and the Presidents xenophobic policies, they are out of luck.  Millions of people have been displaced by conflict and civil strife in their country. Fleeing rampant violence, and hoping for a safer place to live, they apply through a stringent 2-year process which almost no one gets through, to come to the United States. Now Trump has put a 4-month halt on the entrance of any refugees from seven countries (conveniently, ones he does not have business interests in). Thousands may die in the coming months without the opportunity to search for a safer home. Again, just by virtue of being born in the wrong place at the wrong time, these refugees are out of luck. Where we are born, is ultimately the product of dumb luck. Yet that simple geographic feature determines the future of so many lives. Thats why it confuses me when some Americans tell immigrants to go back home, or work hard like the rest of us, or demand that the US government build a wall across the US-Mexico border. Thats why it disturbs me to no end that after just ONE WEEK in office, Trump has so drastically changed the policy of the administration towards people who are not American living in this country or trying to come here. Ive attached a picture from my citizenship ceremony almost two years ago. My parents will be taking their citizenship exams in the upcoming months. Even though Im incredibly excited at the prospect of having another 2 American citizens in the family, Ill always remember to support and champion those who didnt get the same lucky breaks along the way. Regardless of who sits in the oval office. I hope youll do the same. Columbine : white kids /  Aurora : white kid /  Tucson : white kid /  Isla Vista : white kid /  Charleston : white kid /  Sandy Hook : another white kid omg is this a trend?!? ( also has heavy white following calling it a hoax including Trump,which is the bigger tragedy?!? / 911 :15/19 terrorists from Saudi Arabia (are ally??) The ban is for 90 days - Do they think terrorism will be gone by then? I don't know what this is trying to solve (if anything) long-term.   I disagree with it regardless. These next 4 years are going to be very interesting.  My name is Ahmed Allen. I thought I was safe. As an international student I would complete my studies, then find a career of my own. Maybe get married, have children, start a life. But now our status as Americans are under attack, and Donald Trump would put an end to those dreams. We should have known the Republicans would turn on us, break the international order. They have no honor.  As an American, we want you to know that the majority(and growing) of us are just as disgusted, hurt, ashamed, and angry as you all are and we are fighting him. We will fight him until he is gone and we will never let this happen again. Please understand that he doesn't represent us. Our nation is turning more peaceful, accepting and compassionate. This is a nightmarish last gasp of the worst of us. The last fight of a dying party full of bigoted, racist, angry, insecure men. We are trying to kill it.    At some point, you will need to provide a counter-argument.  Look at the sort of political capital Trump can raise by invoking anti-Islamic sentiment in the USA. Now imagine how much more he could raise if the USA faced the threat level Europe does.  Look at Marine Le Pen, Viktor Orban, the far right on the march in countries as disparate as Poland and Sweden, all United by their distrust, their dislike of Islam - all heavily backed by their electorates.  Whether you like it or not, at some point soon, you will need to provide a counter-argument.  ""Politician keeps campaign promise, rest of the world loses collective shit.""  Well then.

Sure it will shut down the government but the bulk of these executive orders will require some type of legislative change. The sad thing here is that no the US will be in preservation mode rather then actually getting anything done. I just saw this today; Global Open Letter to Donald Trump  https://secure.avaaz.org/campaign/en/president_trump_letter_loc/  This is disgraceful, and not what the leader of the free world should do. Where are our real Leaders at? Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein are the politicians who seem to represent America, not the current Russian shill president trump.  Everyone ""omg he's banned people from 7 Muslim countries"" but if you do western things in their country you'll be arrested and fucked over by their backwards religious law.  Trump doesn't want America to have the problems Europe has. Denying people admission based on their origin, not just nationality, that's in 2017, the *leader of the free world* for you.    America has had no terrorism on our shores from the nations Trump chose. Trump and his cabinet have corporate /financial connections with the middle east nations that actually did . So they did not make the list. This whole thing is Trump stupidity.  Say nice things about me or help me make profit, and I will never harm you...Trump. The protestors look like cultists. Especially since  antifa is running their chants.  Title is misleading, out of the top 8 biggest populations of muslim countries in the world only one is on the list. **If you are angry about this policy then please, do yourself a favor and first read the actual text of the order:** http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/28/politics/text-of-trump-executive-order-nation-ban-refugees/  The media is working hard to make everyone angry about this and essentially undermine world peace by referring to this as a ""Muslim Ban"". The new presidential administration is calling for a 90-day halt to let the agencies review and establish the best procedures for vetting refugees. By the way, Trump is still accepting 50,000 refugees this year, not a dramatic decrease from the last 8 years.  Oh, what's this?  *(g) Notwithstanding a suspension pursuant to subsection (c) of this section or pursuant to a Presidential proclamation described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may, on a case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest, issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked.* [I'll just leave it here](http://i.imgur.com/0AUKjG3.png)  Source : /r/news/comments/5qrus7/comment/dd1remi Is it worth considering for one iota, that many folks are warming to him as they finally have their voices heard? I guess the popularity of the guy suggests that many folks simply don't want to have an increase in islam in that country. They live in a democracy, and if that's what people want, that's what they want. So I am deeply sorry that this hurts your agenda of appeasement and misplaced tolerance of the intolerant. People have had enough. It is obvious. The writing is on the wall, and support will only increase with each further islamic motivated act of terrorism and murder. Which let's face it, is probably just around the corner. Sadly. 1- September 11st: Saudis and Egyptians 2- Boston attack: Chechen origins 3- California massacre: Pakistanis and the woman was raised in Saudi Arabia  4- Florida massacre: Afghani origins while iraq which is the Frontline force and leading coalition ally in fighting ISIS is banned. here's a fun fact: no terrorist act was ever committed by an iraqi on U.S soil. as an iraqi that is really unfair. There is no way we will be able to get Trump out of office before his first term is up. Only Congress can do that, and with it full of republicans who only care about getting reelected themselves, it's almost impossible. Here's an international reaction for you Americans - I wish my country would simply place a ban on Muslim refugees too.  Islam is poison.  This absolutely was a muslim ban. Trump has been saying since last year that he wants to ban all muslim refugees. They knew there would be a huge backlash and legal issues, so they used this EO to raise the bar. There is no way they would be able to ban all muslims at once, but this was how they planned to start. If you want to boil a live frog, you don't turn up the heat to a maximum right away or the frog will jump out. You slowly raise the temperature and the frog doesn't notice the difference until it's too late.  It's truely amazing to me that this was even allowed to pass. Correct me if I am wrong but this executive order is violating TWO separate constitutional clauses the right of due process and equal protection and the establishment clause.  The First Amendment's Establishment Clause prohibits the government from making any law respecting an establishment of religion. This clause not only forbids the government from establishing an official religion, but also prohibits government actions that unduly favor one religion over another.  In this case he's favoring Christianity over Islam.  Equal Protection ""No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.""    now the world knows how hard liberals have been working in America to shelter everyone from republicanism.  The GOP are a hateful bunch and if you think war-mongering republicans were a bush family thing, you're dead wrong. Canada sure had a reaction.. this is none of the world's business. We don't complain when other countries have immigration issues. and America has the lightest immigration laws on the planet. so everyone needs to back off. We have the right to enforce our laws. if other countries are so upset about this, then how about THEY take in the immigrants? no? don't want to? thought so. now sit down and shut up the Boston Federal Court thread doesn't seem to be live You can tell Trump named it because it's not simply called ""Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry"". https://youtu.be/6cwrrMBtfKQ Videos in this thread:  [Watch Playlist &#9654;](http://subtletv.com/_r5quype?feature=playlist&nline=1)  VIDEO|COMMENT -|- [Your Child's called India](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwLhnZ7SjEQ)|[5](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5quype/_/dd2fxyb?context=10#dd2fxyb) - Oh god, that yoke would be working for the Daily Mail, what did I expect.

I've seen so many signs, comments, and or others that mention the fact that Several of Trump's wives are Foreigners, yes, they are but, not from the countries that he's banned from entering the U.S. Do I think he's wrong the ban? I think he is causing more chaos than good- I think so many families that have family from the countries being effected by the ban are going to be in great turmoil- Trump was voted into office by the American people nonetheless-  So I'm an Irish Italian American. And my family came here in the early 1900's. They were bootleggers, murderers, embezzlers, gangsters, and some of the most violent people you've ever met. My father, and my grandfather were the turning point, joining the USMC, and fighting in WW2, and Vietnam.  So my point is while the first people here may cling to their religion and crazy ideology eventually they will be assimilated, Americanized, and become another patch in the quilt of American society. You better watch out, you better not cry, war is coming to town.  If one person is more important than another, none of us are important.  Histories direct repetition before every major conflict engaged. Removing citizens in the area of conflict, and the enemy. Let's apply it back at home, because it paves the way for any groundwork.  It can be used to provoke the enemy into a response that then prompts which response.  Come on guys let's just argue patriotism, because if we are not equal trading partners, who are we selling our products to?   I love how they used the Canadian Mosque attack as an example to support the ban during the WH press conference, while didn't anything about the fact the attack was against Muslims  What's the latest with international spy agency digging up dirt about possible collusion between Trump and Putin leading up to the election? The worst part to me is that he made it retroactive, effective immediately. One of the main things about visas, especially green cards, is that they don't get revoked abruptly without good reason (think a terror attack or a criminal record). Who's going to want to have an office, host a convention, or open a hotel in the US when the president can revoke visas overnight without a reason? It might be constitutional, but it's horrible for business.  Here's some theories, have your pick. None too serious, so don't go believing them blindly  1) Bartering : Make your original proposal outrageous, so that the revised policy seems sensible in comparison  2) Distraction : Trump just gave Bannon a national Security Seat, while partially excluding the joint chiefs of staff and the director of national intelligence.  3) Incompetence Because the motherfucker issues executive orders without thinking them through. He literally has no idea how government or politics work. I think he thinks when he signs an order people will just somehow know what he wants done, instead of realizing that the order he just signed is what they'll obey, not his intentions. He still thinks he's the CEO who just tells people what to do and it gets done, never mind things like details and budgets.  > including t_d who just ignore my question or give the answer of 'well they shouldn't have left the country'  Huh, they just banned me.  T_d just ignored you? They banned me when I asked them about their hypocrisy.  Green Card issue has now been overturned  He lifted the green card ban. Source: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/jan/29/donald-trump-us-travel-ban-refugees-airports Almost the first thing he said on the campaign trail was ""a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the country"". I'm confused why people are surprised that's what he's gone for.  It's pretty much Bannon doing what he said he wanted to do. Bringing the system down. He's challenging the legitimacy of the constitution and our governments checks and balances system. He's winning, too. This is blatantly unconstitutional and neither the Executive branch or Congress are respecting federal court rulings. Our country is being compromised more and more literally every day  I don't understand it either and frankly I am disappointed and angry that he banned green card holders. I like a lot of stuff he's done. This, not at all.   Really hate to see America's international reputation getting dragged through the mud as well. Say what you will, but to this point, other powers like China or Russia being the dominant geopolitical force was terrifying for many countries. That stance is eroding, daily.  Imo, Trump is living in his own reality. When he talks about legal immigration he's actually talking about what *his* version of legal immigration is or *would be* (pretty sure he's making it up as he goes).   It looks like the POTUS is installing the seeds of the far right and his appointments only seem to confirm this. It's almost as if he doesn't have a clue what's he's doing himself.  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/29/us/politics/white-house-official-in-reversal-says-green-card-holders-wont-be-barred.html I guess it's the same reason he put a federal hiring freeze in place. It's a 90 day temporary ""solution"" to review all the policies and come up with a long term solution.  He obviously can't have a hiring freeze for ever like he can't have a immigration ban for ever. It's a temporary stop gag.  Republicans are incompetent, they can't even issue a stay on refugee immigration without fucking it up. Its a good question.  I personally think its either extreme incompetence or its the alt-right part of his advisors that pushed/implemented it.  Odds are its a mixture of the two. This sets a terrible precedent.   If green cards are no longer trustworthy, why would anyone agree to work in the US?   Why would anyone commit to signing an employment contract, renting a house, buying a car, opening a bank account if all of that can basically be dispossessed in an instant without notice?  Why would anyone employ a green card holder if they can't be sure they won't be deported tomorrow?  There is a case for strict immigration policies, but this has nothing to do with strict immigration policies. It's wanton recklessness, plain and simple. I think the only reason you could make for that is he was talking about Mexico illegal immigrants, nothing to do with Islamic terrorism.   The 7 states listed are treated more harshly because they are listed as sponsoring or safe havens for terrorism, thus the green card deal.   But, that's complete bullshit. The greencard thing is fucked up.  The green card ban just got lifted a couple of hours ago.  >Why did Trump ban those with a green card as well  He didn't proofread the order?  Who knows why Trump any of the things he does... I think he signed what Bannon put in front of him. Elicitting reaction? Treating the presidency as a game show? I mean, just spitballing here  Great question I have seen it reported that it doesn't apply to green card holders. Only if you are from one of the listed countries you are subject to ""additional screening"" (aimed at links to terrorism or significant criminal record.) Is this not the case?  I'm not defending it. Just trying to gather the facts. Is it TRULY a ""Muslim ban?"" No. Are green card holders now banned? I thought not but your post seems to say so.   Personally, I hate how I'm not Trump or leftist and everything seems slanted a bit from both sides.  Racism, my guy. Its pretty obvious nice terror attack today Canada ... It was not specifically written on the executive order. Just a quick update, they reversed that.  He just turned it back around. People with greencard can enter. http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-muslim-immigration-ban-reince-priebus-green-card-holders-visa-travel-warning-a7552041.html   the reason is manipulation.  People will find it less justified to protest en masse when the government supposedly went ""okay, you're right, here we'll allow the green card and legal residents back inside, okay?""  Making it seem as if the government gave way to demands, but in reality there is still the extremely fascistic, isolationist and discriminatory policy in place. > He has always said, in every speech I can find, that he supports legal immigration, and it was only illegal immigration that was to be targeted as well as refugees.  I think he generally emphasized this when talking about Mexico.  It's been more of a mixed bag with muslims.  After the San Bernardino shooting, he said we should ban all muslims from entering the country until we ""straighten this out.""  He did not specify whether he meant naturalized citizens, much less refugees and green card holders. Trump did nothing but reinstate an Obama Law for 90 days. ignore the fake news.  he didnt ban anyone with green card.   The reason is that people with green cards weren't banned but I was poorly implemented by enforcers  Interesting theory that i came across on this thread. .. makes sense, sadly. I predict this will be a repeated pattern:  ""you're not giving him enough credit.  The fucker knew what he was doing, it's a form of manipulation.  step 1: propose a completely outrageous policy.  step 2: wait until there is heavy protesting against said policy  step 3: ""soften"" your policy by removing the extra bits which you didn't want in the first place (allow legal residents and green card holder back in)  step 4: laugh maniacally as everyone just goes ""oh the government gave in, well that's that then"" and just forgets about the fact that there is still a completely unacceptable policy in place.""  We're now beginning to understand the green card ban was a distraction. He's creating the illusion of compromise by pulling back on something he never intended to keep. When looking at his actual announcement, in **Section 3** he explicitly exempts several types of visa holders from the ban. In **Section 9**, he calls into question the validity of current Visas and requested they be looked into again to make sure the paperwork is up to par. Not only that, but it appears to adjust visas to roughly match what the country of origin would offer American citizens (though I'm not a lawyer and may be misreading it)  My father has taken to watching all sorts of news on this stuff (more entertaining than Ancient Aliens, I suppose) and has explained that some of the countries don't have reliable paperwork to prove someone's identity, such as Syria which has been through quite a lot of strife. Take it all with a grain of salt and double check if you get the chance, I don't have sources and am getting ready for work so I'm running off hearsay with a healthy dose of skepticism. clearly he never read the piece of paper he signed, or thought about it. Doesn't his wife still have  Green Card?  They are now allowing green card holders to enter US. That was unpopular for even the Donald Trump supporters and has been rescinded. In my opinion, I think he's trying to provoke a terrorist attack. If something big happens, I mean 9/11 big. He will be able to use that to give himself much more power and increase the transformation into fascism.   Just watch out for when he is given 'emergency' powers.   This will also be the point at which the media will be able to start convincing people that people from these 7 nations are actually dangerous. And non trump supported will feel like the outsiders. At that point we are all fucked.  Pretty sure this just demonstrates the lack of thought behind his actions. Once he signed it his ego won't let him admit he didn't mean too The immigration ban does NOT effect green card holders.  http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-30/us-tempers-part-of-trump-travel-ban-amid-big-protests/8224352   Very good questions.  No one here has heard about this--it hasn't been in the news. The real question is will Trump be playable in the next expansion? and do you get The Wall as a national monument? This is what happens when you elect a meme as president. I think they'll be wondering why it didn't stop after he came down the escalator and gave his introductory speech.  This.  We think we won't allow history to repeat itself.  And anyone who suggests it can be is called naive.  But it so easily can. Americans grew bored with stability.   That's literally going to be the only remotely rational explanation in the future.    The flag is not all red. Don't forget the hammer and sickle.  Everyone has a resposibility in the comingn days to be passionate, loud and kind. We ust engage educate and be our own inspiration. How do you propose to stop him?  Did the Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 affect you at all? This may be an unpopular opinion and one that you will really have to think about is going to the Iranian embassy and renouncing your citizenship.  I do not understand Theresa May, I know that she has a lot of pressure domestically, yet having her ignore this issue really makes me question how she will be able to handle any sort of Brexit negotiations. If this means that for any political move she makes towards independence she has to call Trump, I really cannot believe that there will ever be a favorable ending for the UK. Trump is a religion of one, a person that should have never been made responsible for the fortunes of anyone other than himself, he has no intention in protecting the UK, unless it serves himself. I really hope the UK understands this, there will not be much help from across the pond.  Hopefully Europe has learned its lesson in appeasement.  Indonesia is the largest Muslim country in the world. How come he didn't ban that country? Hopefully a sniper and a good aim.  I'm pretty sure this is what Bannon, Trump's chief strategist, wants.  They want to sow the seeds of conflict so they can push policies that would otherwise not be possible.   And this whole immigration thing is a diversion too: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38787241    Pretty good summary. Islam sucks, but like people of other religions, most Muslims cherry pick what to follow or not follow, or they don't even practice the religion at all. Those are the people we are standing up for. Don't be scared nan.  The sun will come up tomorrow,  the world will keep spinning.  The more Trump upsets broad cross sections of society,  the more he guarantees he's a one term president.  This is what everyone is missing.  These are failed states that don't have a centralized government or Intel agency for us to coordinate with.  The first thing needed is to hold people in power accountable, and punish them as harshly as a ""normal"" person would be punished. No special prisons, no paltry fines that a company or individual can absorb in less time than the trial takes, no shortened sentences. They need to be stripped of their dignity as much as the average person would be and shown there are consequences when you fuck things up.   Already talking about interment camps... > If this is the Trump train, then how far will it go?  Far away from here, that's my hope at least. I really liked your comment. But better than Canada? That's not tenable any more. How is America still the best country? Cuz of freedom? Lots of countries have freedom. They get that even without a McXenophobe as their leader  Agreed, but to be fair we have done similar things to the Japanese and Germans in WWII.  At least we aren't throwing citizens in camps like with the Japanese... Yet. > This is purely unamerican and simply goes against our values.  [Except for](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1903) [the times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1907) [it happened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1917) [in the past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1918) Don't you wonder, if these countries are listed as sponsoring or safe havens for terrorism, they were allowed in to the country in the first place though?  I think what happened is that most Trump supporters knew he was crazy but also were losing jobs. Some are the crazy racist people you see on TV who go around shouting ""Wooo I can be racist again! Trump's in power"" But mos Trump supporters just want their jobs back, and as someone who spent time looking for a job, I can feel their pain.   The problem is when you vote based on a single issue, you vote for the entire package and so it comes back to bite them. It's same when you don't vote for a candidate. If you exclude Clinton because of e-mails, you exclude her entire platform. Poor education, that's how. The right has been pushing shitty public schooling for years so they could keep their core intact.  >but Trump tweet about muslims killing Christians in large numbers offended me to my very core.  Why did that offend you? Media and opposition. Mexicans again.  then Native americans.  Muslims again.  Poor people.  More brown people... It's not just Muslims, it's anybody born in any of those seven countries. I just read in a Norwegian newspaper that the Norwegian celebrity Aylar Lie is banned. She is about as far away from an Islamist that you can get. She is an atheist, ex drug addict, actress, pop singer:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKSbYZZHJ8U She is also an ex porn actress (NSFW): http://www.pornhub.com/pornstar/aylar-lie She was born in Iran, so she's on the list. >VOTE IN THE MIDTERMS.  I'll be sure to vote for all those who support this platform. >protest   Only in big cities. In my town of 60k nobody gives a shit, everyone goes on with their day to day duties. The closest protest to me is in Los Angles, which is about an hour away. I can't really waste gas or time going there to protest for 3 hours.    What about [today](https://i.reddituploads.com/3c76af773abf47cc89d80116056e6d65?fit=max&h=1536&w=1536&s=5e044326faced41041e5e055342e9eb9)? I saw this quote at the Holocaust Museum in DC, and it's always stuck with me. Anyone know who it's from? Next you'll tell me your country doesn't have different rules for every cafe. If we're lucky. The problem is that a lot of people see the religion of Islam as the hurdle to overcome... not the banning of Muslims.  If  you look at the ten worse countries in the world when it comes to education of women, women in the work force, etc., you'll see *just one certain religion* that seems to be associated.  Some see the religion as incompatible with modern western values.  Which begs the question, do we tolerate the religion in the name of diversity?  Do we make special rules for them?  Do we ban their immigration outright?  I don't think there are easy answers.  Everybody has their opinion and is *certain* their opinion is right. And they call names at the people who disagree with them.  But it is *not* an easy answer.    This masquerade of ""but can't we all just love each other?"" accomplishes nothing and downplays how very large the real issues are. I took a screenshot of this so I can reread it again. To be fair, everything is happening so fast, their bosses might not have informed them of the Federal Court Order. Unfortunately, the bottom worker gets shafted with the warning on their record, or fired so management can save face.   And of course now a day later the Administration reverses on part of the Executive Order. That's a good thing (and is a start in the right direction of reversing such a stupid Order), but at the same time the speed is going to cause a lot of confusion. You know, the muslims have the total opposite opinion on this matter. Since 9/11 their religion has been non stop bashed by the mainstream. The problem often in discussion about Islam is that it is highly inflammatory and often leads to justification towards violence and hate against Muslims. I for one, welcome your proposal but it useless if Muslims are not involved in this dialogue as well. The reason of course for their inclusion is that in response to criticism they can adapt their supposed ""ideology"" to western standards. Couldn't agree more. I also find it odd that no one sees the irony is blasting alternative facts and calling this the Muslim Ban when 90% of the world's Muslims we not subject to the order.   A more accurate name would be:   ""Countries the U.S. has been bombing via the drone program ban."" Why? Because Trump is doing business with them.  He said he would do it. If you helped get him elected, you're responsible for this decree. You know he's not bringing back those jobs, right? The list of countries are by reference to another legislation already in from the last goverment.  Trump's EO:  I hereby proclaim that the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. **1187(a)(12)**, would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of such persons for 90 days  The text of 1187(a)(12) from the Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015:  a country that is designated by the Secretary of State under section 4605(j) of title 50 (as continued in effect under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)), section 2780 of title 22, section 2371 of title 22, or any other provision of law, as a country, **the government of which has repeatedly provided support of acts of international terrorism**. Lol, go to The_Donald with this question, they don't even have an real answer for that. It's either:  * Saudis are now the good guys (no, serious, look at the_donald where they celebrate the Saudis for the no-flight zone). Can't make this shit up haha.  * ""We just invade the Saudis and take their oil later"". Even though that was previously ""misreported"" when Trump talked about invading for oil.  * Saudis don't send us refuges. Even though the order was against terrorists? Same reason Egypt and Turkey aren't on it.  Trump has businesses there.  It wouldn't be in his interests. The percentage refugees/native population is different between the US and e.g. Germany. The US applies a longer and effective vetting process. Refugee immigration can be more easily regulated in the US than in Europe. An immigration ban makes extremism in the affected countries worse. Less people from those countries will be safe and wealthy, less will be making business with the United States, less will be able to make careers in the US that possibly help the economy. It makes intelligence and military relationships with banned countries worse. No one presented a *significant*, measurable decrease of the probability of US civilians to be killed in a terrorist attack, which would make this ban and affection of so many people's lives morally and economically worth it. The US has a moral responsibility due to its involvement in the Middle east.  Delivering on a promise that tens of millions of Americans voted for. The headlines need to be revised. The problem isn't Trump. Trump didn't ban Muslims. Americans did. America is a nation of hyper-paranoid, xenophobic, ethnocentric (look it up), small-minded fools that have zero issue being lied to and willingly voted for a wall and Muslim ban. Bravo fucktards. You're a laughing stock. The rest of the world will carry on and you'll self-immolate. Good riddance.  Oh god, that yoke would be working for the Daily Mail, what did I expect. Shes the fool who said its lower class and tacky to name your child after a location and not 30 seconds later tried to defend calling her daughter [India](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwLhnZ7SjEQ). It's a little buried in some other threads, but the reason for the list is that its from a legislation passed during the last goverment that deemed those countries goverments as supporters of terrorism.   Trumps EO:  I hereby proclaim that the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of such persons for 90 days  The text of 1187(a)(12) from the Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 refers to:  a country that is designated by the Secretary of State under section 4605(j) of title 50 (as continued in effect under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)), section 2780 of title 22, section 2371 of title 22, or any other provision of law, as a country, **the government of which has repeatedly provided support of acts of international terrorism.** now people are speculating that this might have been an intentional delay to soften the blow of the other bans. They've already repealed their repeal again.   http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-immigration-greencard-idUSKBN15C0KX  While greencard holders aren't summarily banned, they still require additional screening and might be refused entry. Unfortunately, they absolutely do not have the guts to do that. If they tried, Republicans will start saying they are being divisive, obstructionist, wasteful, partisan,etc (even though these are the exact things THEY have been under Obama), and the dems would give up and run back into their corners immediately. Yep, European here. Immigration has fucked my country and its scary to even leave the house. You are lucky you have someone trying to do something about it. What the fuck do people believe is happening in Europe? The major issue I have is that he had banned legal citizens and immigrants from entering. What kind of western things?  Obama picked 7 countries to suspend the Visa Waiver Program, which allows nationals from certain countries to come to the US for 90 days without a visa.  He did not, and was completely opposed to, a total ban on immigration from those countries, which is what this Executive Order does.  There is a world of difference between not being able to come to the US without a face-to-face interview for a visa, and not being able to come to the US for the sole reason that you are a national of a certain country. Neither faction in Yemen's civil war have any interest in attacking the United States.  Al-Qaeda and ISIS mostly exist in the country's eastern region where hardly anyone lives.  There is no risk associated if you apply common sense.   Well, the Department of Defence defined the ""countries of concern"" last year, not Obama.  But ya.  https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/158/text  Obama managed that in 2011 when he created this law.  Maybe it's time for them to stop mooching off us I think Obama homeland security debt made that list...  So there's that.  Muslim majority country means that a majority of the people in that country are Muslims.  I'm upset about the policy because it impacted lawful permanent residents.  If the administration was so worried about LPRs committing attacks they'd be worried about the thousands who are in the US right now from those 7 countries and not just the ones on planes trying to come back home.    This is not to say I want them to deport all Green Card holders from those 7 countries, I'm merely pointing out that this was about making life difficult for certain people and hoping they could get away with it.   Can't let the truth get in the way of a good news story... Even if that is true, the State Department wasn't the one that recommended this ban, a ban on Muslim majority nation immigration was literally part of his campaign promises from a year ago. Why did you screenshot instead of just linking to the comment so people could actually read the source? I'll just leave this here(taken from your source).  >Do you know what VWP is? To simplify, only 38 countries benefit from VWP and most of them are europeans. I get the point that these countries were removed by the obama administration from the list of allowed to come to the US without a visa - yes arrive in the US without a visa - but don't forget that over 100 countries are not in the VWP including Saudia and Egypt and Pakistan. By the way, I am an immigrant and although I hated going through that visa application and interview I think it is fair and respectful. Edit1: I'm grateful for the gold whoever gave that, also for some years I have been on reddit this is the highest up-vote and first. Edit2: I stand corrected, these countries were not removed from VWP, but rather people who benefited from VWP and visited these countries will have to go through demanding visa like other nationalities not included in VWP.  >The 7 countries (Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria, Libya, Somalia and Yemen) never were part of the Visa Waiver Program. The order under Obama restricted people from the 38 VWP (Western Europe, Australia, Chile, etc.) countries who had traveled to those 7 countries any time after March 2011. From the CPB website: Travelers in the following categories are no longer eligible to travel or be admitted to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP): Nationals of VWP countries who have traveled to or been present in Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria, Libya, Somalia and Yemen on or after March 1, 2011 (with limited exceptions for travel for diplomatic or military purposes in the service of a VWP country). Edit: For further clarification the Visa Waiver Program allows citizens from the select 38 countries to travel to the US on a 90 day tourism visa with little hassle(online form, nominal fee). I am piqued your by your choice of words, seeing you used the word appeasement. In all honesty, how are we appeasing Muslims?  > Is it worth considering for one iota, that many folks are warming to him as they finally have their voices heard?  There are a lot of Trump supporters that are regretting their votes. His support is declining. His approval rating is shit and his executive orders are a circus show.  What makes you think people are warming to him? You are more likely to die choking on a ham sandwich than to be killed by an Islamic terrorist.  Things that kill more Americans each year than terrorists:  * Bath tubs * Lawn mowers * Buses * Lightning  This is not the will of the people. It's the will of an angry, intolerant subset of the population getting organized and beating out a poorly selected opponent. The popular vote suggests this, as does the growing blowback from this week's orders.  It'll swing back hard the other way in 2020, and we'll probably swing back again after that. Actually, if they care about being re-elected, they might want to start thinking about how they can get rid of this Russian patsy who is running the country now. No mention of the word Muslim in EO. If Muslim ban, why not include Indonesia in the list of banned countries? Those constitutional laws only protect citizens... The people affected here are NOT citizens. That makes the order legal and valid. If I was a LPR from one of these countries impacted, even if I was sympathetic to conservative politics, once I became a citizen and could vote I'd never vote for a Republican.   Exactly, Dubai and Saudi Arabia residents are basically shitting gold and they get pissed when we restrict the borders, and americans are mad about this?!?! >[**Immigration World Poverty and Gumballs 2010 - Immigration Doesn't Work [6:08]**](http://youtu.be/6cwrrMBtfKQ)  >>Global humanitarian reasons for current U.S. immigration are tested in this updated version of immigration author and journalist Roy Beck's colorful presentation of data from the World Bank and U.S. Census Bureau. The 1996 version of this immigration gumballs presentation has been one of the most viewed policy presentations on the internet.  > [*^NotSleepingAnymore*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuE8RCTuxGtjVxpQRko5uXQ) ^in ^Education  >*^25,104 ^views ^since ^Jan ^2011*  [^bot ^info](/r/youtubefactsbot/wiki/index) I thought [article 1, section 9, clause 1](http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/63/ex-post-facto) of the US Constitution would apply to someone holding a [green card](https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/after-green-card-granted/rights-and-responsibilities-permanent-resident/rights-and-responsibilities-green-card-holder-permanent-resident).  This should be immediately challenged.  The government is required to demonstrate proof on a per person basis, or green card holders must be allowed to freely enter the country.     Canadian here. We don't do this sort of thing. We are open for business. Please open your offices here, hold your conventions here, visit and spend your money here. We're friendly, we're in the same time zones, and we're pro trade.  Edit: Thanks, stranger! I felt I was maybe being a bit too boosterish, but glad you liked my message. Probably one of those things when trump said he would not let his enemies know what he's going to do next.  Surprise! This is the even bigger issue.  No matter what Trump does now, no matter how much he promises and assures the world that green card holders and visa holders will be allowed entry people won't believe him.  He did it once, the risk of him doing it again is enough to dissuade foreigners from coming to the United States for school, work, or asylum.  Just the risk of being detained, not knowing what's happening, being held in fear is enough to convince a large percentage of would-be travelers from stepping on a plane.  This act, even if it gets repealed today, will have lasting consequences and will cause real irreparable damage to the country and geopolitics as a whole. 4) he doesn't believe there will really be a reaction, as in real consequences you're not giving him enough credit.  The fucker knew what he was doing, it's a form of manipulation.  step 1: propose a completely outrageous policy.  step 2: wait until there is heavy protesting against said policy  step 3: ""soften"" your policy by removing the extra bits which you didn't want in the first place (allow legal residents and green card holder back in)  step 4: laugh maniacally as everyone just goes ""oh the government gave in, well that's that then"" and just *forgets* about the fact that there is still a completely unacceptable policy in place. It's not even Trump, it's Bannon pulling the strings. Trump has no constitutional knowledge, he probably doesn't know how Executive Orders work or what their limits are. > Because the motherfucker issues executive orders without thinking them through. He literally has no idea how government or politics work  I'm actually  more cynical. I think he knows and the whole ""I support legal immigration"" is the oldest dog whistle in the book  Agree. Literally everything he's done so far has been quickly and poorly conceived. These are things that *most* administrations would work on for an extended period of time, so that all possible outcomes are considered.   Pretty sure Bannon and Giuliani thought it through.  The ban stirred up his base and he did what he promised. Then he walks it back after screwing with everyone.  What harm was done to him exactly?   Do the scum who support him still support him? Probably more so.  Do the people who already don't support him hate him more? It doesn't matter. You sue, he settles. The man has spent a life time in court and evading penalties, he understands how to abuse power.  It's like Umbridge's Educational Decrees in Harry Potter. Did you even read his executive order? The answer is no otherwise you just didn't understand it. It's because at heart he doesn't want Muslims here. He wants this country to be white Christian American business owner dominated and he fears all people of different colors or creeds. Lol, they spam everywhere that it's Obama's fault for having this country list for the visa program. And then Obama just sneaked into the oval office and forced Trump to write and sign the order and also pressure the DHS to enforce it even for greencard holders.  EDIT: Inb4 Obama's secret muslim powers are the reason! T_D is a 24/7 Trump rally, if you want to discuss policy go here: r/AskTrumpSupporters/ T_D is a 24/7 Trump rally, if you want to discuss policy go here: r/AskTrumpSupporters/ ...Supposedly, anyway. It seems that their solution is to wave in anyone that has a green card, rather than change the executive order itself. In other words, there's no promises that they'll keep it up. ...apart from the Muslims in the countries where he has business interests, even if they were complicit in 9/11.  ie. Saudi Arabia. Metaphorically its like having ancient city defenses in medieval times and always relying on them to deter the raiding barbarians if they ever come - ""Naaah, we are not afraid of the raiders, our defenses are strong and they have no way how to overcome them"".   And then the raiders actually come, run over the defenses like they are nothing or they are in fact so deteorriated (or noone knows how to use them properly) that they cause them no harm at all.    Thats basically whats happening with US's gov system right now and trump / bannon are the raiders. Our reputation was being dragged through the mud during the whole campaign as the world slowly realized we might elect a 70 year old reality show billionaire as president.  What is happening now is Trump is basically removing the ""huddled masses"" plaque from the statue of liberty and taking a giant shit on it.  He doesn't have a clue what's he's doing.   FTFY The idea that he(or his backers) does and it's all planned is far more worrying to me. >On Saturday night, the **Department of Homeland Security said** that Mr. Trumps order **did apply to green card holders** who were traveling to the United States from the seven countries affected.   --  >Mr. Priebus appeared to change that position Sunday morning. As far as green card holders**, moving forward,** it doesnt affect them, he said on NBCs Meet the Press program.  http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/316670-trump-refugee-ban-bars-green-card-holders-report  http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-immigration-greencard-idUSKBN15C0KX  Yep. Here ya go: http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-29/turnbull-and-trump-talk-about-refugee-resettlement-deal/8220824  Next election is suppose to feature, Ron Perlman, Kanye West, Dwayne Johnson, and possibly Joe Biden. I don't care what trump's meme level is, no one can stand up to such a force. I guess this is also what happens, when you don't vote at all...  (as 90 Million eligible US citizens seemingly decided to do)   You defend democracy by participating not by abstaining and let it become democrazy... And shameless politicians who put party over country. ""Americans"" generally refers to the people.  The people of this country did not get board.  I know you say it as a joke, but in reality, Americans are getting screwed by their parties, both of them and by big business.  Every business, agency or branch of government is out to get every time out of you that they can.  Even the police have started robing the citizens they were intended to protect.  No, BORED?  NO, I AM NOT BORED.  I am truly feeling it might be about time to revolt to get the system back to where it has strayed from. Why would that affect him?  That suspended the visa waiver program, which only meant that people from certain countries could come to the US without a visa.  The people that come in without visas generally aren't even seeking to immigrate - the purpose is largely for business and recreation.  What Trump has enacted is entirely different. It meant people that have visited Iran need a visa to travel to the US, so it would make some people he knows lives slightly less convenient.  It wasn't a travel ban. So long as other countries don't make it reciprocal, which they haven't yet, we aren't directly affected. It does affect our relatives though. I have not considered doing this at all. I have no shame about my background nor do I think renouncing my citizenship will benefit me at all. I'd love to hear what you think I can benefit from by doing this. Iran doesn't allow revocation, which is why this ban fucked over a lot of people who were ""Iranian"" in the loosest sense but had zero ties with the country. There could be.  Parts of Trump's government have said that they dislike the entire idea of the EU. They may want to give the UK a good deal, because they want it to succeed because they want the EU to fail. May's approach with Trump is sensible for Britain - she's got the Eurocrats rattling their sabres and trying to make Brexit painful for the UK, so she needs some strength and support from the US to show that we have economically powerful nations with us. Her spokesperson and that idiot Boris have both spoken out against Trump's exec order on immigration, but given what she has to deal with in Europe, she'd be foolish to go all in against Trump on this, as wrong-headed as we all think he is. Whom are we appeasing, this man is only Ego. We appease him he continues, we go against him he feels himself as the victim.  300 million+ peaceful Indonesians makes their ""Muslims is evil"" theory seem obviously untrue. So they try to completely ignore it.  Didn't the dude overrule the DHS' decision to exempt green card holders from the ban? If true that's just a clear red flag this man's alignment is chaotic. There seems to be a disconnect here.  If the politicians are 'pushing' policies that go against the people, presumably they do so in the name of power/money.  Just what would they government be like if the politicians could enact just about any laws they wanted.  Is the actual goal of the government to suppress the people so far that the people no longer have any freedom because they can't afford it.  Does the politians search for more money drives them to suppress their fellow American so far that they can barely survive.  If you, the politian, had free reign to change America, what would you change it into?  Hopefully you should see how far off base we are already yet you, the politicians, continue to drive the people into the ground.  Why? A full term? Let's hope it doesn't come to that. I'd like to know where it's being talked about too.  If trump has done anything for me, it's getting me to become politically aware. Next step is involved. Where at? Hadn't seen mention of this since before the election.  When people say America (or any other country) is the best country in the world, I just interpret it in the same way I interpret when I see or hear people telling their mom that ""they have the best mom in the world"". It's cute, but hey lets not kid ourselfs. We all know my mom is the best one in the world ;) From my perspective, America is the best country in the world if you are a highly skilled and educated professional but it's shit for the average joe.  Because America controls the Sea.   You control the seas you control the world. It makes it more agregious that we have done this before because it shows that we haven't learned. Sometimes the only positive that can come from horrors of the past is learning and not repeating them.  To be fair, you've been locking up Muslims without giving them a fair trial for quite some time now. Agreed. That is why we must stop history form repeating itself. ...... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp We're a pretty fucked up country historically speaking. As recently as 1913 we we're passing laws to steal land from Asian-Americans. I agree, but that doesn't mean we have to do it again. The people that voted for him because of jobs are going to be in for an awful surprise when it becomes obvious that Trump can't bring back manufacturing jobs that don't exist anymore due to automation, and that protectionism will slow the economy. Just like the Germans just wanted their jobs back...  They didn't just want jobs, they wanted jobs that their lazy, dumb asses didn't have to work hard for. They just want a high paying factory job to fall into their laps and for them to do nothing more than push a button all day like a human robot when that's **never fucking coming back!**.   ""Oh but education and proper training is too expensive for these poor rednecks"" one might say, and maybe that's true, but then why the hell did they turn around and vote for someone who will do nothing to make education and training more affordable? It's because they're lazy both physically and intellectually.  Metrolink is a hell of a service, my friend. >If you look at the ten worse countries in the world when it comes to education of women, women in the work force, etc., you'll see just one certain religion that seems to be associated.  There is huge flaw in your argument. Decades ago, places like Syria and Iran would be barely indistinguishable from 60's/70's America. Muslim women attended college could dress as they like, worked. Seriously, they wore mid-thigh skirts and low cut dresses and shirts, bikinis and everything.  They were Muslim back then, but they didn't have the problems they do *now*. What happened was that extremism and corrupt governments took over, instability rose in the area - instability that *we*, America, played a part in.  Islam is totally compatible with Western culture. Just as Judaism and Catholicism and Christianity is. It's extremism, in any of those religions, that is incompatible. You don't think Judaism and Christians had their own extremists and terrorists?  >If  you look at the ten worse countries in the world when it comes to education of women, women in the work force, etc., you'll see *just one certain religion* that seems to be associated.  Can you provide this list for me? Aslan once mentioned that the country with the highest rate of female genital mutilation is Eritrea, which is Christian.  Interesting perspective. I totally see what you're saying. Yes, these issues aren't just solved with ""let's love one another."" I was just kind of venting. But I mean, I think we all have a role to play and it can be as simple as getting to know your community members better and interacting more and more with them to build bonds of friendship and love. Fundamentally, love, respect, and unity will grow out of such actions.  As you said though, there are no easy answers. Thanks for your input.  > You know, the muslims have the total opposite opinion on this matter. Since 9/11 their religion has been non stop bashed by the mainstream.  So please tell me, in predominant muslim countries, how are women being treated? How are children being treated? How are christians being treated? How are homosexuals being treated? How are atheists being treated? How are all other kinds of people being treated?   Give me a fucking break with Islam. Islam is a cancer to the western world. If we keep tolerating intolerance, our societies will lie in ruins very soon.

Open to that Saudi oil money I see. Can't blame you Unless you are some sort of immigration official, this comment is valid - otherwise, it worth nothing other than saying that Canadians are friendly (which I have no reason to believe otherwise)  We Americans are also against what is happening now and we welcome everyone and anyone here in the US. This is the government doing it, not the American people.  The reason I am saying this is that a friend of mine - who happens to have brown skin - was on transit form the US to France via Toronto.  Canadians immigration officers questioned him for one hour and let him waiting on second screening for almost 3 hours.  He did have a ticket showing all the flight information, had never been arrested, is a US Citizen, and just happen to get a cheaper flight through Canada. He said he would never flight to or through Canada again.  Again, just to reiterate my point - we Americans are welcoming and a great people - we just happen to have a horrible policy right now with this administration.   How's that working out for you? One day and your shits being shot up by terrorists lol. Keep em. We don't need em. We don't want em.  Canada actually has a pretty strict immigration policy as well...so people might want to check out if they are even eligible to enter Canada. It's a sinking feeling being a citizen of the US and reading this. This is not going to be a well transition. ""Please come and fuck my wife as well"" This is what happens because he watches too much TV. He has no understanding of consequences. Each time he suffers any kind of consequence, note that he immediately starts tweeting that it is ""unfair"". Wahhhh. Poor him.  Most adults know about consequences. Not him.  Surely most of those that voted for him will be delighted about those policies remaining?  He may or may not know what their limits are.  He's been pushing the envelope non-stop and the push-back has been too weak. He's breaking all kinds of precedents, and it seems no-one has the power to stop him. Or if they do, they don't dare/want to flex it.  There's probably a fair bit more to all this than just ""haha he's stupid"". There's a concerted non-stop flood of information trying to spread fear uncertainty and doubt. It doesn't stop. He goes from one big act to the next, and there's no breaks to resolve the last one. That's exactly one of the biggest reasons his supporters supported him. He doesn't wait around and kick stones to maybe see if it's a ""good"" plan or not. Granted, the repercussions of a bad plan are significantly worse as POTUS than as a CEO, he is efficient. Whether that destroys the world or not is to be seen still. I, and it appears many others on Reddit, seem nothing good comes from ""fire, aim, ready"". Any idea who is legal team is? no thx why are Pakistan scot free? Your reputation was being dragged through the mud since Vietnam. Since then it has been a steady downfall. Not sure if change in policy or this rollout was a clusterfuck and there was confusion amongst agents, DHS, and the White House about whether it applied to green card holders. I don't know man, I just saw the question and remembered a post in r/news Damn, Aus is fucked up too.. That's pretty inhumane if you ask me, at least Dump would send them back where they came from. So, if Biden runs for president, can he pick Obama as his VP?  ~star wars comes up with a palpatine movie imagine Kim K as a first lady As it ever occurred to you that this just might be what your country wants? Democracy has flaws you know. Plato even predicted that democracy would give rise to tyrants. Even with 100% voter turnout the results would probably have been the same, hillary won the popular vote after all. I'm not American so I'm genuinely curious, is it true hardship or perceived hardship?  Sure, there has been a massive financial crisis in 2008, however, by the numbers, the economy seems to be back on track again (unemployment figures for example).  Compared to say 30 years ago, is it really that much more difficult to find a job and pay for non-luxury living expenses? Since he's Iranian it means that his family members can no longer come to this country anymore. That's a pretty big deal, My Norwegian and Canadian family can come and visit me whenever they want because they have a skin tone that president Bannon approves of. Of course they dislike the EU. One of its core drivers is to create an economic zone that is competitive with the US.   Competition is NOT something the US government actually likes.  >    This is true! Not ignoring the fact that given her sketchy record as Home Secretary she's also quite likely to be one of the more sympathetic leaders to the ban  Well Theresa may is pretty intent on kissing Trump's puckered little mouth-anus. Most of the electoral base of the AfD are protest voters, because of the refugee crisis and their fear of personal economic and social decline. Before the AfD was founded, they voted for CDU (center-right, conservatives) or SPD (center-left, social democracy). Not all of those 15% of the Germans are racist. They know the AfD wont be in a government coalition, so they hope they can teach the ""Altparteien"" (old parties) a lesson.   Now with the nomination of Martin Schulz as the chancellor candidate of the SPD, the AfD is already losing voters in the polls. Martin Schulz is on domestic politics an outsider and can convincingly deliver a message of change for those who feel left behind.   The coming election campaign will be very suspenseful. But I believe the right-wing populists already reached their zenith. Typical German: perfect English, and worries about the tiny details :)  I manage a terribly pronounced ""good morning"" in German and strut around like a professor You're English is fine, maybe you can help me with my admittedly terrible German however. But you're right though.  As a german, how do you feel personally about the policy to allow so many refugees into Europe?  I would love to hear your perspective on the past 2 years. Apparently Giuliani got on Fox and claimed to have been the architect of Trump's ban. Then he went off into talking about ""Detention centers"".   I think he means the rumour he may call for a review that could lead to CIA black site prisons. It's just a maybe right now,  but really who knows.  https://www.google.co.uk/amp/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN15922L?client=safari   Why? This ban affects those highly skilled individuals you're speaking about as well. You can be a highly skilled professional in another country and not have to worry about your family being denied entry or having your citizenship revoked (which is the next step in all this). Egregious, not agregious.   But I agree with you. It makes it worse Only way to conceivably do this is... Bear arms.  That isn't the same as, or anywhere near, rounding up everybody from an Islamic majority nation in our boarders and throwing them in camps. It still doesn't negate my point that this isn't unamerican.   Um... have you every worked with your hands in a factory line? You know how dangerous and dehumanizing they are?  Not saying you're wrong about the loss of jobs to technology, but your contempt for those less fortunate than you make you sound like some entitled kid who never worked a day in their life. I'm not paying 26 dollars and wasting 3+ hours protesting in LA I think the words written down in the Quran are *very* different than those written down in the New Testament (both religions consider the old testament a secondary holy source).  I think the fact that Muhammad spent his entire adult life conquering the infidel (while Jesus spent his adult life preaching peace and charity) makes the situation *much* different.  While Islam was in it's infancy, it conquered from Spain to India.  Let's also add that according to Hadiths that 90% of Muslims believe in, Muhammad consummated his wedding to a 9 year old wife.  And what the Quran says about women.  Now lets compare that.  Muhammad spent his entire adult life conquering the infidel (compare that to Jesus) and had sex with a 9 year old (compare that to Jesus).  Remember, both religions consider the old testament holy to a degree, but obsolete.  So overall, I think your argument is silly.  But let's just say that I did buy the argument that (lol) all religions are ""equally peaceful"" regardless of what words are written in their holy books.  Let's pretend all religions go through equally violent horrible times.  So let's look at 16th century Christianity, where they were burning ""witches"" at the stake and doing all that psychotic shit.  Would you blame the rest of the world for *not wanting* Christian immigration to their country at the time?  So even if I accept the lying narrative that all religions are equally peaceful (lol), but Islam is just going through a ""bad time"", are we not allowed to say ""until you fix your shit, you're no longer welcome?"" You sure about that? Countries around the world are banding together and speaking out against the USA over its abject stupidity. At some point, Americans need to recognize that going it alone is a quick and certain path to ruin. Perhaps it's too late for an about-face and hitting rock bottom is inevitable. Either way, the rest of us are watching America nosedive while wondering how you could have gotten it so painfully wrong.  62 million Americans got off their obese asses and stood in line to choose the course that's unfolding as I type. People signed-on for four years of  lies,l and deceit and signalled to the globe that this is what Americans are. I don't want people with these values in Europe  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/07/iran-executes-men-homosexuality-charges It took me 5 minutes of scrolling to finally get to a credible intelligent post.

Turkey seems to like him? > None of those things you listed are trying to bring a dirty bomb into the US.  We have existing measures that make this a difficult proposition. We will never eliminate the threat entirely, but there an infinite number of things that are more worrisome than some vague threat that we are already doing what we can to protect against.  You _could_ get hit by a bus randomly while you are on a sidewalk, but does this make you fear sidewalks enough to never use them? Probably not.  Also, the dirty bomb would just be smuggled in via different means or from one of the countries not covered by the Muslim ban. If someone wants to cause destruction, they've got all kinds of different ways to do it.  The focus should be on not creating _more_ extremists, which is what this executive order will do.  > While yes, there are things that most likely will kill you, look at the attack 9/11. Three thousand people died, many more are dying from related diseases, the world economy went into shock and millions went into rebuilding the area.  I'm very glad you brought this up. The country who played one of the biggest parts (Saudi Arabia) in 9/11 is not in the current Muslim ban. If our true goal is to stop a repeat 9/11, seems like this absurd measure should have included the prime evil. But it does not, since that isn't the goal at all.  Let's call this executive order what it is: Ineffective pandering to his base. This will not reduce the already miniscule threat that terrorism poses to this country. It's politics by fear and sensationalism. We shouldn't be giving up our liberties and core tenants in response to outside threats. That's as un-American as a nation of immigrants closing its gates. That is the norm now for loser of Presidential election to win mid term elections. It will take candidates that people believe will really change things to turn this around. Otherwise there won't be any change.  Democrats also need to stop putting so much emphasis on the Presidential elections and focus on local and national elections.  Having a ""pageantry"" style party doesn't fix the fundamental issues with the Democratic party.  If they want to win they need to start focusing on the states and stop always focusing on the federal.

That is by far the easiest - you can apply right at the border and its instant.  If that isn't an option, the regular stream assesses you on points for things like language skills, education, and age. If you get enough points, and pass all the screening, you will eventually get permanent residency. It takes at least a couple of years. If you find an employer willing to sponsor you, there is a also a ""provincial nominee program"" that allows a limited number of people to jump to the front of the line.  The political climate is much, much more progressive at the moment. Our Prime Minister describes himself as a feminist, we take in quite a few refugees, marijuana legalization is on the doorstep, etc. Some people like that, some don't, I guess.  I'd recommend you visit and see what you think. Our cities are very safe and very cosmopolitan, and our outdoors are legendary. As an American, its also quite affordable, given the pounding our dollar has taken lately. Please stay and fight for your country. If all of the good people leave the US the whole world is screwed. Be Brave. Depends where you are moving from.   Edit: as for different or better. Well that's kinda up to each person's experience and preferences. Personally I like it here a lot more than the USA. But I've also never lived there just visited so I'm not the best measure. We're a lot more tolerant overall and violence to crime is a fraction of what it is down there. In fact if I remember correctly Canada sits around 10 places above the USA on last year's quality of life index. It's often the same weather as Buffalo, NYC, Boston and Michigan get. In fact, here in Toronto it's often much more mild than Buffalo.  We didn't get that massive snow storm last year, for example.  It's true that parts of Canada are insanely cold, like Winnipeg and the prairies, but the same can be said about the northern US and Alaska.  Overall it's not so different because we mostly live on the border anyways. I live in Vancouver. Our weather is just about exactly like Seattle. Crappy rainy weather. Great for skiing, though. It's not that bad depending on where you're from in the States and where you're living in Canada. Northern US can be much worse than Toronto and Vancouver (two of the most populous cities).  Obviously if you're from California or something it's a bit of a shock.  Some parts of the country have a surplus of teachers at the moment, but that changes pretty constantly and is very regional. There is always a demand for people willing to teach on first nations reserves and in the north, but those aren't everyone's cup of tea.  I am guessing the market for mechanics is pretty good. If you were going to set up your own shop, for instance, there are special programs for people that want to start businesses. Two years ago, the market would have been fantastic, particularly in the oil and gas producing regions. That has slowed down substantially, but things will turn around eventually. Tech is booming. The largest hubs are Kitchener-Waterloo, Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Salaries are lower than the US, but quality of life is great. There are special programs to facilitate immigration in that sector, including the extremely easy NAFTA visa for engineers and software developers. If you check out Indeed for any of those cities, you'll see hundreds to thousands of listings.  The government is investing heavily in R&D and innovation, so I suspect that sector is pretty good, also. There was an attack in a mosque, yes. At least one of the shooters is white and has a quebecois last name, but, hey, lets jump to conclusions. To enter Canada as a tourist or for business is generally very straight forward.  For immigration it ranges from extremely easy (US residents with eligible qualifications on a NAFTA visa) to moderately difficult (offer of employment under the provincial nominee program), to very difficult (economic class immigrant under the points program). It also possible to get a student visa to study in Canada, which in some cases can lead to permanent residence, and young people from some countries can visit under the ""working holiday"" program (this is how all the Australians work in Banff and Whistler).  There is a also a very controversial temporary foreign worker program, for jobs where the employer certifies Canadians can't be found to fill the position (moderately easy once the employer has been approved), and a couple of programs for investors and entrepreneurs.  In total, around 300,000 immigrants are admitted a year from all sources, excluding the TFW program. It happens because he's never known anything in life other than ordering others around and having everyone else bail him out of his mistakes.   He's the very definition of privilege.  But there haven't been consequences.  Him not divesting is kinda going out of the news due to this.  I think the russian hacking is also losing attention.  Before there are consequences for this, he'll probably have the next big thing.  He never had consequences during his run as a ceo either. Banruptcy left and right, cheating contractors. Somehow he's always avoided consequences. but whats gonna happen, he's the president, president can sign executive orders,   to get removed, lawfully, the senate or house of congress has to impeach him, i think maybe the courts can restrict what he does, every single person in reddit could hate him and it doesn't matter, he's in the WH for the next four years With all due respect, and I do understand where you're coming from in the sense of he doesn't drag his feet, but efficiency is not just a matter of speed.  I don't think it's a good idea to overlook the ridiculous outcomes of his executive orders and say that 'he's efficient', because he isn't. He just says ""I want muslims banned"", someone runs off to write up the necessary documents with relatively little research into the scope of what their writing and he signs it with devastating outcome.  Efficiency should be reserved for plans well though out, well structured, and fast. Efficiency is not running headlong into a wall. Because his supporters are authoritarian.  Most of the ""why can't it just get done"" questions could be answered if they spent a weekend binging on the basic functions of government instead of a new Netflix show.   They'd know why a bureaucracy exists (and is 100% needed to a degree).   There's a certain amount of red tape that's there to prevent bullshit like today.    But instead we vote for authoritarian asshats who promise to cut through the bureaucracy not understanding that things like this are exactly what you get when that happens.  ***Efficiency does not mean leap without looking.***  ***Efficiency does not mean a lack of foresight.***  ***Efficiency does not mean making unforced errors.***   He just created a huge mess that will take months to resolve, had they thought this through for a couple of more weeks, probably could have been avoided. They are experienced in making small, relatively simple deals and transactions. Guess what, motherfucker's in charge of the beast now, with all of his experience worth shit. The only transferable skills new Presidents bring to the table are soft skill like leadership, patience, and their general personal characteristics.  If you make something effective immediately and retroactively with no warning you guarantee a cluster fuck.   *Nothing* gets done immediately in a bureaucracy as big as Customs.   People need time to receive and digest information and figure out implementation logistics.  *Legal residents* found out about this *mid flight*.  This is 100% all on Trump, there is no one else to blame.   Why not both?   Seemed as if they were holding some people back simply because they were brown. Well jeez, no point in doing a bit of critical thinking and forming your own opinion or anything.  No he cannot. 12th Amendment states that only people eligible to be presdent can be vice president. Since Obama is not, as he's already serve his two terms, Biden can't choose him. Non American here. I don't think so, as one of his jobs is to be a possible future president.  And he'd say ""Michelle would kill me"".  The wording that established the term limit could be construed as only applying against being *elected* as president, not necessarily as against succession. The coasts have recovered ok, but the mid-west, and central parts, especially the rural areas, have not seen as much of a recovery. This is in part due to manufacturing jobs bringing in automation instead of human workers.   edit: grammar Cheap credit is the norm and savings has been decimated. That's not exactly TRUE hardship but I can tell you it is on the horizon with the way the Fed behaves. If i cover my face with cheeto dust, can i get in? Right, I agree that the current ban will do that, but the user I was responding to is insinuating in his comment here, and elsewhere, that Obama was responsible for this when he suspended the VWP with the law that is cited.  That's not the case - a visa waiver only means you don't have to actually interview for a visa.  The suspension of that program did not prevent people from other means of traveling to the US from those countries. >One of its core drivers is to create an economic zone that is competitive with the US  *To create*? It already exists and is the biggest economic zone in the world.  But that's not how global economies work, and you can see that just from looking at the foreign investment strategies of literally every government. Or every sane one; you can stay out of this, North Korea. They invest heavily in one another and can expect good returns and stability for their effort. The only reason to want the EU to fail is because its politico-economics are holding you back, you expect you can't influence it to start moving in your desired direction, *and* you expect the splintered policies that follow to sum up to be more in alignment for you. I don't think any nation has all three.   But that could be the case for a corporation, easily in the short- and mid-term.  She has no choice now that Britain has killed most of it's best trade options because fuck immigrants.  >  little mouth-anus.  You mean cloaca?  I can't claim to be remotely close to the knowledge you clearly have on German politics.   However,  the gist of what you said is eerily similar to what I and many others said when considering the probability of Brexit and Trump.    I think you are right when you say that voting for the AfD doesn't make someone a racist necessarily .  But protest votes are still counted.     I predicted in new year, if trump wasn't the zenith then Le Pen would be in the French elections (assuming she wins) I mean Brexit has been a shit show, Trump's getting there, I mean how much do people need to take before saying ""yeah I ain't trusting you guys with changing the establishment""  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9GKL6i38pI  He says 'detention centers' at 1:15  Also he claims that Trump called him and asked him directly how to impose a 'Muslim ban' in a 'legal' way. I know, I wasn't talking about the ban though. I was just making a general statement but you are right. Personally I wouldn't move to the US, there is a very different lifestyle and mentality over there and it would be very difficult to adapt to them.   As an European, the thing that would mess with me the most would be the widespread gun culture. In Spain, there is no fear of getting shot by a criminal or the cops meanwhile in the US is a real problem that affects a lot of people. I think when people say Unamerican, they're talking about the America they are taught about in history class, The mythical America we like to pretend existed. Where all of the bad things we did are downplayed or rationalized away. First of all I've done plenty of manual labor throughout my life, and I'd prefer never having to as a job if I can avoid it. Second, yeah I know how dangerous and dehumanizing they are....that's exactly why I didn't vote for the man who promised to bring it all back here again. And hey, don't forget that those red sates stands for Republican, meaning they apparently believe in pulling yourself up by your bootstraps and either sinking or swimming when the going gets tough, and yet these people are failing hard at that and now wants things back how they used to be. They're really not just less fortunate than me either, we here on the coasts aren't all swimming in pools of money either, we just adapt, are decently educated (can't even say well educated really) and didn't vote against our own best interests.  >In my town of 60k nobody gives a shit, everyone goes on with their day to day duties.  > wasting 3+ hours protesting in LA  Well, you are definitely not proving yourself wrong. They see him as the lesser evil, compared to hillary. However they may change their thoughts now. Erogan (i spelled that wrong) wanted him toremove the name trump from a tower in instanbul because of his comments on muslims What is Alberta like? I have none of those options. I wish I didn't have to see my family go through what's about to come.  What's odd about these nationalistic ultimatums is that they never apply to natives. If you're so terribly concerned that a certain value be held by someone, wouldn't you want *everyone* in the country to hold it? What if don't have decent values and will fight for sharia land and against gay right but I just lie to you about it? Is that good enough? Homosexuals = women? That's a terrible thing to say! Vancouver Toronto Ottawa Montreal all have growing tech sectors. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/01/28/silicon-valley-publicly-denounces-trumps-ban-on-muslim-refugees/?utm_term=.626987fed9ce  http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/28/silicon-valley-slams-trump-immigration-ban.html You're welcome. Where is that? I've been living abroad since 2012 but my wife and i are gonna visit. Se's never been to a tim hortons (she's icelandic). We were also thinking about hitting a sonic in howell if its still there. Sounds like it's harder to move to Canada than it is the US... Interesting. From those rules, when my grandparents immigrated north from rural Mexico they would have been denied residency in Canada.  Trump has talked recently about doing away with NAFTA. What recourse would a person have then?  I mean he's already ignored a court order, which is explicitly not within the bounds of presidential authority.  slow is smooth and smooth is fast. Steve Bannon, Jeff Sessions and Stephen Miller no doubt had a hand in it. The wording that established the term limit could be construed as only applying against being elected as president, not necessarily as against succession.   It took 12 amendments to do that? What do you mean by global economies do not work like that? With relation to investment? Foreign direct investment does not always correlate with manufacturing trade. Countries make money from each other by making and then selling goods with each other. It doesn't have to always be 'investing' in them.  The eu as a trading block has a lot of power and can create barriers to entry and create subsidies to farmers (CAP). Creating a powerful trading block was one of the main EU ambitions. The chancellor of Germany isn't directly voted by the people. To be chancellor you need the support of over 50% of the MPs in the parliament. The AfD never had over 15% in polls and are losing voters again right now. Even the party of Angela Merkel didn't reach the 50% limit. So the government usually has to form a coalition with other parties. So far it is common practice that the largest coalition party also provides the chancellor. This means that realistically only the two strongest parties, the CDU (Merkel's party) or the SPD, will provide the chancellor. You can also see this in our language. The CDU and SPD nominated their candidates as ""Kanzlerkandidat"" (chancellor candidate) whereas the smaller parties nominated their ""Spitzenkandidat"" (top candidate).   In the next parilament we will probably have the following parties: CDU, SPD, Grne (green politics), Linke (left-wing populist), FDP (liberalism) and AfD (right-wing nationalist). The CDU and SPD have several different coalition options that don't need the AfD. Nearly every possible combination has been tested at least one time in one of the state governments (Germany is like the USA a federation), except CDU-Linke, which will never happen because they are politically to far away. Every party said they wont form a coalition with the AfD after the election.  This system makes it nearly impossible that the AfD will provide the chancellor, because they would need to overtake every other party and have over 50% alone. Even in the worst outcome of the election we would have at least a grand CDU-SPD-Grne-FDP coaltion rather than a AfD participation in the government.   I can assure you the next German chancellor will be Angela Merkel or Martin Schulz and no one else. Because German politics is comparatively boring and that is good. I've been defending this executive order from unreasonable people all day but this is a big smoking gun. The intent is clear now. That's probably it.  I try not to be so cynical about it but the truth is we've done a lot of fucked up shit.  Almost every country has. But, we should try to get closer to this ideal. It is never ending fight, but we must strive to be a city on a hill. The Democrats have been more pro-minority than pro-poor lately. Anyone with a shred of wordliness can see it coming that Trump won't do anything for the white lower class, but at least he promised them something during his campaign. Hillary supporters then start calling them all the bad things for supporting Trump, and it's no surprise that conversation with them becomes impossible.  Nah, they can use him as a useful idiot.. If he continues his path then they can rail about the US and turn on him.  Right now he's useful but even if he causes problems he's still useful.  It's win/win for them. Depends where. It's heavily forested outside of the major cities, though recently you may have heard of the tragic forest fires that devasted a large area a few months ago. North is where the oil sands/pipeline and oil companies reside. Resorts are all over the province as well. It's a very diverse land mass,Google maps/articles will give more info then I can fit in a comment. me either... I'm stuck with this looming disaster. Yes! I mean it like that too. Homosexuals = women = men = all of the other 87 genders people can be now! Also Waterloo. Cross Toronto off the list, and add Waterloo (that is the true Startup center).  Also lots of tech innovation in Calgary for the Oil and Gas industry, Oil and Gas want automation in a BIG way. This impacts small, small minority of their employees and will have negligent impact in their day to day operation ( if Trump banned Indian citizens from entering US, I can see your point). It is absurd to think that tech companies would just leave Silicon Valley because of it. I'm not a fan of this ban, but let's be realistic about its impact. So many things to thank Canada for, really.  Vermont only makes so much maple syrup. I'm from Middlesex county but I believe so. My parents live in Middletown. The Tim Hortons is in Middletown and there's a Sonic there as well. It's true, and it also takes a long time. The wait time right now if you're eligible and aren't sponsored by a spouse is around 18-24 months.   Source: went through this process with my mother and her new husband from South Africa. Took about 21 months.    Of course it is harder to get into Canada, there is a greater social safety net. Why would it be easier to get into a country with healthcare than it would be to get into America, where you have to only rely on your own wealth Yeah a lot of people seem to think that getting into Canada is easy but in most cases it may actually be harder since we have a pretty strict policy. I would say it is much harder to get into Canada than America but i can't confirm. I do know there are tons of reasons that will immediately disqualify you from entering Canada. So anyone who wishes to move here should definitely check out the criterias for eligibility  I would never advise anyone to overstay their visa or otherwise remain in Canada illegally, but such things are rumoured to have occurred. Yea it's easy. Just get a vacation visa and don't leave.  The other options I mentioned. He is currently talking about ""renegotiating"" NAFTA. I would hope the labour mobility provisions would remain. They are pretty important for tech and finance companies on both sides of the border. He can't just do that by himself, any modifications/removal of the NAFTA treaty must be agreed upon by all members.  how has ignored it ? isn't it the actual customs agents that are ignoring it Trump: ""I vas only following orderz""  Could be, but it has been interpreted as both. Keep in mind the first 10 were passed pretty much the at the same time as the constitution itself.  The 12 ammendment is what established the electoral college.  You know, that thing people were complaining about true winning despite loosing  the popular vote.  We didn't establish term limits until the 22nd ammendment.  Until FDR, presidents either stopped running or were beaten at the polls after a reasonable number of terms. What possible reason was their to defend it before? It's always been exactly who this is meant to target, as much as Trump/Trumpers wants to pretend otherwise. I think we first need to sit down and talk about what kind of city we as a society would like on that hill, because right now we seem to make a lot of assumptions about what kind of city the other side wants, and do very little listening to what the other side has to say. Yeah. Foreign Policy talked about how all around the world, there's been a shift. In the past you could determine if someone voted Republcian or Democrat based on their family income. It was the biggest predictor. Unfortunately, the left has abandone the poor and focused on minorities, which has hurt them in general because it is a minority vs the right, cultural majority. Anything decreasing US legitimacy is benefitial right now for Turkey, as it would increase their operation space in Iraq and Syria.    However, this doesn't change the fact that they will consider him an Islamophobe anyways.  so like, a useful idiot. As you said. No, no, the way it was phrased made it sound kind of like you were saying homosexuals are all women. I don't know, maybe it's just a stupid glitch of my mind.  That doesn't mean that Toronto isn't a tech centre though, it is officially the third largest home to high tech companies in North America. It may not enjoy the same startup culture as Waterloo but there is plenty of money and resources for startups to grow.  [Week 1.](http://fortune.com/2017/01/30/donald-trump-muslim-ban-tech-companies/) It depends. Family sponsorship is longer.  Express Entry is about 6-8 months. Spousal sponsorship is now 12 months in or out of country as of a change in December. Care to share your experience? Seriously debating moving back, and seeing if I can sponsor my girlfriend (we live in the US, she's a US citizen, I'm dual). Wondering if it's feasible. What are you here for sir?   A lifetime vacation.  Are they soft on illegal immigration like US before Trump? Yeah lol it was poorly worded. Sorry. I'm not sure how it would work if you're currently living in the US - it might matter how long you've lived outside Canada.   They had a long road and would highly recommend working with an immigration lawyer if you can afford one, or at least get a consult! Navigating the system is not the easiest thing and it is very difficult to get a hold of an actual at Immigration Canada. I believe the process would have been made easier if he had applied and gone through the process from South Africa. Unfortunately they started it after he moved to Canada and was on 6 month visitor visas (they left twice a year). My mother says it was not overly *complicated* just a lot of paperwork and a lot of patience. South Africa is not the most organized place either so getting documents from them (health checks, military records) took longer than necessary as well. This hopefully wouldn't be as much of a problem coming from the US! For them it was worth it all though - he says that though he was sad to leave his family behind he is grateful to live here.  Note that it will also be a lot easier if you are married as Canada just changed the immigration process so that spousal sponsorship is a 12 month wait instead of ~20. Not sure that's an option for you at this point but just thought I'd throw it out there.   So at the end of the day it's doable, but a long wait. Whether it's worth it or not really depends on your goals (professionally, personally) I think.  Thanks for all of that, really appreciate it!

"46",45,"5quwf9","2017-01-29","Here's a bit of clarification:   It's important to note that Lebanon's judicial system is not based on precedents like for example the U.S' is. So a judging ruling in favour of LGBT can't affect future rulings. We still have a long way to go.   Technically, we don't have a law against homosexuality per se. We have one against ""unnatural sex acts"". Now what ""unnatural"" means is up to the interpretation of the judge in each case.   The Muslim [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_evolution_of_the_Ottoman_Empire#/media/File:Territorial_changes_of_the_Ottoman_Empire_1862.jpg) deciminalised homosexuality in 1858 as part of the [Tanzimat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzimat#Reforms). This meant until the collapse of the empire places like Iraq, Lebabon, parts of Saudi Arabia (including Makkah and Medina), Syria and so on all had homosexuality decriminalised only to be bullied and berated by the colonial powers accused of being weak, feminine and uncivilized. Spring break in Lebanon anyone? Lebanon is unfortunate in being deeply influenced by different groups of clerics, yet one thing Christian priests (maronites, armenian, orthdox), Sunni, and Shia sheikhs agree on is being very traditional and conservative. LGBT acceptance needs a lot of work in Lebanon and the middle east. Lebanon has a relatively large middle class so homosexuality is tolerated in Beirut but with the dominance of Amal and Hezbollah in the south of Lebanon and salafist in the north this tolerance is disappearing. Lebanese American here. I'm sure this will fuel some anti-Islam hate here without how backwards even the most ""western"" and progressive nation, Lebanon,  is just now doing this. My family is Christian and I will tell you most in my generation are not different than most Muslims I know, we all want this! Our parents and grandparents generation are still backwards and hold onto anti-gay beliefs--similar to what I think most ""older"" generations in some parts of America are still like..and everywhere in the world.  We are slow to move forward with the rest of the world, we've had set backs, but we are. It just takes time.. The one thing the Shi'a, Sunni, and Christian religious figures can agree on in Lebanon: Being dicks about how people choose to live their lives.  So anything that moves towards less dickery is probably a good thing. Lebanese here. As many comments from my compatriots pointed out, many (probably most)  social/economic issues that Lebanon has are issues that exist in all our communities. Christian or Muslim. Even in the most liberal places in Beirut, they are there. I am proud to say that we're moving forward when it comes to accepting LGBT persons for who they are, but there's a ways to go. While there are many frustrating things about Lebanon, there is also a strong yearning among everyone there to make things better, and strong appreciations for the things we do get right. I still find it rather incredible that the only country in Asia to recognise same sex marriage is Israel, and even they have an archaic marriage system in the first place.  It's going to take a long time for LGBT rights to advance in Asia.  As Rupaul says "" You are not your skin color. You are not your gender, your politics, your career, or your marital status. You are none of the superficial things that this world deems important. The real you is the energy force that created the entire universe!"" These are the words of one of the most inspirational and loving people on earth. [Workin it - by Rupaul ](https://www.amazon.com/Workin-RuPauls-Guide-Liberty-Pursuit/dp/006198583X)  I really hope Lebanon is able to realize what makes everything around the country implode and then go in the opposite direction. It would be nice to see improvement in the world for a change. Hezbollah would allow this? It's nice that Ohio is finally catching up to the rest of the world.  it seems ridiculous that it's 'illegal' in the first place The only real democracy in the middle east. One which doesn't beg sects from going out to vote because another sect might have it easy.  Let's add them to the travel ban. No gay terrorists!  Finally. Some good news. And isn't it about time we all started working towards helping Lebanon embrace their LGBQT community? I think it is! Let's give a big hug (figuratively) to our soon-to-be gay embracing brothers and sisters in Lebanon! I am sure they will find a way soften the religious hardliners of the area. We sure all need that too! Bravo, gays! Thought that said LeBron Good for them. Lebanon is a good example of a more progressive and more liberal muslim country. Countrys like lebanon should be an example to the rest of the MEA states  Meanwhile one of Trump's rumoured Supreme Court nominees wants to criminalize it. [This close](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CdK4UOnPgMA/UUXdyhB3EaI/AAAAAAAAAVY/0iH8cfX3FSI/s1600/getsmart.jpg) The one thing the Shi'a, Sunni, and Christian religious figures can agree on in Lebanon: Being dicks about how people choose to live their lives. So anything that moves towards less dickery is probably a good thing. permalinkembedsavereportgive goldreply Legal change is a first step, but true change can only come from cultural shifts, being legal but still chased on the streets and hit for being homosexual aint great.   Any Lebanese with info on how accepted culturally/socially it is in the first place? Lebanon is careening into the 20th century. In all seriousness though, it's a very good thing. As a gay man reading this. Welcome to the 21st century. Took you long enough. Meanwhile in Australia which Sydney having one of, if not the largest homosexual community in the world considers sodomy illegal. Good.  I thought this said ""LeBron"" what can't that man do for one city.  Islam is so backwards.  Thought that said ""LeBron"" at first... Thanks Trump! They should outlaw Hezbollah. Who take their orders from Tehran *not Beirut*. Meanwhile America is getting closer to criminalizing it  because two women in love shoudnt be a crime :-p. It's hard seeing ppl protesting Trump and calling him all kinds of names when there's still shit like this going on in the world.  Les bo non I read this as ""Lebron is getting closer to decriminalizing homosexuality."" A few more women's Marches and they just might do it Meanwhile in America. . . Remember folks, when you think things are bad in America, this piece of shit country still hasn't decriminalized homosexuality in 2017. [removed] Maybe Trump will see the error of his ways and decriminalize homosexuality. ""getting closer"" is not good enough for me. how can you people defend this kind of backwards culture This just in from 2037: STD rates in Lebanon are through the roof! And Lebanon is supposed to be a socially advanced ME country. Goes to show how backwards that entire region is. That IS  the funny part. All these Gay and lez people Sticking up voting  for  Mrs clintion  &   president  Obama Then see how Mrs C  &  president  O Wanted all Muslims in USA.  L. O. L Muslims want to beat the hell out Of all   Gays & lez,,  yes they Do    Do same. Homework ..... There are going to be a lot of sore bottoms in Lebanon when they make this official. Straight guys will be like 'might as well give 'er a go; this is history after all.' No it should be criminalized    Another country embraces western decadence. I hope they like freaks, 'cause they're going to have lots of them in a few years... >Now what ""unnatural"" means is up to the interpretation  Anal Is this because Lebanon used the Civil Law legal system as opposed to Common Law? And does this mean that for example in a common law country a judge rules murder legal (might be a stupid example) this will set a precedent for future rulings? In a world with [chimps fuckin frogs](https://youtu.be/n5sD3dyBUqo), [monkeys fucking deer](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/01/macaque-monkey-sika-deer-interspecies-mating/), [dolphins fucking blowholes](https://youtu.be/Q52tA8VO6Uw) and [tiny fish](https://youtu.be/rkA4Mij2RFo), can't we come together as one people and agree that the only thing unnatural is religious sex shaming? People getting upset about ""unnatural"" things never sits right with me. I mean it's unnatural to mow our lawns, shave our beards and use computers etc..  yet we do these things on a regular basis, why are these OK but other things aren't? What ironic bullying. Any evidence that they were bullied because of that decriminalisation? before oscar wilde was jailed Interesting. Sorry if this is super highfalutin, but it's probably a good idea to add, for anyone interested, that ""homosexuality"" and ""heterosexuality"" as a anthropological categories by which we can ontologically understand human behaviour are pretty modern inventions. Don't get me wrong: I'm sure there have been all sorts of ways to define or categorize people that prefer men over women or women over men, or somewhere in the middle, along with all sorts of positive and negative prejudices attached. But, the (quasi-scientific) ideas that being ""homosexual"" is an essential part of one's individual nature, or that heterosexuality is the default and homosexuality is inherently against nature, or that homosexual behaviour is *not* an essential part of one's nature but is a form of mental illness or is the result of a lack of civilization, or whatever, are distinctly modern and Western in origin and come out of the academy. It's a fallacy to think that if we go back in time in Europe, or to non-Western/presumably less ""modern"" parts of the world, that attitudes toward gay people are bound to be more hateful or oppressive. There is a huge spectrum of opinions over time and space. I don't know about the decriminalisation of Homosexuality in paticular, but I know that many liberal reforms of the Tanzimat weren't applied in Arabia and other Arabic regions of the Ottoman Empire.  Egypt, for example, maintained Mamluk laws and traditions, and the Hedjaz (the region of the two Holy Cities) had practically no Tanzimat reforms applied.  Bernard Lewis went in depth about it in ""What Went Wrong?"", which is about the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the rise of the European powers following the loss of the 2nd siege of Vienna. Oh, fair enough. In that case there is nothing wrong with them not decriminalising homosexuality.  The reason for the extreme laws there is because they are Arabs as opposed to the Ottoman empire which was Turkish. It has nothing to do with ""Colonial"" powers. its okay guys, according to Reddit if Nazi Germany decriminalized homosexuality then they would be a heaven to live in! the best, i'm telling you folks! also they barely had any control in Saudi Arabia, and you were ABSOLUTELY not allowed to do that in Mecca or Medina, would you do that then I can guarantee you that your body would have been chopped and fed to the dogs, people here are so cynical it's hilarious.  Seriously seeing people here claiming this shit is so misinforming and funny, I swear had an Arabic history teacher seen this then he would have gone insane.  > Lesbanon I've been trying to convince my gay Canadian friends to take a trip to Beirut. But no luck. Maybe one day  Definitely going Depends on Netanyahus plans.  >hezbollah in the south and salafists in the north  Fuck me. What a nightmare. So basically if you live where Muslims control Lebanon don't be gay and if you're around more Christians then being gay might be possible.  If any of them give you shit, ask them when the United States legalized homosexual activity.  [The answer is 2003.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_v._Texas)  Lebanon is behind us, sure. That's easy enough to say. But ain't nobody in the whole fucking world has a right to get all high and mighty towards this news. Can confirm, older generations in the states are pretty much total dicks too. The millenials are to blame for everything! Israel recognizes foreign same-sex marriages for some purposes, but you can't get same-sex married in Israel because marriage is controlled by religious courts, none of which allow same sex marriages.  It's not just Asia, very few countries in the world allow same sex marriage. Taiwan is very likely to make same sex marriage legal this year, which will make it the first asian country to do so. To put things into context, homosexual activity was illegal in over a dozen US states 14 years ago. That's fourteen years ago, not one hundred forty years ago. I visited Jordan and remember that homosexuality was not a crime there, although gay marriage is not a thing there (yet). Israel doesn't allow same-sex marriage to happen within it's own country.  It also doesn't allow people of different religions marry each other in their own country. India also allows Well they try to sterilize Ethiopians with poisoned vaccines so don't give em' too many brownie points. Isreal is  an Asian country?  Hezbollah is probably the least of their worries. Hezbollah and Helem (the LGBT rights group in Lebanon) have worked together in the past on issues of refugee support and HIV awareness and likely still do, albeit quietly. Not saying they're good guys, but homophobia is not high on their list of ideologies.  Source: http://www.hotpress.com/politics/Hezbollah-and-homophobia-the-truth/4203352.html Hezbollah doesn't get involved in these aspects of our lives. The thing holding us back are the older generation (from all religions even the non-religious parents) who still think homosexuality is contagious and that by somehow decriminalizing homosexuality their kids are gonna catch it. No, but they might not be in the majority :) Can you explain the joke It was illegal in over a dozen US states 14 years ago.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_v._Texas That's religion for ya. Don't joke :( i'm supposed to go to Lebanon this summer. Honestly this is the best comment here. All we need is for people to talk about how good this ruling is without being condescending or trying making this about Islam, Israel, goats, or Trump. Hopefully more lawmakers will want some of that praise too. Whatever gets us closer to LGBT rights. It's actually a bit tricky to say that Lebanon is just a ""Muslim country"". It has a majority Muslim population but a good 35/40 percent of Lebanese are christians and there is a strong Christian cultural influence.  the balls it takes to be supportive of gays in the middle east, that's nuts Lebanon is not a muslim country. The judge pushing this is a Christian. They're still shit. Plus what about those Hezbollah guys? This adds nothing to the discussion  I'm gonna assume it's the same as the rest of non-Gulf majority Islamic countries. Young urbans dgaf, old people and rurals are homophobic, but nobody cares enough to raise the pitchfork. Keep it on the hush hush, live and let live type of shit.  Hezbollah  recently came out and condemned the killing of gays.  It's more of a state-within-the-state situation. They don't control the country but they're autonomous.  ... what are you on about? You mean 21st ? The last state to repeal their sodomy laws was Tasmania in 1997. Lawrence vs Texas was only in 2003... Heh, me too. *What??* What does your comment have to do with this article? Completely different topics... it's a big advance in human and LGBT rights for a middle eastern country :) where did you get that from? Don't get so high and mighty. The United States only [legalized homosexual activity 14 years ago.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_v._Texas)  Yeah, they're behind a little bit. But they're gonna catch up soon. Seriously. My son was mad at me because I punched him, but he doesn't understand that some people get *murdered*. So tired of people bitching about punches and slaps while others are getting murdered /s Lawrence vs Texas was only in 2003... People are just jumping on the bandwagon when it comes to things like trump  Its cool to hate him [Homosexual activity was illegal in over a dozen states in the US until 14 years ago.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_v._Texas)  get off your high horse Sorry I want the US to strive to be better than Lebanon   Lawrence vs Texas was only in 2003... Its a country in the middle east are you expecting a civilised society   Most of the countries that have death penatly or jail for homosexuality are in the middle east or africa   The last 14 US states got their sodomy laws repealed in 2003, how are they doing on the fire situation? Lawrence vs Texas was only in 2003... Have you been to Mississippi? Stay in schools kids. Lawrence vs Texas was only in 2003... Why on earth would you suggest that? Are people's bedrooms worth policing? Western? I fail to see whats Western about it -- the Ottoman Empire decriminalized it a long long time ago. When was homosexuality legalized in the US?  [Like, 100 years ago or something, right?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_v._Texas) If animals have butt sex, that makes it natural. Unnatural would have to be like... idk.. having sex with man made materials... like a pocket pussy.. hey, I'm going to go umm.. hide some personal items.  [removed] So many Lebanese female ""virgins"" need to go to jail if that's the case.  To clarify: most Leb girls will take it in the ass to ""preserve their virginity"" for marriage. What about the poop hole loop hole?  Does that work in court of law? > I ANAL  FTFY I'm not educated enough on Civil Law and Common law systems to give you a good answer. I'll say that its judicial system was heavily influenced by France's since we used to be a French colony, so you might be able to draw parallels from there. All common law countries have murder listed in the criminal legislation very unambiguously, so a judge can't rule it legal and can't interpret the law as saying it is legal.  I know what you are getting at though, and it does happen that a judge may rule one way and then another judge rules another way, normally the way favoured by more judges or judges from higher courts is treated as superior. I understand your sentiment, but the examples you gave aren't exactly the norm in the animal kingdom. A more valid example would be homosexuality in the animal kingdom, which seems to be more prevalent and documented. Even then you'll get the argument from men of religion that we are above animals and should not act in the same way... Comparing us to animals isn't really a good way to put it. Some animals kill their own in the wild. Does that equate it to being natural for us? No kidding. The Ottoman Empire committed genocide, so somehow I don't think it was bullied by someone calling it names. Yes, while it was decriminalised in the Ottoman empire, it was the opposite scenario in Europe, especially in England (a well publicized case is Oscar Wild's for example). Once they got their hands on the territory which was once under Ottoman rule, they tried to instill the same values in society as the pretext of ruling these lands was to ""civilize"" them. Honestly, the more dirty anal sex, the better. > Egypt, for example, maintained Mamluk laws and traditions, and the Hedjaz (the region of the two Holy Cities) had practically no Tanzimat reforms applied.   This is bull for two reasons:  1. There is no such thing as ""Mamluk laws and traditions"", the Mamluks had a Shariah law system.   1. Egypt wasn't even under the control of the Ottoman Empire during the Tanzimat era, and the Mamluks were massacred by Muhammad Ali Pasha decades earlier. Egypt at the time was using the Napoleonic law code.   If you want to go to a gay-friendly city in the Middle East, Tel Aviv is pretty much your best (read:only) bet. One of the great LGBT cities of the world. Too soon!  He can plan whatever he wants, he cant do shit. Its not the 90s anymore. They learned in 2006.  You mean Olmert's? He's in jail now. Why would Netanyahu want to do anything in Lebanon? It is Lebanon that doesn't want peace with Israel. If the Lebanese come now to Israel and say we want to make a peace deal, Israel will sign it on the spot. Sounds bad but on the coast in Beirut and Batroun it is heavily Christian and Westernized and liberal. The beach parties on the Mediterranean are unlike anything in the world. I've been to Venice beach and fort Lauderdale and the parties in Lebanon on the coast absolutely destroy them. So many Christian Lebanese Americans that the US dollar is a de facto currency there  Having lived there, i can confirm that religous groups make the place a hostile cluster-fuck a lot of the time... But the landscape , women and nightlife are fucking beautiful! Christians just like Muslims believe homosexuality is a sin. Christians today unlike many backwards Muslims seem to ignore the unfortunate parts of their text, hopefully most Muslims will ignore the horrible parts of their text. And if you believe there isn't homophobia among conservative Lebanese Christians than you are a naive person. And In Beirut there are tons of LGBT people just like in Cairo just like in Tunis or any city in the middle east that has an educated middle class, even though the governments are still way too backwards on the issue.  The fact that it required a court case rather than the politicians have the guts to pass a law speaks as to how socially backwards America actually is. This is not the US, this is just Texas. Some parts of the US had decriminalised homosexuality in the '60s. Israel doesnt have same sex marriage, but as far as I know it has official partnership with most (all?) advantages of marriage even though its called differently. > Israel recognizes foreign same-sex marriages for some purposes, but you can't get same-sex married in Israel because marriage is controlled by religious courts, none of which allow same sex marriages.   Incidentally, this is how Lebanon recognizes civil marriages between people of 2 different faiths- its constitution doesn't currently have a mechanism for civil marriage, but recognizes those carried out elsewhere.  There's now an entire cottage industry of travel agents selling combined marriage/honeymoon trips to Cyprus for those who couldn't normally get married under Lebanese law. However, Israel's culture is quite open regarding sexual orentation and a lot of stuff.  They're, however, quite racist against muslims.  Source: Israeli friend. Most of Europe, North and South America, and Oceania does. All of Asia and almost all of Africa doesn't. Trump's signing so much stuff it's hard to keep up but the way America helps Israel fend off the wolves surrounding it, so it should with Taiwan. > It also doesn't allow people of different religions marry each other in their own country.  False. The religions themselves control marriage and can decide to allow interfaith marriages. Islam allows Muslim men to marry non-Muslims, and as such an Israeli Jewish woman can marry a Muslim man in Israel. The archaic marriage system is inherited from the British mandate. > It also doesn't allow people of different religions marry each other in their own country.  What, seriously? Now that's weird. I know this sounds weird of me, and I really have nothing against gay marriages, but... yeah what does anyone expect? Israel is considered one of the holiest places on the planet according to monotheistic religions, its no surprise same sex marriages aren't legal there. On that note, anyone whos been to Tel Aviv will notice that theres a pretty substantial amount of support for the lgbt community, such as gay clubs.  Hence the   >archaic   Everything I've said still stands  Germany - Severe Discrimination.  Canada - Systemic Discrimination.  Ukraine - Mostly Satisfactory.  Kosovo - Free and Equal.  Got it. The Middle East is in Asia.  The entire middle east, India and most of Russia are a part of the continent of Asia. We could go anti pc old school and what most people think of as Asia would be the The Orient and them Orientals.  This may be a dumb question but how can there be an LGBT rights group in a country where it's illegal? Wouldn't they be arrested or shut down? Or does every single person in it claim to be straight? There's a town in Ohio called Lebanon yeah, I understand that, it's ridiculous that it is/was People weren't executed for it though Lebanon is the only Arab country with Tunisia whose constitution and laws don't mention religion at all.   Also you'll find that Beirut is a lot more gay-friendly than many places in Europe or the US.  Doesn't need religion for that.  One should not forget that communist countries outlawed homosexuality as well add even in the secular West attitudes towards gay started to shift 20  years ago  Lebanon's one of the most secular countries in that region, thanks for trying to inject your pet political topic into this One thing about Lebanon is they have a large diaspora (in North America, Australia and Latin America). 6,000,000 people in Lebanon, 8-14 million Lebanese overseas.  Lebanon itself is 40% Christian, 60% Muslim, but the diaspora, especially in Latin America, is more Christian.  So if you account for Lebanese overseas, there may be more Lebanese Christians than Muslims, but still, it's about 50/50.  Lebanese Muslims themselves are fairly divided among Sunnis and Shi'ites, and of course, the Jews fled for Israel after the Arab-Israeli conflicts.  [Here is the territorial divide in the country](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Lebanon_religious_groups_distribution.jpg/793px-Lebanon_religious_groups_distribution.jpg). And 80% of Lebanese worldwide are Christian, who outnumbered the population in Lebanon by a factor of 4. Lebanese are primarily Christians not Muslims.  > they're still shit   Because you're really fucking qualified to say that a whole country with 4.5 million people is ""still shit"", right?  Yes it does, you just don't want to talk about it The conversation involves people other than you, so that's not your claim to make ;) Do you have a source? Not saying you're wrong but this is hard to believe. Regardless I would be like it to be true :) Nah, I meant the 1900s (or at least late 1900s) - homosexuality was mostly effectively decriminalized in most of the west (while maintaining a severe opprobrium).  that's a little better than the 2003 ruling in the United States.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_v._Texas Hezbollah is part of the Lebanese government. They take their orders from Tehran - *where being gay can get you executed.*  I don't think Hezbollah (part of the government) will allow the decriminalization of homosexuality in Lebanon. Call me crazy. Conjecture I imagine.  Well with things like FADA in the works we are at the very least going backwords in terms of the governments recognition of the civil rights of LGBTQ people.      EDIT: but were of course no where near criminalizing homosexuality, i assume hes exagerating Its not farfetched to think that it could be on Trump's to do list given the Muslim ban, and the wall. Plus the VP is super anti-homosexual. And they are miles ahead.  Homosexual activity was illegal in over a dozen states in the US until 14 years ago.  The USA hasn't got a scratch on many European nations when it comes to LGBT rights, so get off your high horse. considering those last 14 states are the ones that still allow beastiality, who knows Insecurity issues, obviously. Morality and public decency are definitely worth policing. I was joking can you upvote Wow, nice link.  Can we stop the ""oh but we weren't a lot better a century ago!""-thing please?   That should really not have anything to do here except show how backwards these countries still are. but loads of animals have gay sex as well XD  But those animals have mental illnesses. So they're no better than animals? I see no flaws in that line of thought. Lebanon isn't Afghanistan.  Or underage boys. > Butt stuff that doesn't involve goats.  ... is butt stuff that I have no interest in. That would do it, yes. US law is based off of British legal systems instead, which is much more deferential to precedent. There are beetles that deliberately have sex with other larger male beetles to tire them out so that they can sneak in and impregnate the larger beetle's harem.  It's a stupid argument, because animals also routinely practice cannibalism, incest, rape and murder. If you're going to argue for homosexuality, don't use this argument. I don't see how you can call something occurring in nature unnatural, but you make a strong point.  People having sex with leprechauns or vampires?  Sure I'll give you that's unnatural.   Anything naturally occurring should get a pass . yeah, that's why murder isn't illegal for being ""unnatural"" but for being destructive towards having a functioning society. Yes it does.   What is natural and what is good are unrelated. As natural as breathing.  Look around you.  After it became a constitutional monarchy under the control of a secularist reformist party called the young turks. The genocide was not decreed by the caliph. Also the British Empire commited genocide in India and nobody talks about that. The tanzimat was not accepted as readily by the rest of the ottoman empire though?  [Napoleon loved men](http://gayinfluence.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/napoleon-bonaparte.html?m=1) What did they learn? The dollarization isn't due to Christian presence, it's due to a massive inflation that happened during the Civil War. Historically Beirut wasn't exclusively Christian, and isn't. It was always a mix of Eastern Orthodox and Sunnis. More recently it has people from all over the religious spectrum because of the business opportunities it offers. It's true that Lebanon's liberalism can be somewhat attributed to the high Christian ratio, but let's not forget that the Christians in the country side are as conservative as their Muslim counterparts, and the Church still plays a role in censorship of materials it might deem obscene. Liberalism in the coastal regions, specifically Beirut arose due to the mix of religions as well as the high socioeconomic factors from the trade it brought. Damn. I'm sold. Might go for a bit of a detour next time I take a trip to Greece. The coast is mostly Muslim My parents are conservative Lebanese Maronites.  They are indeed homophobic but like the actual definition of the word, they are scared of gay people. They don't believe in the death penalty for gays like Muslims do though.  What's wrong with Christians having a distaste for homosexuality? The law is and has always been the only problem. You don't need to force changes in social attitude.  Moral laws = bad.  Moral beliefs which admonish certain lifestyle choices = who gives a fuck--free marketplace of ideas. The difference is generally in the middle east, Muslims will throw you off a roof, the others won't. This obviously isn't true in most cases, but Judaism and Christianity in the region are definitely more liberal. Hurr de hurr! I'm a self-loathing American who makes idiotic comments insulting and generalizing Americans on Reddit! Give me upvotes!! Lawrence vs. Texas legalized homosexuality in 14 states, plus non-state territories, not just Texas. Same thing in Israel - Cyprus is the go-to place. Funny how much tourism you can get from religious laws in other countries. Anywhere outside Tel-Aviv you'll find much of Israel is actually still pretty Homophobic, mostly in the Orthodox community. There was actually 6 people stabbed at an Israeli pride-parade a couple years back. Also /u/incendiaryblizzard is right Gay-Marriage is still not officially legal in Israel as well :/ >Racist against muslims  If you can convert to it, it's not a race. Also I'm not sure if you're aware, but Muslims aren't exactly best friends with Jews. According to Wikipedia, only one Oceanian country (New Zealand) and roughly 2/5 of European countries allow same sex marriage. Overall, only 22 countries out of about 200 in the world. > The religions themselves control marriage and can decide to allow interfaith marriages. Islam allows Muslim men to marry non-Muslims, and as such an Israeli Jewish woman can marry a Muslim man in Israel. The archaic marriage system is inherited from the British mandate.  Wow, masterful defense - blame religions and the british instead of your country for a shitty theocratic system which doesn't provide a secular common law for two consenting adults to get married.  It says that the different religions decide who can marry - which provides undue powers to whatever arbitrary bodies lay claim to be the arbiters of Islam, Judaism and Christianity. (As you can see in this thread, there are Israeli govt. supporters in this thread conveniently bashing the religious fundamentalists instead of recognizing that the government has intentionally empowered them.)  It's convenient since both major religions shun inter-marriage (Islam only allows men to marry women 'of the book' and convert them, Judaism has some restrictions as well), so it succeeds in effectively splitting the country into two immiscible groups, which seems to be one of the intentions of the policy.   Other countries with religion based civil law - e.g. India, also have a secular option available for people of any religion or no religion to get married. The lack of a secular option means that Israelis of different religions have to travel to a different country to get married.  Actually, they **are** legal there You just have to get one done outside the country because of the old Ottoman laws regarding religious autonomy.   Its weird, but if you are gay and get married anywhere else, you are legally married in Israel. If you're trying to say that Ukraine is more open to homosexuality than Canada then I can tell you that their source is fucked up or that is wrong. 100%.  Edit: Took a closer look at the criteria used and focused on for the report. It seems to look mainly at ""secularism"" and atheism as focal points for its measures. Besides Egypt. All the ME except most of Egypt, which is in Africa.  But carring me orientar- offensive to me Civil and human rights organizations are allowed to operate freely. We  have the right to protest freely, free speech to some degree (curtailed by libel/religious libel laws) so it's not all bad. We have democracy, albeit very very flawed. From a legal point of view, there's no such thing as ""being gay"" and as such you cannot be arrested for being gay as long as you don't do anything gay in public (kissing, flirting, etc...). The law is against ""unnatural sexual acts"" and not against being gay. Luckily, championing gay rights is not considered a gay thing to do, so people can do that. They do get harrassed fairly often though. And people at protests often wear masks to hide their identities. Being LGBT in India is technically illegal (wording of the law says 'no unnatural sex', can be interpreted as whatever), but it is rarely/never enforced. LGBT rights groups are loud. There are gay pride parades.  Ohh. Lmao I didn't even know that and I'm from Cleveland of course.  i just don't want people to lose perspective and start using this as an excuse to bash middle easterners or any bullshit like that. Except for Matthew Shepherd... Yeah, I'm pretty sure no country legalized gay marriage on the 20th century. All were in 2000 and on  Hell, mine (Spain) was the third in the world to do that, and that was only 12 years ago! You're only proving their point, that the one going to decriminalise it is the most secular.  > 6,000,000 people in Lebanon, 8-14 million Lebanese overseas. Lebanon itself is 40% Christian, 60% Muslim, but the diaspora, especially in Latin America, is more Christian.  Being a member of the Lebanese diaspora doesn't mean you're a Lebanese citizen.  Lebanese diaspora != Lebanese citizens.  Yes I am. Ask the average Muslim what they think of homosexuality, you'll see im correct. Islam is a disease. All organized religion is, but some are worse than others.  There could be a house fire in Spain and you'd find a way for it to be Donald Trump's fault  It's an opinion ;) Hezbollah's weird: they're as much a nationalist organization a religious one.  Lebanon is not only Hezbollah, and they don't get to decide on everything. And the main issue in Lebanon is not Hezbollah, it's the religion and the religious leaders from both sides, christians and muslims, who don't find any interest in Lebanon becoming secular, because they would lose their political power. So instead of focusing on Hezbollah, I'd say the big issue here is the religion, and the power it has on the country's politics.  They seem to have no problems with bars and bikinis everywhere. Hezbollah has few seats in the government. It's not up to them.  Well my bedroom certainly isn't public - I'll be as indecent as I want, thanks. I never downvoted you in the first place. If it starts a discussion I won't downvote posts that I disagree with, since I was generally curious to hearing someones answer.  Since jokes don't contribute to discussions I feel no urge upvote either. >Can we stop the ""oh but we weren't a lot better a century ago!""-thing please?  ...Did you read his link? The entire point is homosexuality was only fully legalized in the UK and US in 2000 and 2003 respectively. You need to take a long hard look at the current state of the US before calling other countries backwards.  Lebanon is a travel area for lgbt community anyway. heheh, butt loads Like swans for example Doesn't make it natural. I can't support criminalizing homosexuality but it's a stretch to somehow suggest it's natural. Jim, get the car battery The term is natural, meaning of nature.. Unless the word has a different meaning in their language. or New Zealand  I served on the Israel-Lebanon border, and i have to say... Yeah, sheep are more common around here than goats. From both sides of the fence >_< Only if it has to be good /s Whats to stop judges making totally stupid ruling that will affect future decisions? Do they get fired? It seems like judges in common law countries have an incredible amount of power (the ability to set precedents) compared to civil law judges who have a ""rule book"" so to speak? You should tell TRP this sage advice. I mean Black widows kill their mates, killing is common among apes and dolphins have been known to rape people. The argument of weather it is natural or not is stupid. What we should be arguing about is weather or not it is a detriment to society. Thats not unnatural  Thats Supernatural... now on season 12 The exception in nature IS unnatural  Don't both with these people. Natural and unnatural are thrown around like good and bad to try and tell you what you should do. By their own logic, engineering is unnatural, which is a real boner killer Except in every fucking thread about Winston Churchill. I'm not very knowledgeable on that part of history, so I'll refer you to u/Kan3ani's comment that mentions tanzimat [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5quwf9/lebanon_is_getting_closer_to_decriminalising/dd2o3id/). I remember a post on r/AskHistorians mentioning that homosexuality among the Ottoman elite and high class was a norm, though I don't know if I can find it anymore. That they can destroy our country and infrastructure (in a few hours) but if we keep up the nightlife during the war then we'll say we won. We won.  They can't fuck with Lebanon as easily as they used to. Might do now as Hezbollah is busy winning the war for Assad in Syria. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to visit the Lebanon sub. If you do decide to go, take /u/HowlingWalrus 's advice and reach out to some locals about it. They will help you to figure out what sites to see, what places to visit and how to get there.

Quit your bullshit mate.  I am a Muslim, and I *definitely* do not believe in the death penalty for gays. Nor do any of the Muslims I know who are from entirely different countries. My parents are Lebanese Maronites too. My mom doesn't care if someone is gay, supports their rights. My asshole Dad flat out insults gay people. One day my brother asked him ""what would you do if dewhashish was gay?"" My dad responds ""I'd kill him."" in a full serious tone. This is personal experience. Other Christians might be even more conservative than your parents though. why are they afraid of gay people ?? Same. Do you're parents like Trump? Mine do. There is barely a difference between religious groups in Lebanon when it comes to this, it's more of a generational thing. My Muslim parents would be horrified if one of their kids is gay, but they'd have our backs.  Because if a homosexual kid grows up in a homophobic christian family their life could be hell because of it I'm an open atheist and bisexual and most of my family is Muslim from Egypt and Lebanon, I have tons of gay and bisexual friends in Egypt and Lebanon and they haven't been thrown off of roofs. People need to hide their natural sexual identity because of religious fanaticism *that has spread in part with the blessing of western governments* also, I want too end Islam and all religions one day, but an educated Muslim family is not the same as a brainwashed salafist .   Also, the only ideology that openly kills gays are ISIS and its ideological forefather the salafists of Saudi Arabia whose government is friends with most western nations, and who is allowed to spread their toxic fanaticism throughout the world.   1) I'm not an American - numerous times I have mentioned in previous posts that I'm from New Zealand.  2) Congress and senate represent the will of the American people - the lack of legislation to decriminalise anal sex is a fair representation of the fact that the majority of Americans are backwards by virtue of the types of people they vote in to power in the first place. The American government represents the will of the American people - you live in a system where you get to choose who represents you - how about taking responsibility for the decisions you make instead of being smug. Okay, fair enough, but that still leaves 36 states (plus the District of Columbia?). My friend is from Holon, Tel-Aviv, so he might not know a lot outside of Tel-Aviv. You should be right. And the head of the Orthodox community visited the victims in the hospital to apologize (although he wasn't even remotely responsible)  That gay pride stabbing wasn't a homophobic attack if i recall correctly. The guy was just nuts.  I agree with the first part. But what do you mean Muslims aren't the best friends with Jews? That's a huge generalization seeing that I know Muslims and Jews who are friends with each other. Also, if you're talking about throughout history it definitely goes both ways.  Think in term of population.  Although I had already put Australia in. Only a metter of one or two years, though. I'm not defending it. I have been criticising it for years. It's just important to not exaggerate. Israel is a secular country founded by atheists, yet many people seem to think it's a Jewish theocracy where non-Jews aren't allowed to vote or anything. Israel even bans Jews from praying at their holiest site so as not to anger Muslims. Marriage is one of the few areas where they are less secular than other western countries, along with the discrimination against non-orthodox converts who want to make aliyah.  The map doesn't do homosexuality exclusively. I'm still not quite happy with the results it gives, but it has a global pov on themes. Egypt is both in Asia and Africa I think (the Sinai)? just like turkey is both in Europe and Asia. Now maybe somebody can explain why Papua New Guinea is split between two continents. dude homosexuality has been bashed in all four corners of the earth, marriage equality still does not exist in first world countries like japan, south Korea, or Singapore (all majority atheist countries). I'm far from an Islamophobe or religion hater. I agree with what you're saying, angry assholes will hang onto this to fit their hate narratives No I'm not, religion may be a part of it along with a host of other stuff. User above's probably a neckbeard who thinks 'religion poisons everything' or some other nonsense and wants to ride my comment to bash religion in general. You can't do that over here neckbeards. I agree with you, but Lebanese citizenship works off of bloodlines (father has to be a Lebanese citizen to pass on citizenship). A lot of Lebanese internationals are emigrants (were born in Lebanon with citizenship) and many of their children that were born outside of Lebanon are registered citizens.  IIRC there is no distinction in citizens that were born abroad or on Lebanese soil.  For the most part it does. My Dad was born in Lebanon, and because of that I am a Lebanese citizen, and so are my children.  I can now safely assume that you don't know anything about Lebanon. Thanks for clarifying that.  Oh okay, we're doing house fire examples?  So imagine there's a house fire being put out, and someone points out someone else wants to start one, then you say ""This has nothing to do with housefires"" Or as you people like to call it, ""alternative facts"".

[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_Offences_Act_1967) Currently the most liberal society out there together with other western nations.   I'd love to see you claim which non-western countries are less backward. Then what is your definition of natural? It does happen in nature.. Animals do it, Humans do it - both are part of 'Nature' even though the latter sometimes like to pretend they are not. So something that happens in nature without any human involvement is not natural?  Not following your reasoning. or Wales That's why there's appeals. Some low court judge applies a bad precedent and it can be overturned on appeal. The low court decision then has no precedential value.  And they get downvoted to oblivion or someone brings up how ""good"" he was for the western world and thus should be excused for committing genocide. > They can't fuck with Lebanon as easily as they used to  Are you equating Lebanon with the terrorist organization Hezbollah now? Also, the Lebanese army didn't even fight the IDF because they knew it would be suicidal. And the IAF was flying pretty freely in the skies of Lebanon. It was Hezbollah who was fucking with Israel, not the other way around . Israel left Lebanon and wants nothing to do with it. It was a Hezbollah attack on Israel that sparked the 2006 war, a small insignificant detail that everyone seem to conveniently forget. But coast as in next to the beach is mostly muslim, maronites are more in the inside (which makes sense) Maronites originally came from the mountains and then settled on the coast.  I'm not really worried about the majority -- I am worried about the bigoted minority, and those are some pretty big minorities. Most of those add up to almost half, and that's really, really fucking bad. That's hundreds of millions of people in total that think homosexuals should be punished for being homosexuals. How is that not a huge problem?  this is /r/worldnews. not the best subreddit to browse through if you're muslim. Do you think it should be allowed? Then you're nominally religious. By definition a Muslim follows quranic instructions, [including this one](http://legacy.quran.com/4/16). The Quran pretty clearly prescribes the death penalty for homsexuality  I suggest you accustom yourself to the rulings from the four madhabs on sex between members of the same sex; regardless of the number of 'witnesses' required the whole idea of criminalising it in the first place is fucking stupid and the fact that you duck, dodge and dive the obvious evidence in front of you tells me that being a Muslim for you is more about being part of a social club than a clear belief in the divine word of god and the sharia being the divine law from god to humanity. Hahaha. Ditto with my dad  They come from a homophobic culture. Even the Lebanese Christian villages have staunch social conservative values. They're a product of where they're from  Lifelong Republicans. They love trump. They LOVE Bush for kicking Syria out of Lebanon  The way I said it might've been kind of vague. What I meant by ""what's wrong with Christians having a distaste for homosexuality?"" is ""what about this state of affairs compels governmental interference?""  As in, it sucks, but that's the culture you live in, try to change it if you find it wanting. Do you disagree with the notion that proscritptions of Allah as seen in the Quran do in fact justify death penalties for homosexual activities?  Fellow atheist asking here.  I've met quite a few Shia Muslims and they're always... Not nuts. But what I've read of the Quran has always led me to the conclusion that the ""non-crazy"" Muslims are always the ones who haven't critically examined the proscriptions of the Quran and Hadiths, and that those who do either become Atheists or Salafists: that the word of Allah is in fact telling Muslims to act as Al Nusra does. You can either go ""well that's insane so fuck this whole religion"" or you can become a Salafist. I'm happy to see you made the former choice but I'd like you to argue with me so that I can either adjust my opinion or be more sure of the correctness of my conclusions.  My impression has always been that the greater a Muslim nation's culture is, the less nutty they are, because they can temper the absolute wretched evil insanity of Islam with a beautiful culture, history, set of beliefs and traditions. Iran being more moderate because of the greatness of Persian culture, Iraqi history being great, again because of the greatness of Persian culture and its ability to influence the greatest of the Iraqi empires, Egypt being a little less nutty because of the greatness of Egyptian culture, Lebanon being less nutty because Marionites are in control, Kurdish regions being less nutty because they're Kurds first and Muslims second, Turks being Turks first and Muslims second, Syria being less nutty because Alawites (which from my understanding are hardly Muslim at all) are in power and so on and so forth. Hamas, the PA, most of Arabia, ISIS, Pakistan, and parts of Lebanon are all dangerous for gays.  I am not saying all muslims, or even most muslims are the issue. Some Muslims, and more Muslims than Christians in the middle east, are violent against gays. It is why they often flee their home countries.  I wasn't trying to hate on Lebanon, and I know that there are plenty of good people there. I probably deserve the downvote due to the ambiguity of my post. > religious fanaticism that has spread in part with the blessing of western governments  Give it a rest, Cenk. Hurr de hurr! I'm a smug asshole who likes to post low-quality, anti-American circlejerk shitposts on Reddit to get internet points!  Those sodomy laws haven't been used in ages. It took them a while to get rid of them because it just didn't matter.   But no, you made a great point that a country where gay marriage is legal is ""socially backwards"" compared to a country where simply *being* gay is *illegal*. Not to mention how persecuted religious minorities are in that second country, especially Jews. You basically cannot be a Jew in Lebanon, you would just die. But yeah, the US is totes backwards, and Lebanon is a fucking paradise because they're *considering* not murdering gay people. Everyone who lives in Tel Aviv thinks everyone else is a caveman. Think of New Yorkers, or people who live in places like London or San Francisco or Paris.   If I remember correctly the perpetrator was sent to prison for a pervious homophobic attack and when released he committed the stabbings.  It can be two things. He was homophobic.  > Also, if you're talking about throughout history it definitely goes both ways.   That's exactly my point.  The post i responded to said:  >Israeli's are racist against muslims  My point was that it goes both ways. I'm obviously talking generally, historically, and on a nation-state level. I don't need anecdotes about how some muslims and jews are friends. Technically, in terms of population, the world is still largely anti gay marriage and quite homophobic.  Yep! You're 100% correct. spread the fucking word brother. I'm not going to let my country devolve into rabid systematic persecution of muslims.  i doubt most people on this website have ever even heard of Lawrence v. Texas.  What possible reason is there for outlawing homosexuality that isn't basically a religious hold over?  True but you have to ask for the citizenship and not everyone does. Sometimes people just settle elsewhere and their children won't ask for the citizenship.   But I'd be curious to see the actual statistics!  I was born in the states, I don't have citizenship. I wish they changed the law to allow it to be passed down by mother as well Well you are because you asked for the citizenship. Most of the long-term diaspora don't  Jeez your head is really stuck in the sand.   See this pew research study, 80% of Lebanese do not believe homosexuality should be accepted. THATS 80 PERCENT MORON!!  http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/06/04/the-global-divide-on-homosexuality/  Now go fuck off and die and don't tell me I have no idea. Clearly you're just trying to have your own world view on the happy live and let live Muslim people put forward. But it's a false narrative.  I'd say let's put this fire out before we start worrying about the guy buying matches who may or may not start a fire  Hahahahaha you're funny... oh, and mistaken, come and see what the church does in Lebanon, and how opposed they are  to the least of rights which is the civil marriage. Religion should be personal, a country should never be ruled by any religion, politics and religion must be separated. Did you ever read what christianity did in the middle ages? All religions are bad when given power :) The 1967 Act covers homosexual acts in private between two men. In other words, acts not in private or involving more than two men were still illegal. This was a deliberate attempt to hinder the full legalization of homosexuality and thus the 1967 Act is often considered a partial decriminalization instead of a full legalization. The definition of in private was deliberately stretched so that, for example, having sex in a building like a house or hotel was considered a crime if there was another person in the building, even if said person was in a completely different room. The authorities continued to prosecute men for consensual adult sex under gross indecency between men up until 1996 at the latest. It was not until [A.D.T. v United Kingdom](http://worldlii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2000/402.html) in 2000 that homosexuality was *fully* legalized. It is worth nothing that even in the 21st century the government attempted to argue that these restrictions on homosexuality were justified. Have you ever left the USA?  Besides pleasure, homosexuality doesn't really add anything to our species as humans/animals. If someone was born with an extra chromosome is that normal? Perhaps they were born with no arms, would that be natural? That animals do it doesn't say it's natural, it's a distortion.  Let me make myself clear once again: I don't hate homosexuals, I think they're people who deserve to be respected and have a right to be happy like anyone else. Criminalizing homosexuality isn't the right thing to do IMHO but I don't agree with this drive to normalize it. My reasoning is quite clear: There's nothing natural about homosexuality. It's not how nature intended relationships and is a retarded version of human/animal sexuality. I don't believe in criminalizing it though and I don't hate homosexuals, they're people too. He said goats not whales No it's pretty 50/50 between both sides that refuse to see a bigger, blurrier picture.  Sometimes a thread is garbling Churchill's cock.  Sometimes a thread is wanting to piss on his bust.  The only consistency is that it's grossly binary. Sure it was, Israeli.  Sure that must be why faggotic netanyahu is scared as fuck of crossing hezbollah, so he sticks to beating women and children in gaza. Things can change quickly. Look at these polls from the US:  http://www.gallup.com/poll/1651/gay-lesbian-rights.aspx  As recently as 2003, 46% of Americans thought it should be illegal. Further, until the Supreme Court struck these laws down in 2003, it was still illegal to have gay sex in some states, like Texas. Even in 2016, 28% of Americans thought it should be illegal. Not that far off from Turkey, is it? There is definitely room for improvement. The point is that it's not as bad as people make it out to be. Remember that some people actually believe that gays are being lynched in the streets in the Middle East. Definitely true, but I can't help it :P So does the Bible. Your point? This is not true. Contrary to the clear legislation in most islamic nations (considering homosexuality) the Quran itself mentions homosexuality, at most, twice and without any clear prescribed treatment.  You can adhere to a religion and disagree with its leaders- Islam isn't Catholicism where one guy's word is law Yes the Quran and Islam provide horrible ideologies. Anyone who literally follows the hadiths and the Quran are horribly brainwashed people, who are horribly homophobic, misogynistic, and repressed.   Also the Iranian government is not moderate the clerical institutes of Iran, the Ayatollahs and Grand Ayatollahs are as conservative as anyone in the middle east.   The greatest counterbalance to Islamism is secularism and good governance. Its having state institutes that can educate people and promote rationalism instead of religion. Its abolishing any relation between religion and the state. Its repressing fanatical madrassas and Mosques and ""Charities"" and television personalities who promote fanaticism (and who are funded by Saudi Arabia and individuals in the arab gulf state). Its governments that can provide a stable middle class, and hope for the masses so they don't fall for the demagoguery of fanatics that gain support among the poor and uneducated. Culture can be decimated by fanatical barbarians, a stable and strong government can't.  Needs more bacon grease Yeah because the West never encouraged fanaticism during the Cold War, or protected and supplied arms for oil to Saudi Arabia and the other gulf states.  Goldfish have longer memories than your kind. No one is making the comparison with Lebanon except you - I am talking about America and America only where you seem to be hell bent on dragging in distractions to move the focus away from what I was talking about.  Honestly at this point almost everyone everywhere seems to think everyone else everywhere is a caveman.  There are people living without indoor plumbing in the US who are probably saying ""Those animals in Chicago are tearing each other apart."" Sorry I'm just really upset because of all the generalizations and Muslim hate I've been seeing. Don't mind me.   *looks at New Zealand*  Yeah, load of shit. yeah man lol fuck gay people amirite it's okay to put them in jail the usa done it a few decades ago!!!  You're gross, homophobe.  the fact that the majority of intimate relationships are between men and women, the fact that babies are born between conventional sex, the fact that all minorities have been discriminated against regardless of religion, the fact that it was in their culture to be opposed to it even before any religion, sorry the world isn't your neckbeard religion hating circle jerk, you sound ridiculous talking that stuff outside of r/atheism, well you sound ridiculous there but it's your safe space to be ridiculous They don't release statistics on the number of passport holders, which would be an accurate way of counting. Closest thing to a census we ever get is when elections come round and people (not the government) roughly tally the numbers. Lebanese Christians are as conservative (or homophobic), if not more, than Lebanese Muslims. Similarly, Christian African countries are as homophobic as Muslim African country. It's a matter of conservatism, not religion.   Source : I've lived in a Lebanon Who is the ""we"" here? And do ""we"" have to deal with these things one-by-one? Last time I checked there were multiple fronts to all issues.  Which is why there's always a fire to put out yea but islam is extra bad. its like chriatianity is herpes and islam is cancer. id rather deal with herpes than cancer.  Suprise: I'm not *from* the USA.   Have you?   I also still haven't heard which non-western country is supposed to be more liberal according to you. If homosexuality does or does not add something to the species is up for debate.  Being born with no arms or with an extra chromosome would, in a purely natural enviroment be a very detrimental trait that would make passing on your genes rather unlikely. So it might, in a sense, be 'Natural' but the expression of an error within the code or a mechanical failure in the gestation process.  Homosexuality on the other hand does not hinder the individual in its function in a natural enviroment, besides maby in the conscious choice to not procreate. But then, Individuals are not fitness-maximizers but adaption-executers..  Mankind has come quite a long way since they left the savannah, and many traits that might have been necessary for survival in a pre civilization society might no longer be of obvious use. Some people are 'Night Owls' - maybe because it was of use to have someone in the group stay awake at night, tending the fire and being on the lookout for predators?  Homosexuality might have had a similar kind of usefulness, maybe a natural form of population control? ... Why is there never a cultural anthropologist around when you need one? I am curious what definition you have of ""natural"". From oxford dictionnary: ""Existing in or derived from nature; not made or caused by humankind:"". Homosexuality totally fit the description, since it exist in other animal species. And why are again the drive to normalize it?  The coccyx doesn't add anything to our species, is it unnatural? Homosexuality **DOES** add to the survival of animal populations. If a small percentage of the population does not produce offspring in adulthood, it opens up possibilities to care for young members of the population whose  parents have died or were abandoned. This type of safety net is an advantageous trait in a species and is 100% absolutely normal. ""Natural"" isn't an opinion, feeling or point of view. It is quite literally appearing in nature (or in a given system - like society - without artificial input, but we are talking about animals so.. nature). And homosexuality does appear in nature. It may not be *natural to you* (in your ""system""), but that does not make it unnatural. Homosexuality also isn't an evolutionary dead-end (or backwards as you also imply) unless a whole species is practicing it exclusively, at the expense of reproductive sex. This hasn't been an issue in human history. So again, your feelings about it does not change the reality.  [Edit: Just to be clear, you have the right to your own opinion, but it's just that, an opinion.]  [Edit 2: What I meant in the first edit was; one has the right to their own opinion, but it is just that, an opinion.] > nature intended relationships   Nature doesn't intend shit. Nature **IS**. And gay sex is part of nature, hence it's natural.  Or wait, are those alternative facts? So how do you classify the animals that have homosexual sex in the wild?  I'd assume they count as 'nature'? Sounds about right He said Wales, not Norway Oh so you're one of the ones justifying the genocide, good to know. There is no blurry picture, Winston Churchill committed genocide, end of story. Tell me do you give Hitler the same luxary to see the so called ""blurry"" side of his story? I agree with your point, but the poll higher up says ""Being LGBT"" not ""having gay sex"". Not exactly the same. There's no Christian equivalent to Sharia Law in the world today  Agreed - the Qur'an when compared to the Bible is pretty innocuous when compared to the rulings created by the four madhabs which are based on the Qur'an, Sunnah, Hadith and Sira of Muhammad which is where the death penalty, floggings etc. occur. Hurr de hurr! I'm going to comment on an article about Lebanon with shitposts insulting Americans, and then call it a distraction when someone talks about Lebanon! Even though the article is about Lebanon! BrrrrrrrrrrRUPP! hahah. Yes. This is human nature. >A Religious Libel law remains on the statute books: Section 123 of the Crimes Act 1961 criminalizes blasphemous libel with a maximum sentence of one year. There is no record of a successful prosecution under this law, but it remains on the books.    >Severe discrimination  \\_()_/ Yo chill out dude Sounds like you really love neckbeards. You've basically listed 'religion, religion, and religion.' Sure, religion is a big part of culture, especially historical culture - but it's still perfectly irrational in many areas. Nobody gets up in arms about bachelors and infertile women, so the 'makes babies' argument is stupid.   I'll grant you that 'hatred of people who are different' is the root cause, more or less, but religions almost universally codify it into tradition and law.  See you gave my last comment a down vote but couldn't respond. Because you got owned mutha fuckaaaa My first comment related to the whole country. And my stats prove they are shit.   Fucking stop trying to continue a false narrative. We get it, you lived there and think you are some sort of champion for the brown people as you feel white guilt. But nevertheless, if they have these attitudes they can go fuck themselves, just like you can go fuck yourself.   Tell me what is ok with 80% of the population being unacceptable of homosexuality? Go on? It's there in black and white.  You seem to be taking the fire thing quite literally Hehe, nice way to put it, and the best would be not having to deal with either of the 2 :) Cheers. The USA is no way comparable in terms of political liberalism to Europe.  I'm British and live in the UK. I've lived in Amsterdam and India previously. I've also spent a decent amount of time in Lebanon. I'm not sure I understand your question or why you're asking it. > Homosexuality might have had a similar kind of usefulness, maybe a natural form of population control?  Interesting way to look at it. That's not how evolution works. Things don't have to contribute to survival or procreation to evolve in a species. Evolution is random mutations that end up sticking around typically because they don't fuck your shit up.  Homosexual tendencies don't get in the way of survival needs and they are still able and do procreate (ignoring the fact the trait doesn't appear to be hereditary in the first place). So there is no reason for it to go away. I have wisdom teeth, tonsils, and an appendix. Does that make me an unatural heathen too? If it's taken off, will you perish? It adds nothing. You're conveniently forgetting about heterosexuals that can provide care to young ones as well. Homosexuals could cease to exist today and the human race would move on, If heterosexuals ceased to exist today then humans will be extinct. > Just to be clear, you have the right to your own opinion, but it's just that, an opinion  Fair play.  BTW, I'm not looking to change reality. I don't care about changing anything. Don't have an issue with homosexuals whatsoever I just think it's a retardation of nature that's all. Your opinion. Not alternative facts. I said it's not natural, it exists but isn't the way it's supposed to be. He said goats, not sheep  You could've just said ""I'm a binary thinker that's incapable of seeing bigger pictures"" and saved yourself a lot of words. still both pretty horrible things to be punished for. Hell, it was only in 2002 that it was definitively ruled that states (namely Texas) couldn't enforce sodomy laws.  The Egyptian leadership was scared shitless when the Arab Spring happened. They used the military to removed Morsi and the general became president who is Mubarak buddies.  The current leadership jailing  people who speak out against the government with all kinds of bullshit laws.    I promise you the government don't give two fucks if there's homosexuals.   The government is flexing its authority to scare the population so they don't rise up.  I also blame the United State for not intervening and revoking the military aid.  Instead of supporting freedom the US got scared and AIPAC lobbied to ignore what's going on.    You're right but you're assuming Muslims all want shariah law, which is far from the truth. Also different groups of Muslims have different opinions on what that constitutes. The problem with asking if one supports Islamic law is that that's so vague a term that each respondent fills in the blanks as they see fit. It's like asking if Americans want a politician to got according to ""Christian principles-"" to my Christianity that would include a strong social safety net, universal healthcare, universal public Pre-K, etc. To Cletus Jim Bob Jones of Pig Nuts, Arkansas, that would probably involve banning homosexuality.  Biblical law is a thing. Where do you think the religious right get's all its horrific ideas from?  Also, the Vatican is a sovereign country that completely ruled by the church.  I'm agnostic, indifferent Coming from an agnostic, I believe religion is an awesome thing. One of the reasons I feel this way is because of neckbeard's online I've seen that try their best to try to convert everyone to 'atheism,' using nonsensical reasoning and comparisons. Religion is awesome, all of it. Or maybe I have a fucking life ? and I didn't downvote you  > My first comment related to the whole country. And my stats prove they are shit.  Well that's actually bad for your argument, considering 40% of Lebanese are Christians (and they used to be a majority, the country wasn't more progressive because of it).   > Fucking stop trying to continue a false narrative. We get it, you lived there and think you are some sort of champion for the brown people as you feel white guilt. But nevertheless, if they have these attitudes they can go fuck themselves, just like you can go fuck yourself.  > Tell me what is ok with 80% of the population being unacceptable of homosexuality? Go on? It's there in black and white.  I have no problem saying that Lebanon, or many muslim-majority countries have a problem with homosexuality and that it is very problematic and backwards. Still, Lebanon is probably the least bad of the bunch and you cannot solely judge a country by its social progressiveness, or else everything besides a few western countries ""is shit"". It was just like over there in the west only a few decades ago and mentalities are changing in the Muslim world as well, like they did in the west. They are a bit late, and they'll catch up (if we stop destabilizing them and promote radical Islamism to defend western interests).   Also I don't get where you get your ""white guilt"" bullshit from.  [removed] > non-western country   >Europe Err... no? You're conveniently forgetting that gay people don't lose the ability to reproduce with the opposite gender just because they're gay. Your hypothetical 'if everybody was gay, we'd go extinct' point to me shows a lack of critical thinking because a). All humans being gay isn't nor ever will be the case and even if it was, still wouldn't lead to the outcome you put forth, and b). It shows that you haven't ever considered homosexuality's potential biological/evolutionary use/benefit for existing *alongside* heterosexuality, and not just homosexuality existing inside a bubble like in your example. Well, they could go extinct. It's not like homosexuals are physically incapable of having heterosexual intercourse for means of procreation.  *edit There is no reason to downvote him for his opinion. It does add something to the conversation, even if it is a point of view one might disagree to. Didn't mean to hang you out, I meant it more general, not specifically against you. No opinion here, just extremely well documented facts.  Unless you mean it's my opinion that ""natural"" means ""appearing in nature"", but i guess that's a very common opinion :P Guess l don't understand what you're defining ""natural"" to mean, sorry.  Clearly it's not the same as the definitions I'm used to - which are along the lines of ""what happens in the wild without outside interference.""  Is it that you think there's a someone, somewhere, declaring what's 'supposed' to happen? I'm not your buddy, friend. You've got an awfully weird piece of cognitive dissonance going, but whatever. Have fun with that.  A country can be judged by its social progressiveness, what a shit thing to say that it shouldn't.   ""Oh no Saudi Arabia is great, they may not give women any rights, have slaves, stone homosexuals and etc, but all their people are well fed, so it's a great country"" - you do realize how ridiculous your statement is. If we can't judge a place on its progressiveness then where the fuck are we.  ""Apologist"" okay this is where I stop replying, you've clearly lived a very sheltered life.

No one thought to cut power? Every hotel I've seen has thin doors with small bolts, even if the lock is expensive. I would have thought that in ten or twenty minutes most people could break one open. * Cut the power.  * Reset the system.  * Install an other machine with the lock manager server and cut the other, then take power from the new one.  If none of these solutions work, the hotel has a good opportunity to sue the company making the system for endangering its clients. ""Correction: Due to a misunderstanding, it was stated that guests were locked in their rooms. This was not the case, as guests were free to leave at any time, however they were unable to re-enter their rooms.

Also the title was updated to  > Hotel ransomed by hackers as guests locked out of rooms  ... but reddit have cached the old one. That's what you get for allowing an integrated computer network in your ship... I mean hotel. I've been there. 1500 EUR is nothing. Should be about 7 room nights. Fascinating. I never thought about hotel door locks being hackable. Why would they not keep the key system isolated from the Internet? Seems an easy networking issue to fix.  This is such a brilliant idea they should get a medal for exposing stupid hotel security, and for making us all laugh. Why the fuck are the hotel door locks remotely accessible over the internet??? Hack a hotel, hold it ransom for 1,500 Euros.  1,5000 Euros.  Seriously brah?  1,500 Euros?  Come on mang.  What if fire? They could use for part of a black mirror episode I was once physically locked into a  compound hostel thing with a friendo. Was not happy. So did a lot of door kicking. Mid door kicking the hostel owner comes back and opens it up perplexed at why I would be furiously kicking the door down. Then I left.  I got locked in a hostel dorm room in Bangkok this summer.  It had key-card access to get in, and a button you had to push on the inside to get out.  During a big rainstorm the power was cutting in and out, and nothing was happening when I pushed the button to get out, even when the power was on.  A repairman had to come do something to the door from the outside.  There was no other exit in the room.  It was definitely a safety hazard, but it was also a Thai hostel, not a ""luxurious"" four-star Austrian hotel... A german article http://kaernten.orf.at/news/stories/2821290/ only speak of them locked out of their rooms, not locked in.  Plus it was the 4th time the hotel got hacked ... True but people in their room have the choice of staying with their belongings or being locked out from their room if they leave. If they leave the door ajar, they risk theft.  ""Correction: Due to a misunderstanding, it was stated that guests were locked in their rooms. This was not the case, as guests were free to leave at any time, however they were unable to re-enter their rooms.  The story has been edited accordingly.""  yea, except in url The article reports that guests were locked OUT of rooms, not in them as the title states.  Also, 1,500 euro is a pretty cheap ransom. The real problem with 'fake news' is that almost everything is fake news. Most stories are taken out of context or exaggerated. Maybe the hotel guests were a bunch of pussies and too scared to leave. Maybe dude just needed to buy a couple of CSGO skins. Assuming that figure is true I can only imagine they set it low so it would seem cheap in comparison to the alternative of paying repair bills after forcing entry into rooms and damaging the locks or doors, or for paying some guy to come out and open them in a non damaging way. And not just one door. Every single occupied room. That would presumably cost more than 1500 EUR. If the figure is accurate of course.  I would personally be very tempted to eat the cost and tell the guy to fuck off because I don't want to set a precedent that any little asshole can just shake me down for 1500 euros at will.    1500 EUR in bitcoin, so the potential upside is big without making a whole bunch of waves.  Yeah, seeing as Calgary University had to pay $30k USD to unlock their servers.  Sounds like this hotel needs to invest in an actual IT staff member. Willkommen im gasthaus kalifornien Such a lovely place Wow, that makes a lot more sense. They just couldn't make keys for a day. No one was locked in their room and all existing keys continued working.   With most keycard systems you are able to make fail-safe keys which to be used when the key system is down and new keys cannot be made. They only work for a short time and are supposed to get you through until the key system is repaired. That would have helped in a situation like this one   Also there is always the option to have staff escort guests to their room and open the door with a master key but that's inconvenient for everyone.  So they had a business critical system hosted on a single computer with poor security and no recent backups. Short version: Shitty IT security. We'll see such things more often in the next years. Especially as more and more devices are connected to the Internet and people continue to underestimate the risk they expose themself to by not applying or even care for proper IT security. Here it is:  It didn't. It's exaggerated bullshit, probably with large made up portions. So you are saying that at that ""large hotel in Los Angeles"", the doors are not connected at all to the network? If I lose my key the only way to revoke it is to personally go to the room and plug something to the door? How are new keys issued, or extended if you stay longer? Do they have to give you extra keys? That seems inconvenient...  Also, while that _might_ be true for your hotel, many are now offering to unlock the door from your smart phone, so I call bullshit on their security You are entirely incorrect. Google Safelok. Most hotels of any size have the lock system linked to the reservation system so cards are automatically created for the correct room and correct period.   This significantly reduces errors and speeds up check-in.   I've pentested several hotels. It's perfectly possible to secure the system issuing keycards without introducing an airgap. It's a fairly easy to solve problem.   On the flipside, I have done plenty of tests with ""airgapping"" on systems which is broken or improperly implemented. Especially common in mid-sized businesses without in-house IT. All it takes it a mis-patched cable. Or the vendor installing their own equipment to allow access.   Airgapping doesn't do anything against social engineering and physical access either. And in those instances, if you do get access you can almost certainly guarantee that they will be able to escalate privileges as the air gap will mean no updates have been applied, and it's highly likely additional security measures have not been applied.   Outside of the energy industry, it is pretty rare to see air gaps implemented and maintained.  Because it is Cybergibbons.  The kind whose owners didn't watch the Battlestar Galactica TV series, obviously. > On the fourth attempt the hackers had however no chance because the computers had been replaced and the latest security standards integrated, and some networks had been decoupled. Who says it isn't? It might be an inside job, so to speak. Or someone on the hotel wifi (stupid its not isolated, i know). system was designed and implemented by idiots. This is the correct question. A system doesn't need to be accessible from the internet to be attacked. It's likely that a client machine was infected - phishing or another client side attack - and it spread to other machines.  Fast money and the hacker thinks the hotel do not bother to report to police and get bad publicity. It probably just opened the other way. Doors like those (like the ones in hospitals) are normally kept locked with an electromagnet. If the power goes out, the doors unlock.  hostel in bangkok - you like to live dangerously. Welcome to Thailand lmao. Reminds me of Ex Machina. Form the catalogue ""The Hotel Of Things is already there! Experience the thrills of living in a full-featured Intelligent Hotel (Intelligent like in ""Intelligent design"") - It's so great you will not be able to leave.. Hacked already four times - will you be the fifth master hacker? Come and hack your way out!"" So take your shit and leave? Why would anyone stay in the hotel after this? The hack didn't target the guests, this was meant to halt business for the hotel itself. The hackers were only asking for about $1500 Euro, which is definitely enough for a four-star hotel to be like, ""Fuck it, it's cheaper to pay them now than recovery from loss of business."" It was a safe gambit from the hacker's perspective because it was such a low ransom. This kind of thing would get taken care of in a matter of hours, and wouldn't really adversely effect the guests for any meaningful length of time. Telling him to fuck off doesn't help if he still has your computer system by the balls. Yeah, I know BTC is relatively anonymous but I think such a small amount could have been an attempt to be discrete. Although, they could have just demanded several payments of a smaller amount if this were the case.  Performance by Die Engles There's plenty of room  > They just couldn't make keys for a day. No one was locked in their room and all existing keys continued working.  Only a few hours actually because they paid the ransom I imagine it might be..  The idea of rooms having doors that cannot be manually opened from within or manually overridden with pass keys from outside when the computers go down seems a bit suspicious as well as incredibly dangerous for the guests so that would be my first red flag that this might be fake.  Second.. Even the most modern hotels in the US must all have bypass key access and manual actuators that can unlock/open any door from either side in the event of an emergency..  This tech is industry standard so unless this hotel prides themselves on having something crazy exotic like EM bolt/locks and vault doors, this would be the second red flag that this might be fake.  Finally.. I could easily see how a bit of well placed malware could potentially reset/scramble the door card readers..  Its actually a known thing to happen in US hotel hacks, but it's hardly a hack at the scale this story implies and would be rather easily fixed without paying a ransom.  They probably have staff who on night shift watch videos on pirate sites, download the odd file and provide access to the outside by not updating the system.   The hotel has been targeted 3 times so it probably happened once, when unencrypting the files probably installed a backdoor to repeat at a later date.  if u lose ur keys, front desk makes you a new pair using the device. Idk if that renders the old ones worthless or not. Im not sure how the whole system works but it's definately not connected to a network. When the battery in the lock died, I'd have to go replace them and reprogram it with the device using multiple security keys. My patrols consisted of sliding a battery test card in each door to see if the battery was low. If it was connected to a network I would not need to check the doors of every room in a 24 story hotel. Shit it wouldve made my job much easier.  The  ""might"" you inserted in there was pretty unnecessary; what the fuck are you trying to imply? that Im bullshitting? Or that I can't recall a job I performed multiple times  a day for 2 years.  Was the hotel old? Yea. Could there be other modern systems that use a network? yea, no shit.  I still don't think there would be a way to lock someone inside; it's impractical, dangerous and probably illegal under false imprisonment laws.    At most hotels the room locks are not connected to the network. They get programmed by a device that either inserts into the card slot or plugs in to a port on the lock. I don't know how RFID locks are programmed....probably via RFID  If someone loses their key and needs a new one, the hotel makes a new key and once it's used in the lock, the old one is no longer valid. If someone extends their stay, they will need to get a new key from the front desk as their existing keys are already coded with the checkout date.   There are some systems that allow for all room locks to be connected to a central system, so maybe that's what happened here.   Also with mobile keys where you can open with your phone, usually it's integrated with an app from the hotel brand. The app receives the key somehow (sent directly from hotel to your account and accessed via the app or text/email a link to download) and it's similar to an existing room key where it's only valid for your room and expires on the checkout date.  Wtf does that even mean? On the fourth attempt. Fool me once, twice, three times, shame on you? Didn't read the article, huh?  It's mentioned after the third attack they got their shit together and upgraded the latest security standards, and some networks had been decoupled. So they did what they should have done in the first place and made the door system stand-alone. Nope. It was a straight up lock. Like the kind you would get for a footlocker. Like a master lock that was latched to the door.  he got lucky and had power but the button didn't work. or is that unlucky? Ive worked with setups which had battery backup for the magnet alone, which is possible here. (The key system would have its own too)  However, I've always seen them wired with either an emergency button to cut the power to the lock, or the release button would cut power.  Here, it looks like they cheaped out. So there we have another attack vector.. You have a point, I was just trying to say that people that are in their room effectively have to stay in those rooms if they want to see out their stay.  They paid the ransom very quickly so no one needed to leave. But if that hadn't happened there is non miniscule chance that there are no rooms at other hotels either, as this hotel was fully booked. But by paying the ransomers you give them an incentive to keep doing this to others.  But yes, I agree. The hotel needs to think about their guest relations and probably paid the ransom and alerted the authorities afterwards. In most countries computer related crimes like this are treated very seriously and would warrant investigation by the equivalent of something like the FBI. For a few hundred euros I don't think it's worth it > wouldn't really adversely effect the guests for any meaningful length of time.  pretty debatable depending on circumstances, like if you needed to get your shit so you could leave for the airport or take medication... I mean, it could suck to get locked in your room for two hours if you had an appointment or something. Die Adler Essen mein scheisse ....Whats the name of the place again? Yeah, sorry about that ""might""... I was indeed implying that you were bullshitting, and now I feel bad. Google is a website where you go to search the internet.    Safelok is the name of a company that sells computerized locks to all major hotel brands and it does not require a programmable device to change the keycards.  Rather, it uses a computer that is hooked up to all the door locks which are in turn all connected to the network and read information from that server.    It is incredibly easy to lock out people from their rooms or simply unlock all the doors in the hotel that are using that system if you have access to that server.   Can't get fooled again. Thanks I see. BBC articles get updated often after the 1st post, so I wasn't aware. > that people that are in their room effectively have to stay in those rooms if they want to see out their stay.  Some may. I personally would pack up and leave and get a refund from the hotel. I'm easy going, don't want to be a self-inflicted prisoner. ;) doing it to others, or keep doing it to the same hotel.   Thats most likely why it was the 3rd time it had happened. Which is great if they're in the country, not so much if they're over tor and living in some eastern euro country My man, read the damn article.  > Yet according to the hotel, the hackers left a back door open in the system, and tried to attack the systems again. On the fourth attempt the hackers had however no chance because the computers had been replaced and the latest security standards integrated, and some networks had been decoupled.   Duden, nein... I'd look it up, but my head feels heavy, my sight is growing dim... I should stop for the night.  Bread & Breakfast Nevada Don't feel bad, Im an asshole. You mentioned nothing  about ""locking people in their rooms""   Interpol, then.  I'm sure they have some kind of cybercrimes unit. European police cooperate with M each other.  Das ist meine Marmelade! Maybe you should call the captain and ask. Totally. Dont drive while tired, its dangerous. You could crash and end up all dangerous and twisted.

Oh awesome! Now we can buy all those great Russian products we've so long been denied! Can't think of what Russia actually produces for American markets... except half the country's political opinions. The Don is such an obedient little puppet. Trump is such a lapdog it's not even funny anymore Putin is laughing at the chaos his little puppet is causing. If we all bought in to what Reddit was saying you would be 100% positive Putin is the leader of the U.S. right now. Calm the fuck down. This bs will be the pretext for removing sanctions. Probably say like we have agreed on less nukes.  What Russia has that interests the US? And what does the US wants to export to Russia?  Traitors running our government. Russia is really pushing to become a world power. They want to use Trump to hobble us, divide us and remove us as a world leader. I'm not pro global policing but if you leave it to Russia to intervene, I think we'll find the world a much darker place. Are you a Russian?  As a 50 year old guy I can say that I want to be friends with your country.  Trump is tearing down the things that make America powerful and influential-soon that pathetic petrostate really will be our equal. ""MR PRESIDENT!  STOP SUCKING ~~THE AMBASSADOR'S~~ PUTIN'S DICK!"" Trump sees Russia as a military sub-contractor in a part of the world he's too scared to tread himself. In order to get their agreement to fulfill this role (which will allow them both to bully equally) he needs to flatter them a bit and appease their own sense of inflated self regard and nationalism. Trump's whole business model is based around licensing his name and therefore taking risks with other people's money. This is just an extension of it  Trump will trade sanctions for co-operation and offer Russia a share of the spoils in return for their labour (""take their oil""). One of his prizes is going to be Iran. Russia would represent a significant element of risk to this contract. The best way of ameliorating that risk is to make them a partner in a joint enterprise  I actually suspect that Trump wouldn't mind going right after the snakes head actually, but there has to be a fair prospect that Pakistan has made that particular expedition extremely hazardous. It's probably going to require an expendable force to provoke that one, and Russia sits on good intelligence and won't be about to play stupid    Trumps Muslim ban is getting much more airplay than, Trump calls Putin on the phone.  Must be worrisome for the cold war mentality toward Russia crowd. When they meet for the first time Puty should get straight to the point, shove his fist up his puppets ass, and just start  moving the goons lips, ""oh it's wonderful..."" Guess US has now turned into a Russian puppet state. It was a nice run. Trump is so mentally ill and delusional that he actually thinks he's doing the right thing with this.  He's outmastered on every level by the psychopath called Putin. Putin would be absolutely stupid to trust America, especially the Republican party.  Congratulations deplorables, your leader is as big an asshole as we all thought he was.  Honestly as a US Soldier the best thing i could see is military tolerance between the US and RUS.  We are sick and tired of being enemies when working together could eliminate the global terrorst threat in a fortnight.  Also if Russia and the US worked together economically, this could beneift our oil prices, precious metal prices, and benefit the globe economically.    I support Trump in trying to better our ties with Russia.  They aren't the Soviet Union anymore, they aren't our enemy anymore.  As a globe we need to begin unification and reconstruction of infrastructure and damages caused by the Cold War and past conflicts in places like Asia and Africa.  Politics is out of the question here.  Whether you are a Conservative or Liberal anywhere in the world, we need this. I'm sure Russia would love to get its hands on few F35 joint strike fighters. Do we want to place bets on when he lifts the sanctions?  I say sometime in the next week.  It is really great the only friendly voices Trump hears are Putin and Bannon. I'm literally waiting for the episode where Sterling Archer discovers that Trump is a KGB sleeper. Rex Tillerson's economic ties, yes? only thing I agree with him on Were republicans *not* claiming Obama was too soft on foreign policy with Russia or did I dream that?  Can Trump voters finally admit they were played? Your nationalism and patriotism blinded reality.  >Mutually beneficial trade  They arent talking about countries here, they're talking about personal trades We are in the Fallout Timeline.   Get ready for them powersuits boys. Can you be someones ""equal"" when they have a video of you getting peed on by Russian prostitutes? Except Russia is not our equal and elevating them provides Putin unnecessary leverage.  Well, Putin did just give Trump ownership of 20% of Russia's most profitable energy corporation. Of course when you are able to bribe the president you are going to get benefits. WE ARE NOT FUCKING EQUALS Senate Communists from Red States are all for it.  What a fuckin idiot.  If he genuinely thinks that's the conversation he had with Putin he's in for a dry ass fucking with vinegar.  Furthermore, if he thinks we think that's the conversation he had with Putin then he's certainly stupid enough to think Putin 'agreed' to anything.  Good fucking luck Donald Chump. 'okay Trump, I need you dismiss the senior heads of the state Dept, fire all ambassadors without replacements ready and then kick the joint chiefs off the natsec council. Then we can talk' Dear everyone talking about equals as though the implication is that the USA and Russia are equals by all metrics. Equals is about respect. For instance, the Queen of England does not expect the US President to bow before her. They are equals.   Traditionally, a commoner would not be allowed before a royal without a bow. However he is the President, her equal on the world stage and therefore is not expected to bow.   By Reddit rules though (if this thread were the rule book), the Queen would be required to curtsy until her legs snapped every time she met the President. His economy is about 6 times larger by all estimates, his military has about 10 times as much money so by reddit standards, the Queen is far from Trump's equal, rather his subordinate.   Putin is the President of a Sovereign Republic whether you like it or not. Trump is the President of a Sovereign Republic whether you like it or not. Both are by law the Head of State. They are equals, regardless of who has more actual power.  Fuhrer Drumpf is a Russian puppet plain and simple. Both are fascists that embrace patriarchal misogyny and racism. Putin will always hang that golden shower tape over Drumpf's head, and Drumpf will dance to do his bidding. I don't like Trump, but this is actually s good thing.

The only reason they are are considered a world power is because of their nukes.  As solar becomes more important their GDP will continue to shrink.  Essentially their only real export is military de-stabilization on a world wide basis. $17 trillion = $2 trillion + $15 trillion peepee tape Blow up a bridge in Iraq with a $1 million bomb and spend $1 million to rebuild that bridge, GDP goes up by $2 mill, but is america better off? If only all countries would respect each other as equals no matter the size of their economy, military or anything else. GDP is such a great number to compare countries.   Guess what.  http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/usa/ http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/rus/ Russian - export - 450B, USA - exprot -  $1.45T. Basicaly 1/3. What about population ~145m/ 318.9, 1/3. HM, kinda same amount of export/population. Interesting. What about export/import, Russia positive trade balance of $154B, USA negative trade balance of $731B. If you don't understand - this is kinda Russia's potential as trade partner, market you can potentialy get. So who's more interested in trading relationship.  And about this sacred Grail - GDP. Russia GDP/export = $1.86T/ 449B = ~ 4. USA GDP/export = $17.4T /$1.45T = ~ 12. Interesting...  Let's say Jhon sell apple to Ben for 1$. Their total GDP is $1. But now Jack buy apple from Jhon for 1$ and sell it to ben for 1,2 as a apple juice or some shit (to play with definition of final product). Their total GDP now became 2,2. Wow, double GDP. Wanna guess, who to tripple this number? Is this like suggesting people who earn more money are somehow better than people who earn less and are therefore not equal? What does that have to do with anything? Russia is a military power, notan economic power. Stating Californias GDP is also implying all 50 states have a similar GDP to it (which some definitely don't). Why is Russia's GDP so low? Even before the sanctions that's pretty abysmal. Yeah russia won the isis war Putin is getting paid off. And we are just gonna watch it happen. Wow: when your nation extends an olive branch, you are just right there to light that branch on fire. The only thing comparable with the US is the EU and Trump has been spitting in its face by flirting with right wing anti-EU groups. Russia and USA can pretty much beat everyone on this planet. 2 world government  Your mistake is using neorealist measures of power to conclude that the US is the hegemon purely because of our GDP.    Purely Military and economic measures of power havent been enough to decide a hegemon since ww1 and 2.    You now have to take into consideration soft power, influence over international organizations, ability to advance interests and essentially ""get their way"".  We have arguably been declining in our status as the only superpower of a unipolar system since the oil crisis of the 70s when a group of nations with a MUCH lower gdp, and practically no armies that were a threat to the US managed to pretty much bring us to our knees just by putting their fingers in our oil tap. That's the issue with Americans. You measure everything in money.  I still consider people who earn 1/20 of my income as my equals, if they are not jerks or share my interests. Hell, I have a friend who is 'between jobs' for over 5 years, and his annual income is maybe 1/100 of mine.   As if Americans treat Chinese as equals, despite the similarity of GDP. GDP/total debt is the adjusted quantity to use when comparing leveraged economies. ""People Who Give Me Money And Then Maybe America First"" You can't make America great again, until you completely destroy it first. Well except for his boss he meant. Well at this point where is even the difference between America and Russia?  Mutually beneficial doesnt negate ""America First"". That's a shallow campaign slogan.  ""Trump First"" is the reality.  just becasue you put america first doesnt mean you cant have allies. it seems you are arguing over rhetoric rather than the point America is an Alternative First debt..Trumps by your standard we shouldn't treat any other nation as an equal MAD makes them our equal militarily. They are the only country which is an actual threat to us.  They are both sovereign countries, why would you need any other reason? They're a nuclear equal. No one is militarily or economically equal to US, but that is not a reason to act like a bully. > Russia is in no way a economic or military equal? Why treat it that way?  Because they apparently have pictures and video of the US president in bed with hookers. It seems like we're supposed to treat every country as our equal until it comes to Russia.  Because Trump is a traitor and a Russian puppet.  That is absolutely the answer. Don't kid yourself: we're being governed by Russia, by proxy. I suppose if he had approached it from a position of being superior, this would have been evidence of Trump's egotism. trump makes $$$ in russia. guess where miss universe is Any nation with nuclear capabilities especially should be treated as an equal threat. It is 100% a military peer. Its nuclear arsenal make it the second most militarily powerful nation on Earth. Because in the up coming war with Asia US will need its old ally back on their side /tinfoilhat The same way you and I are equal? It's hilarious how obvious trumps corruption/idiocy are. Do you know how trade deals work? It's not about GDP, it's about the deal itself. But so is the rest of the world? If the US compared itself to any country it would be better economically and militarily, and not just by a small margin. Australian GDP is lower, its militarily weaker yet the US has been very intrested in it for a long time. A lot of people like to shit on Trump but he said he would like to stabilise relationships with Russia ages ago. Either American's don't care or are ok with treating Russia as Trump would expressed he would. Exactly, Putin wants to feel Russia is equal to America and is stating that as a prerequisite to better relations.  Russia is deserving of respect and consideration, and inclusion, but is not entitled to equal footing with America in all things. Why do we treat our allies as equals? are you somehow saying USA is superior to other countries? That's being a racist BIGOT Because Trump is Putins bitch. Agreed. USA should treat all other countries as inferior, because they are weaker.  Trump's got to keep it sweet with his boss.  Obviously it's meant figuratively.   I'm more surprised that it was a phonecall and not a Twitter exchange. If those other countries started to pay Trump and use Trumps services I am sure he would be more than happy to open up free trade. His motto is Trump First after all. Except that isn't at all what he said. He said he wants to make individual deals, not clumped packages like TPP. The mental gymnastics you people need to go through now to support TPP is ridiculous. Someone should tweet this at Trump Don't forget Mickey Dick ""Daddy"" Pence! [removed] Allienating China is a different subject to buddying up with Russia. Good relations with both countries would be the best scenario. How is bettering relations with Russia alienating China?   A trade deal is also being worked on for the UK, is that alienating anyone?  Foreign trade doesn't have to be a zero sum game.  Trump would sell out the US for the chance to build a hotel across from the Kremlin. He'd consider it his best trade of all time. His whole life revolves around putting his name on visible buildings. All of trump's and trumps family assets had better be seized when he's finally impeached.  This is fucking absurd. I get the joke, but for the sake of reducing ignorance. [source](http://www.worldstopexports.com/russias-top-10-exports/).  1. Gems, precious metals: $7.4 billion (2.2% of total exports)  2.

Russia is neither our economic, trade, or military equal but they have a massive landmass full of exploitable resources. They only reason they are even considered a world player is because of their past significance and it's legacy living on through their nuclear arsenal.   Russia doesn't control the U.S. and even if they did have the president in their pocket, it wouldn't do much to restore them from the destitute, mafia ridden pit of despair that it is. The best they could do is get the sanctions lifted so they can be restored to the meandering existence they once had.  camgirls, tracksuits, alcoholism and despair  A lot of Russian machinery is actually built really well, like American stuff from the 20s before planned obsolescence became a thing well. It may not work the best, but it'll work, and work for a good long time. There's a definite market for it. Also, lots of raw materials, potentially including rare earth metals, which with a trade deal could provide a viable competetor to Chinese REMs. 7n6 When was it funny? Funny you should mention that. Not even a month ago, both Trump and Putin were huffing and puffing about building up nuclear weapons. Vodka  Bourbon A large consumer market and the largest reserve of untapped mineral and fossil fuel wealth in the whole world. Divide you and remove you as a world leader? WTF are you talking about? The military power of the U.S. is unrivaled. How will bettering relations with Russia lead them to removing the U.S. as a world leader? What extreme scenario have you thought up? :/ Russia has been extremely successful in dividing the west.  Brexit, Trump, causing racism against eastern europeans in eu member states, causing racism against refugees, sowing the seeds of american withdrawal from nato.  The US is either on the path towards failure (continued conservative rule, or maybe even just the existence of them in the country) or to a new revitilization as the world leader if we can get some progressives/rational people in power. Everyone, including Obama, laughed when Mitt Romney said our biggest threat is Russia. Not so funny now is it.   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kwQqNdkyZZo  No, they won't.   For Russia to attempt to become the US's equal, they would need a more productive population, which means a better educated population, both of which imply less corruption, which means less money for Putin and friends.  What benefits Russia doesn't automatically benefit Putin. ""No let him finish. There will be drilling in the arctic."" Or Trump is a Russian puppet and a fool. I don't know, he just made an executive order about military plans for fighting ISIS in thirty days. This to me seems like he's setting himself up for embarrassment if he doesn't do *something*.  Yeah I'm starting to think that he is literally delusional. I already knew he was a pathological liar and possible clinical narcissist. Why would anyone think that bettering relations between those two countries is a bad thing? Is the recent anti-Putin Western propaganda engraved in your mind so hard that you cant see even that bettering relations is a good thing? The guy isnt a saint by any stretch of the imagination but that doesnt make him a psychopath (lol) either. Putin is pretty scary. How he rose to power is mind boggling. And how he stayed in power is a farce - installing a puppet as president and demoting himself as prime minister then coming back as the president to circumvent the constitution.  He doesn't need to trust them, he fucking owns them now. He literally doesn't trust America.  Bush invading Iraq, coupled with the incompetent handling of the Afghan war, convinced Putin and the STAVKA that America is incapable of providing peaceful leadership globally.  The final stroke that made Putin decide to work to destabilize the West was McCain and Bush standing in Tbilisi like fucking idiots praising the Georgians, and when the Georgians attacked South Ossetia it was game on.  **Edit:** Oh, and Bush's insistence on putting the missile shield in Central/Eastern Europe...to defend against *Iranian* missiles.  Of course, Putin's insistence that Eastern Europe should not join NATO is more of a self-fulfulling prophecy of Russian paranoia and aggression, but that also contributed. Nah sorry but our guy doing stuff he said he would do that you don't like doesn't make him an asshole to us. We're actually really excited. And that you literally didn't even consider that we would want the things we're promised and are seemingly ignorant as to what that is is pretty hilarious. Do you know literally anything about his policy or is it all Russian puppets and grabbed pussies? If you're going to have a meltdown, might as well get a little bit educated while you're at it. Thank you for your service.   However, it is ridiculous to suggest you can eliminate the global terrorist threat with military force. Terrorism is a civilian act specifically tailored to evade military counter-action. There are only three ways to truly end terrorism  are: 1) genocide; 2) mongol-level brutal oppression by a permanent occupying force; and 3) long-term co-opting via partnership, education, and cultural alignment. Neither force-based solution is available to the US military. The Russians are experimenting with both options right now. The US hasn't tried the third option in the Middle East.  They can't do anything. They have awful force projection capability. Were they as good as everyone says, and as devoted to beating isis as people seem to think, they wouldn't have allowed isis as much territory in Syria as they got. They left fighting isis to the coalition and the Kurds, while they bombed the ""rebel"" forces in Syria. They haven't done a damn thing in the fight against isis.     What can Russia offer us? How is this ""America first""?  > We are sick and tired of being enemies when working together could eliminate the global terrorst threat in a fortnight.  We tried this in 2009.  Russia promptly just pissed in our eye.  And now you want to try it again.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_reset  Hint: Russia isn't interested in being our ally. >We are sick and tired of being enemies when working together could eliminate the global terrorst threat in a fortnight.   Yes what we need is more military force, that'll end the terrorism! /s  Russia has no interest in being an ally with America, Trump is being played an absolute fool and in doing so will endanger all those in Russian sphere of militray influence.    >  We are sick and tired of being enemies  And when is the last action you personally partook in against Russia? >  global terrorst threat in a fort night  Unless you plan to exterminate Muslims there is no way to eliminate a threat. It is not a war that can be won in a conventional sense. Just like the civil rights movement didn't end racism you can't eliminate an ideology.     All due respect, if Russia has Trump in a blackmail situation, or even just a conflict of interest involving his business, this is not a relationship of equals.  This is Trump and Putin raiding the refrigerator at our expense > They aren't the Soviet Union anymore, they aren't our enemy anymore.  Crimea. What the fuck do you do in the military that you think you can eliminate terrorism in a fortnight? Are you actually even in the military? Only someone completely out of touch thinks terrorism is something we can defeat by brute force.  Peace and reconciliation all good. But how about russia fueling and inciting civil wars to carve out territory - ukraine and georgia? Dutch children who were blown to pieces midair by russian missile? It happened just a couple years ago not during cold war.  No chance it'll happen this soon. A LOT of Republicans are not going to let this happen. Trump said that he was going to do this pretty much at every single rally.  This is exactly what Trump voters voted for.      On the flip side, *Hillary* was the one who was flushing Russian relations down the toilet.  It's *her* supporters who are bitching and moaning about this now.  The Republican elite doesn't like Trump. And he had already said in his campaign that [he would use Russia to fight ISIS](http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/29/donald-trump-let-russia-fight-isis-syria/). This isn't anything new Trump supports *support* peace with Russia.   did you live under a rock for the election? No that timeline was if Hillary won.  Trump seems to want peace with Putin. Makes your ass look great tho. I've seen this theory get floated around for the past few days. I sincerely hope someone can prove this to be true so we can impeach his ass. You are right. USA will be first to formalize Sharia law at this rate. yes, you particulary are lower How's Putin ""embracing racism""? I'm very curious to know.  Yeah, that just shows how incompetent Obama was: offer a prop reset button with one hand, then foment a coup-d'etat in Russia's closest ally with the other hand.    No wonder it blew up in his face.

Yeah except Mexico is our 3rd (maybe 2nd?) largest trading partner, a neighboring country and an ally with a similar GDP to Russia whilst Russia's economy is declining (partly due to sanctions and partly because the country is mostly a glorified gas station) and they've never really been that trustworthy in the first place. Doing business with Mexico isn't going straight into Putin's pocket so he can go for the $200 billion dollar mark in his personal bank account either.  For civilized society you'd think avoiding that insane level of corruption would be a bit of a plus. We aren't civilized anymore. So this is probably okay now. Mexico is one of our biggest trading partners simply due to geography, same with Canada. And we trade a bunch with them. Why not Russia. Most available numbers are from before the sanctions. But yes, their GDP shrank by massive amounts. Which is why they were so terrified of a Clinton presidency. Because Democrats wrecked them pretty harshly after Ukraine.    Okay the up-to-date figure [$1.3 trillion](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/gdp/forecast). The figure I gave was from Google which only goes to 2013. No wonder Putin was so determined to get his man in the White House! Yeah but with American cooperation and lessened sanctions, it could be considerably bigger I was using Google, updated in another comment.  2 Trillion data was from 2013, before the exchange rate.  GDP nominated in RUB fell by about 5-6% from 2013, not by 40%. They've got a lot of other stuff too. And a lot of nukes. So even if they got rid of their nukes they have more nukes. And backup nukes.  I thought military destabilization on worldwide basis was US's thing. Am I wrong? Russia is playing catch up in this game. And russian mail order brides too > is because of their nukes.  yup, that's right.  That's just how many nukes they have, too.  And how much damage they can do, yup. Building the bridge in Iraq would increase the GNP but not the GDP. [Broken window fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window) People that earn less aren't equal in certain aspects though, mainly income.   Logic.  What? This is about trade, not personality. They keep belittling Russia and they wonder why the Russians lash out. Just show respect and keep the peace. > Stating Californias GDP is also implying all 50 states have a similar GDP to it  Wrong. If it was actually ""America first"", he would've banned the Saudis.  When you hit rock bottom, the only way is up. That sounds like something Steve Bannon would actually say. Americans can still fight back. Like our allies in the EU and NATO???? The phone call:  Putin: ""pay denbts""  Trump: ""k bby"" Pee pee tape  trumps own little Super PAC > They are the only country which is an actual threat to us  Any country with modern nukes is. I just realized how amazingly short sighted, ignorant, and hateful it is to even have the idea of destroying the world. Literally ending the only place in the known universe to harbor life of any kind over a dick waving contest. Killing each other over disagreements because we can't get our way. I have always known of the MAD acronym and implications, but for some reason, it just hit me how petty and disgusting it is.  Sure they can instantaneously vaporize us, but are they a long term threat to our freedom or economic way of life? No  China on the other hand is both.   Russia is a washed up power, they are little more than North Korea with oil, missiles, The bomb.  So what? Soft power and conventional forces and economy wise they aren't, and that's what matters when it comes to trade.No one trades nukes.    Yet Trump tries to bully Mexico and acts servile to Russia.  There is a huge space between artificially treating a country as if they can make us capitulate, and being a bully.  >but that is not a reason to act like a bully  Like Trump is bullying millions of refugees? Or Mexico? Or 19 year olds on Twitter? I think the hostile intervention in the election is reason not to treat them as ""equal""... You mean the oligarchy diametrically opposed to our core principles?  The one we've been butting heads with since the end of WW2?  That one? 100 Russian words by tomorrow tovarish, don't bother showing up if you haven't learned them. No.  Russia is really the only country that could plausibly destroy the US in a nuclear exchange.  Other nuclear powers either don't have the capacity to strike the US mainland (Pakistan, India, North Korea, etc), or could be safely neutralized through a first strike (China, France, Israel, etc).  Russia can definitely attack the US mainland and definitely cannot be neutralized in a first strike.  It is also the only country to have anything close to nuclear parity with the US (in terms of the number and yield of warheads and in terms of the sophistication of delivery systems). See this is silly.  Countries don't use MAD as a bargaining tool any more.   Kim Jong Un will be so happy. That's why he is crying ""look I got nukes."" Like Pakistan? Pretty sure they're on the banned list.  Russia has a shit military, especially compared to the US.  Bodies are cheap in Russia, but its technology is far behind and falling apart.  Just because it can bully a smaller, essentially-bankrupt neighbour at a moment that it has political instability, doesn't mean it's a peer to the US. When and with whom? I don't understand what the means in context to Russia's economic strength compared to the US? Because they kiss the boot. So why make individual deals? What makes them so much better than multi-lateral trade deals? What benefit does negotiating 100 deals with 100 countries have over negotiating 1 deal with 100 countries? What advantage does it serve? Why would the EU want to have 1 free trade agreement amongst its member nations instead of hundreds of trade deals?  I'm indifferent to the TPP. I didn't see it as inherently a problem. Sure there were parts I didn't agree with but I didn't feel it was overly harmful. I have been ever since info about it came out. So interesting to see what you immediately assume about me. Reddit is full of trump haters, regardless of any of his actually good policies. Don't even try reasoning. These wannabeliberals have gone completely mental this election. I'd like to call myself liberal but then I'd be grouped with those same retards that still think ""grab em by the pussy"" is an argument and that ""russia uses pisstapes to blackmail Trump"". How am I supposed to side with this gibberish? On it. [removed] it really amazes me how so many people don't seem to understand this simple fact.  agreed.  > Good relations with both countries would be the best scenario.   Did I miss a memo? Has Russia stopped waging war in East-Ukraine and given back Crimea to the country they took it from?     two separate issues. there is no reason we can't have strong relations with both countries.  > How is bettering relations with Russia alienating China?  It doesn't have to be, but Trump is busy alienating China as well.  However, bettering relations with Russia is directly in conflict with better relations with the European Union. You can only pick one, and Trump is picking the wrong one. But these are global totals.  How much of these are US imports?  Also the article mentions:  From a continental perspective, 57.1% of Russian exports by value are delivered to European countries while 35.6% are sold to Asian importers. Russia ships another 3.2% to North America. And oil should double after the deal  Oh please Detroit throws that much shit in the trash on an average Tuesday, yes gems and all You forgot arms. We could buy half-way decent fighters from them. Boy, that would be ironic.  Also dashcam videos. Don't forget legalized domestic violence! And BOWLING! The US mines more than Russia, and we have Australia as well. We don't need to prostrate ourselves to weaker nations when we have allies who'll be willing to trade.  Do you have examples? Brands? Rare earth metals are only rare because it takes slave labor to get them out of the ground.   During the primaries I guess.  > both Trump and Putin were huffing and puffing about building up nuclear weapons.  Russia is replacing old nuclear weapons with newer ones (one of which that can carry like 24 nukes). They pretend the removal of outdated weapons and play it like something major. If it was truly about less nuclear weapons Russia should completely abandon and dismantle the new RS-28 Sarmat system. ;) Ok but aside from billions upon billions of dollars in trade and decreased global tensions what could we possibly have to gain from not going to war with a country with nukes? Haha I have thought up a few extreme ones yeah. I suppose hinting at a Russian-Trump cooperation to smear all other candidates so that he gets the election is extreme enough. Except it's more than a hint. Lets hope its the latter. I do know actually a few conservatives that feel the same way. Its more about throwing out the political shills, crypto-fascists and climate deniers. Its funny how most Trump voters thought they were doing just that.   Finally somebody gets it, all of these things were secretly orchestrated by a cabal of  shadowy ~~Jews~~ Russians!!  They were responsible for all our failings all along ( `) !! Russia doesn't have to raise itself up-Trump and the GOP only need to tear us down.  One president (Bush, anyone?) can do a lot of damage Are you calling Trump frigid? Well its certainly been suggested enough times, I just tend to think its being massively over played. Personally I'm more persuaded by the explanation that the two of them have a lot more in common than perhaps its comfortable to admit. On the horse shoe of the political philosophy, they're just as likely to emerge as collaborators as protagonists. If there's a puppet and puppet master role at all, then its more likely that Trump can pull the strings  It's perhaps worth taking a look at Putin through the influences of Russian political history to try understand where he fits. People keep saying he used to run the KGB and extrapolate that he's therefore a communist etc In the first case Putin's KGB rank was Lieutenant Colonel. Some dissidents suggest he was actually only a Major. He never ran it.   I think in the rush to scream 'commie' its easy to overlook that Russian revolutionaries were drawn from a range of different influences. They were extremely factionalised and had an enduring lineage into the Soviet era. Not all revolutonaries were communists working towards the dictatorship of the proletariat Not all communists were Bolsheviks. To my eyes at least, Putin looks to be much closer to the social chauvinist school, and someone like Georgi Plekhanov than Lenin.  The Soviet Union accommodated plenty of Russian nationalists lets not forget. Indeed, his conduct is more befitting of a quasi Tsar than a party secretary. It's perhaps no surprise that Trump gravitates to him?  Now you might say so what, is this meant to reassure us? Well the answer is probably no, it isn't particularly reassuring. Putin is a deep nationalist and that can be a short step away from fascism under certain circumstances.    So what of Trump? Well similarly we've heard him called all sorts of things with popular charaterisations invoking Hitler, Mussolini, and occasionally Franco. Personally I think there's traces of vanity we might associate with Robespierre in there, and with Nikki Halley running around the UN threatening to make lists, there is bit of me that sees paralells with the reign of terror!  I think the danger with trying to attach a label to Trump though is that people seem to believe there's an identikit checklist that can only make you a fully paid up fascist once you've ticked all the boxes off. Trump can't be a fascist because he hasn't introduced a youth indoctrination programme, or he hasn't organised a book burning ceremony in time square, or a torch light precession down central avenue etc There reaches a point however where perhaps people need to accept that you don't have to conform to every historical precedent before you might be considered to be a traveller, there is a grey area in between  At the moment my inclination is to regard both Putin and Trump as being very similar in world outlook. I think that through a certain prism Trump can easily be considered a revolutionary, albeit not one in the Soviet mould clearly. If you prefer to dismiss the revolutionary angle however, it is perhaps worth dwelling on his inaugruation speech. He basically stood there and condemned the Washington establishment and promised to hand power to the people. This is pretty heavy duty rhetoric. Just pick on any rabble rouser from history and put Trump's words into their mouths and see how you begin to react to the actual content?   In a certain light, there are echoes from the past. Although its a concept from about 100 years ago, social chauvinism probably captures them both.   The real danger probably comes from the moment Trump is able to convert this into widespread popular support amongst Americans. History suggests its possible. Remember the first people to oppose Hitler were Germans, and the first people to oppose Mussolini were Italian partisans  Before November anti-Trump Americans were incredibly confident that Hillary would win. They were wrong. In the immedaite aftermath they were reasonably confident that the safety valves in their legislative systems would kerb him and he'd struggle to enact anything. It might be too early to say, but right now I'm not seeing a great deal of evidence this will prove correct either. So when I'm assured that America will never march to the tune of an autocrat ...   If American opposition can bog him down in domestic issues, then perhaps the world can breath again. If not, then who knows what's possible? There's some pretty scary people around Trump, Putin is actually one I'd be less concerned about I think a clinical narcissist would believe their own lies rather than look in the mirror and see someone inferior to the self image they are desperately clinging to. Which sounds about right IMHO, especially the way he doubles down when caught out instead of owning it. If they really wanted a stable world they would have NOT DONE ANYTHING AT ALL. Its funny you should  specifically mention the Mongols in a discussion about occupation/counter insurgency. While they certainly were brutal to anyone who directly opposed them, what with the whole ""kill everyone, burn the houses and sow the fields with salt"" tactic and all, they actually practiced a much more lenient administrative style with states that saw sense and capitulated.  Mongolian vassals generally retained most of their previous culture and autonomy outside of the regular taxes (men and supplies mostly) they were required to pay to the Mongolian empire itself, in fact many states actually felt serious economic benefits from access to new trade partners and safer trade routes. Much like with internet piracy, it seems the most effective counter insurgency tactic is simply to make life appreciably better for those under your control - or at least, it was back then. The third option isn't really an option against ISIS type groups at the moment though. ISIS isn't interested in coexisting, and they're the controlling government in their areas, so they control the information, education and culture. The longer we wait the more indoctrinated the locals and new generations get. It can end up as another Palestine type perpetually festering situation, if you wait long enough. A decisive military push can end that. After you have someone else in control you can start to make the long term gains needed to achieve a permanent political solution.  I think you're also underestimating the military effectiveness against terrorist threats. It's not a new threat, so we have a lot of information and practical experience in fighting it. It is definitely a different type of a fight compared to standard armies facing off, but we know what we need to do to counter it. The problem is you need to massively outnumber the terrorists, have effective control of the area, good intel and support of the locals to succeed. It is more of a policing operation at this point. So while military isn't the best suited for it, it is still necessary to create the preconditions that are needed for those other options become viable. The military push doesn't need to be made by the US though and co-operation of a local security force is pretty much mandatory. > Thank you for your service.   Come on, man.  This shit just makes us look ridiculous. No, Russia has no interest in being under America's thumb. They want to be an ally. Look at the carnage he's caused in just 8 days.  I wouldn't put anything past him at this point.  Reread why the war started, we became enemies with China and closer ties with Russia. There are a lot of ""too coincidental"" happenings. It will just be that we are missing the public proof. I indeed hope someone has a conscious and gets it to the media. No, the German question is will Germany enter the Russian market as a partner. Mexico will henceforth be known as The Land Beyond the Wall. While the Wall of Freedom is not explicitly designed to stop all trade, I expect it to be fairly effective.  1938  US GDP = 84 billion $   USSR GDP = 23 billion $  Yet they where still a big threat to both Germany, Japan, UK and the US.  Also GDP alone is a pretty dumb way at looking at a country, or a country in conflict.  Russia is a very good country when it comes to being self-sufficient, it can produce and export it's own oil, natural gas, coal, metals, timber, wheat, corn, dairy products, livestock/meat.  It's biggest import is cars, tech, fruit and medicine. All of them which could fairly easily be switched from western cars, tech, medicine to eastern cars, tech and medicine.  Russia is one of the most self-sufficient countries in the world, and will be 100% self-sufficient in the near future. GDP is a good number to take in account when you copare countries. That and 30-40 other numbers and idexes. Like...   Poverty levels (Russian is ~15% to Mecxican ~45%). Level of medicine, education, military might, industrial potential, power projection, industry, science potential, debt, inflation, GINI, HDI... and like dozens and dozens of other things. People write freaking doctors dissertations on this shit, spending 3-4 years in analysis.  Comparing 2 countries by GDP alone is like comparing to people on the amount of cash they spend each week. Is John good at math and can he tie his shoes? IDK but he has 5000$! Last time i checked Mexico wasn't in the UN security council,  last time i checked Mexico wasn't the hegemon over their part of the world,  last time i checked Mexico didn't have the capacity to blow the whole world to kingdom come.  Last time i checked Mexico didn't have claims in the north sea, north pole and antartica... which might very well be the future of energy.  Last time i checked we didn't hitch-hike to space with the help of the Mexicans.   Calling Russia irrelevant and a ""gas station"" is fucking idiotic Not only that but he's also pushing China and Germany + the rest of the EU away.  Now that i think about it, mexico didn't even sanction Russsia. What kind of ally is that. Actually 2nd is Canada and 3rd is China.  No clue where Mexico stands but it is definitely 4 or 5th So there is some great unexplored potential for trade between USA and Russia. Russian economy has been growing rapidly for the last 15 years.  > an ally with a similar GDP to Russia  Also closer and easier to trade with...cost of trade with a neighboring nation will always be leaps and bounds more affordable than transporting goods halfway around the world. Exactly. They are in decline and no longer a threat. This is why Hillary Clinton's aggressive posturing made no sense.  Trump made the right call in identifying China as the largest upcoming threat to American interests.   Russia borders China. Good relations with them would help America check on China's rampant expansion and militarization of the South China sea. Russia's economy stopped declining. They stabilized after sanctions. Sanctions actually hurt other European countries more as Russia refuses to import goods now due to having to develop ways to make them themselves.   GDP will soon rise as wages are getting back to what they used be (As far as largest cities went it wasn't lowered anyway).  Calling it ""Gas station"" when it is also one of the largest weapon exporters is also unfair. Not to mention they also make and sell plutonium for nukes which is something USA is not capable off.   On top of that they beginning to cultivite their own bananas oranges and fruit they have to import and are slowly moving towards self sufficient economy.  Not to mention many countries kept working with Russia despite sanctions or they'd crash.  Don't juat blindly trust Western media please.  They are a nuclear superpower with extreme leverage on all our NATO allies being basically the gas station of Europe with their control of pipelines. To act like it all boils down to simply GDP numbers is just ridiculous. Treating others as our equals is called diplomacy, and how the left screams we should treat everyone. I guess everyone except Russia? Please. A positive relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MexicoRussia_relations#cite_note-trade-6  Russia and Mexico do a good bit of trade No, it's going straight into Nietos or GNJ pockets.  Because Mexico is an ally, whereas Russia is not  I mean, sanctions hurt them on the margins sure, but the real thing that fucked over russia was falling gas prices >ut yes, their GDP shrank by massive amounts.  It did, but much of the fluctuation comes from the drop in the ruble It's more about it being nominated in USD. When the FX rate plummets, the number plummets.   The biggest part of Russian GDP is internal trade, which is not influenced by FX rate. International trade is something like 35-40% of the Russian GDP.  Real GDP fell by ~5-6%, not by half. Still bad, but not as catastrophic. Nukes don't help you during trade/sanctions negotiations though.   The only thing they are good for is to prevent people from invading your country, which nobody does anymore anyway, besides Russia itself.  Either way, Americans don't benefit. What he meant probably for each bridge destroyed in Iraq, build  bridge at home ;) It's cute how he's trying so hard to find a gotcha there lol.  Then next time pick Montanas GDP instead of the state with the highest GDP.  Its obvious what you were trying to do.  But.. but Clinton has ties to the saudis!!!!  If you could still find a way up, then you haven't really hit rock bottom.  It has too Denbts?  ""NO VLAD, THIS ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE!!! I SWEAR... IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME THAT TAPE BACK, I'M GONNA... GONNA TELL EVERYONE BOUT THAT TIME YOU SUCKED A DICK. DON'T PUSH ME, MAN. THIS ISN'T A GAME"".  Not without the nuclear triad to deliver those nukes they aren't. That's just not the case. Pakistan has modern nukes, and are they a threat to us? Is India? Even China, if they were able to drop all 250 of their nukes on American soil would still have failed to knock us out. Only Russia, which posseses 45,000 nukes truly threatens to annihilate us and the rest of the world.  I'm not trying to underplay the threat of a Chinese nuclear attack. If they hit Los Angeles that would be a disaster. But the simple fact is that even China the country with the third largest nuclear arsenal cannot threaten annihilation, especially given our missile defense system. Whereas Russia could annihilate us and then some. Well, MAD is supposed to keep both sides from stepping. It's generally decreased world violence. The era of Nuclear Weapons has been more peaceful than pretty much every other era of humanity. Have you heard of the Samson option?     MAD won't sound as petty.  Why does it have to be a zero sum game? China and US can both co-exist in mutual benefit. Stop buying into this war like narrative. Even China doesn't want US to destabilise. Except for surrounding them, China actually would love the US to keep policing the world. > Russia is a washed up power  Keep telling yourself that.  Putin would be insulted and Kim Jong Un would be honored by your comment. It's part of Trump's vision to start some kind of impotent alliance to counter the EU. > servile  Oh for fucks sake will you people be happy with anything less than another cold war? 5000 nukes can make everyone capitulate maybe? Not to mention that this"" mutually beneficial"" relationship is going to involve a lot of bullying as well.   Trump already instated bans on refugees. Russia recently decriminalized domestic violence. The only ones who suffer here are the victims.  It amazes me how easily it seems everyone has forgotten that point. Imho this is far far more significant than the email intervention that's being accused of prove it. until i see evidence i cant believe anything.  Yeah that one. The one that rigs elections, executes journalists, and imprisons punk bands. We need to be good buddies at all costs. None of those countries can be neutralized in a first strike...they all have ballistic missile submarines.  In China's case, they also have a vast network of underground bunkers all over the country that are meant to hide and protect their mobile launchers. > or could be safely neutralized through a first strike (China, France, Israel, etc)  So why are you listing countries that can't? > It is also the only country to have anything close to nuclear parity with the US (in terms of the number and yield of warheads and in terms of the sophistication of delivery systems).  ""Anything close to nuclear parity""  Except they're leagues ahead. It's amazing how people would even dispute this, considering the fact that the United States hasn't even developed that many ICBMs, while Russia has developed quite an insane amount of them. Hell, their current ICBM's weight is around 200 tons. It should read ""especially so many"" but I'm on a tablet device and it sucks balls for being able to write. So the UK is a wild card? Cool. I didn't mean as a bargaining tool but in relation to actual military power. The idea is that they aren't equals, but they want to work together *as equals*. I don't know why people are having such trouble with this. Good relations don't just spring up out of nowhere. Something has to be given. If what Putin wants is bad for US interests as a whole then it's not a good idea.  You have missed [any context](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2014-08-18/why-ukraine-crisis-west-s-fault) [ever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_authoritarian_regimes_supported_by_the_United_States). So that's why rappers from Detroit are in full-on bling mode, it all makes sense now. A little tooooooooo ironic, I really do think. Tetris  jk   We hadn't invented the narrative of Russian puppet yet, remember? I mean I know we've always been at war with Eastasia but that was around November when that first started being said. I guess that math checks out. I was being a tad more optimistic though. I mean, you guys did survive Dubya as well. So what's your diagnosis? Syria would have become another lybia, iraq. right? So, back to our original question: 'Will US/RUS cooperation open new strategic options that can end to the global terrorist threat through military intervention?' (Paraphrasing)  I concede that our combined militaries are fully capable (individually or jointly) in wrecking whatever government functions and military assets and manpower IS has built. Granted. And I concede that lacking government or military, it will be impractical for IS to hold land as a proto-country, as it does now. But that's not terrorism, that's a rogue state. We're both proficient at destroying states.   But the IS state isn't synonymous with the terrorist threat, which pre-existed IS and will survive (and perhaps even flourish) after their downfall.  That's the point of the current administrations' fight against the media - keep saying they spout nothing but lies, so when the truth shows up, it's disregarded and ignored. Rednecks will take the black to guard the wall Is Cuba asshai? Does the wall make the ""real"" Americans the White Walkers? ""Wall of Freedom"" is so Orwellian. Nobody's saying they're not a threat, we're saying the cost of doing business with them (rewarding bad behavior and upsetting our allies) isn't worth it considering the meager size of their economy.  Whatever we gain in trade with Russia we will lose in trade with other nations. And in the process Russia gets richer and has even more money to meddle in Western democracies.  I really can't believe we're even having this argument a few weeks after Trump publicly admitted Russia interfered in our elections.  The thing is allies with high military potential are useful when you're up against a major military rival and completely useless otherwise. This is why Russia is such a crap ally for a country without true military rivals in an age without great power war. Allies with high economic potential are useful in all situations. Given that Russia and the EU look to be at odds over many issues in the future it is stupid to choose Russia over them. Having raw materials like oil and timber doesn't make you self-sufficient in 2017.  Russia has very little high-tech industry like electronics compared to e.g. Europe or the US.  They very much rely on trade to get by.   You know who doesn't? North Korea. And look at what a shithole that is. And it's not because of their lack of timber or natural gas.  You forgot about diamonds. Russia produces a lot of diamonds. Bringing up the year 1938 is like you threatening me and me saying stop it or I will call my grand grandfather who was a kick-ass boxer in 1938. They weren't a threat, more like a target; Japan and Germany both attacked the Soviet Union because Russia was considered vulnerable -it lost the Russo-Japanese war, surrendered to the Germans via the Treaty of Brest-Litvosk, and the communists were no less repressive as the Tsars had been- by most of the world. The stereotype of the Russians were that if a radio broke, they'd shoot the radio as punishment. Hitler described the Soviet Union as a rotting house, with one good shove being all that was necessary to make the whole thing collapse; that wasn't an uncommon view.  The Soviets were pushed to the gates of Moscow by the Nazis and then spent the next four years taking back their country piece by piece with American assistance. By comparison, the United States not only produced more war material than every other combatant nation, it had enough resources to simultaneously pursue a nuclear weapons program; and it had 4 years of beingthe sole country with nuclear weapons. The lesson is that GDP does matter..  As for modern Russia, it suffers from the same problem that has always plagued Russia; its people's amazing potentisl are held down by the government's paranoia and intense desire to control everything. One particular example is the case of Oleg Losev, a man who could have been the Soviet Union's equivalent of Thomas Edison; he was developing solid state devices more than 30 years before the United States started to fund research into solid state devices- Losev's lack of a degree meant that his career never progressed beyond that of a lab assistant. Losev invented LEDs, a ubiquitous technology today and the Soviet Union's government failed to utilize his talents. When you consider that the Soviets also destroyed their own crops by letting a fool like Trofirm Lysenko apply pseudoscience to the Soviet Union's wheat, the culpability of the Kremlin in ruining Russia is undeniable.   Until Russia has a government that doesn't punish or neglect the best minds in the country, no amount of talent or potential is going to change things for the better.  Haha. Ya. ""Self-sufficient"" the same way N. Korea is self-sufficient. Cars that are absolute s***, clothes and shoes that are drab and of the lowest quality, durable goods that aren't durable, and a black market that's equal or larger than the actual market. Don't forget to add bribes and price controls. The only thing that Russia is self-sufficient in is vodka.  (ok, and radioactive potatoes).  No one is saying that Mexico is a world power or that they're more developed than Russia (they aren't). We're talking about treating Russia as equals *compared to the US* when they clearly are not.   The OP bought Mexico up so I just pointed out how they are far more important to us from an economic perspective than Russia is. We don't even get our oil from the Russians. Another one.   Average yearly salary in Meixco is $12,850 per year   Average yearly salary in Russia is $7,368 per year.   The monthly income in January averaged only 21365 rubles (about USD $291). Don't trust random redditors.   Compared to 2014, Russia hasn't recovered. The sanctions & Saudi's driving down the oil market did that.  That's why Russian oil magnates desperately want American fracking & deep water drilling technology for their 'legitimately' acquired Ukrainian reserves. If Russia uses that ""leverage"" it will completely demolish their economy while being slightly bothering for us. By allying yourself with them and agreeing on their goal to destroy our union, we will seek better relations with China among others.   You might only focus on those Europeans critical of your various government's policies, but fact is that Europe always have had some of the most favorable views of the US in the world. Right now you're throwing everything away in the name of ""real-politik"" because you only see enemies or those who can be subjugated ...well, except when it comes to those with the same sick worldview. As far as I'm aware, neither is China or Saudi Arabia. There are probably a few countries that have the same interest as us. Mexico is probably one of them. So I agree, but I don't think trading with Russia is bad if we do it with China and Saudi Arabia.   And the USA...   Nukes prevent the destabilization of your country from external forces because nobody wants to risk nukes falling into rogue hands. Pakistan received a lot of US money.  The only thing they are good for is to prevent people from invading your country, which nobody does anymore anyway, besides Russia itself.  wow just wow But, you have to hire someone to make a replacement million dollar bomb Why Montana? The point is California'a GDP  is higher than Russia's. And in fact Texas' GDP is also higher.  She's gonna start WWIII! And don't forget about her emails! Her emails for fuck sake! We chose well, right guys? Right? And emails!!!?! [Explanation.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2zu0za/what_is_pay_denbts_and_why_do_i_see_it_appearing/) Vlad is short for Vladislav. Don't make me laugh, Troomp. In Soviet Russia, dick sucks you. 4chan trolled so many idiots  But trump likely isn't factoring that in and this is most likely just him being pro russia as he has been for the past several years.  http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2015/12/17/what-is-nuclear-triad-debate-sot.cnn A modern nuclear exchange of ""only"" 250 nukes per side would have catastrophic climate consequences. Several degrees C and massive insolation loss, crop famine, etc.    This comment made my stomach tie up in a knot Basically, if Pakistan and India get into a nuclear war, it would be sufficient to severely affect global climate, and would be a threat to the entire world, so yes, any country with modern nukes would be a threat to the US, as well as to the rest of the world.  They don't even need to drop it on US soil.  Don't believe me, go look at the data.  It's sort of hilarious that the conservatives view one of our largest allies (and a group that's basically a neo-imperial colony) as enemies.  What do they think nato is?  oh right..... something that's bad...... You couldn't be much more impotent than the EU right now, in more ways than one both literally and figuratively. No, we won't rest until American tanks roll through Moscow and we force Putin to dance to When the Eagle Cries!   :rollseyes. Did you look into the details of the decriminalization of domestic violence or did you just read the headline?   ""Russia's parliament voted 380-3 on Friday to decriminalize domestic violence in cases where it does not cause ""substantial bodily harm"" and does not occur more than once a year.  The move, which eliminates criminal liability in such cases, makes a violation punishable by a fine of roughly $500, or a 15-day arrest, provided there is no repeat within 12 months.""  ""Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told journalists that family conflicts do ""not necessarily constitute domestic violence.""  ""The passage by the parliament, or Duma, reverses a ruling by the Supreme Court last year, subsequently backed by parliament, that decriminalized battery that does not inflict bodily harm, but retained criminal charges involving battery against family members. That reform is effectively reversed by Friday's vote.""  http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/01/27/russian-parliament-decrimiinalizes-domestic-violence/97129912/  FFS they are still punishing domestic violence. I've been saying for years that the conservatives view Russia as an ideal country to model ours on.  Socially, economically, and politically, the conservatives are trying to make the US more like russia.  Just look at the policies they're enacting. What a meaningless message. The only ones who suffer are the *victims*?  Are we speaking of Iran? No, of course not!  The one that doesn't even have elections, executes everyone it doesn't like, bans women driving and imprisons rape victims. With them you're best buddies at all costs.  As long as your country treats Saudi fucking Arabia as an equal and is playing BFF with them, you have no higher moral ground here. US got Justice league. Ironman, Hulk, Thor.... > In the article I linked, the first line puts U.S. imports from Russia at 331.5 billion   No it doesn't. It says **Exports from Russia amounted to US$331.5 billion in 2015**  Meaning TOTAL exports are $331 Billion, in US dollars. The person who wrote this made it redundant by adding the dollar symbol.  Unfortunate for them that companies like Google are now filtering out the white house lies and propaganda. I heard the are chupacabra past the wall and the only way to kill them is with the constitution. Unfortunately the way to make it was lost years ago.  This is a very racist statement and I don't understand why reddit promotes this behavior. Plenty of ""rednecks"" are democrats and have fought hard for minorities.  Comparing the size of each countries economies is a little disingenuous. Russia still controls a large military and directs a hugely disproportionate balance of power in Eurasia compared to other countries. >Trump publicly admitted Russia interfered in our elections.    Source? (Not saying he didn't, just hadn't heard anything about it) Seriously this talk of a better Russia through Trump is a fantasy for them. I have no idea why they expected this, they should just jump to the last phase and release all of the kompromat. Trump is going to be put in check by everyone else in the country and we won't accept new trade agreements that overrule sanctions.     >I really can't believe we're even having this argument a few weeks after Trump publicly admitted Russia interfered in our elections.    I can't believe everyone else doesn't see my way too /s. :/ But people are talking as if Italy or Mexico could do better than Russia in a conflict or as a great power on the world stage, based on their GDP alone it seems. Good thing i never said Russia IS self-sufficient... But they are alot closer than most other nations, including the US.  Also why are you just taking out two ressources i mentioned? I didn't say that having oil and timber alone made them self-sufficient.  Having raw materials like oil, coal, metals, natural gas, timber, wheat, livestock does make you more self-sufficient though, even in 2017.  Not only that, but Russia exports almost double of what it imports.  One of the few things that could prove a big obsticle would be the high-tech industry as you said, i agree and i did say so in my original comment aswell. But they have the necessary base ressources to develop their own, and they could easily acquire people with knowledge to develop their own. They are after all, still running their own space program. I picked that year because it was close to a big conflict which involved both the US and Russia/USSR.  I wanted to compare the GDP of them, while being in or close to a conflict.  What was i supposed to do, compare them in 2017? Pretty sure all the comments above already did that. As i told you, they import/Buy cars from the west. So i don't see why you're bringing up cars lol?  Actually just reading your comment, it's clear you have no idea what you're even talking about. What does drab clothes have to do with being self-sufficient? How many nukes does Mexico have again? And what is the purchase power of said currency in said country? Also what is the median salary? Remittances? What is the adjusted disposable income? What are the benefits and tax returns?  Once again, as I stated, comparing just 2 numbers nets nothing when you compare to countries. This is why economists exist. If it were easy - wed have a lot more of them. I was at least in that Russia and live relatively close to it, while having access to unbiased media as far as the USA vs Russia conflict goes, as well as information obtained through some other sources I would be wise not to mention. Ok, let's say nukes prevent the country holding the nukes being invaded.  Having a ""we don't get invaded"" guarantee still doesn't make you a world power.  To use your example, is Pakistan considered a world power, at same level that e.g. Russia *claims* to be? Broken window fallacy.  If you throw a rock at a window, you have to hire a window fixer.  Do you think breaking windows will lead to economic growth? After the top 3 states the GDP of American states goes down significantly. Texas is number 2. Maryland or Washington would be closer to the average. I don't know why I picked Montana, it was random but after looking it up its way below average.  Damn is there not a single thread here at the moment that doesn't have some sarcastic remark about 'But her emails!?' Gets annoying after a while. CIA World Factbook puts Russia practically on equal grounds in terms of their military to US (not projection power) , when excluding their larger nuclear stockpiles too. As of 2015 Russia has been producing more warplanes than even the US.        It's all available on CIA.gov and the data is open source. Massive amount of it.  >(and a group that's basically a neo-imperial colony)  Are we not talking about Europe anymore?  That remark makes no sense.    But they're brownnnnnnnnn Yeah, we only just now stopped jailing people for a simple wife-slapping... I mean if you think about that - slapping wife would be criminal offence a month ago. Right now, slap will only cost you 500$ fine and 15 days jail time. Most likely it will also cost you a career if you have one.   And the world gone nuts... Jesus...  Iran has punk bands?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ICBMs  Yeah, my mistake, I deleted it. I was skimming and the US part just sort of autocorrected in my mind as I skimmed.  That only means Trump will support Bing.  Ew, Bing. Chupacabras are no more real than a grumkin. It is those Mexican dire wolves we really need to beware of. I hear the former household of the Watch Commander, Juan Snow, had given his children Mexican dire wolf pups as a gift. Can you believe that? Look at those [vicious beasts](http://earthjustice.org/sites/default/files/feature/2016/howling-pup-sevilleta_usfws-800.jpg)! He gave these to his children!  I say we have King Donald, first of his name, King of the Whites and the ~~Native Americans~~ Injuns, ~~Fool~~ Lord of the 50 Kingdoms, ~~Destroyer~~ Protector of the ~~Republic~~ Trump States, destroy the house of that traitor and all his kin. ~~PleaseSendHelp~~ Praise his name! Literally his Transition team statement [http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-cyber-idUSKBN14S0O6](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-cyber-idUSKBN14S0O6) > Source? (Not saying he didn't, just hadn't heard anything about it)  That's ok, plenty of Trumps supporters are still saying it didn't happen, even after denying it became so implausible that even Trump stopped doing it.  The most basic requirements for developing high-tech industry are:  - A well-educated population  - Not having ""brain drain""  Russia fails on both.  And they can't acquire people to set it up for them, considering what the country is like.  What would help, though, is international investment in such a sector in Russia, which Putin killed by being an unreliable, corrupt shit with similar overall government, and then by placing the cold-war-esque desire to grab neighbouring territory over the need for a stable country and economy.  So no, Russia will not be getting high-tech anytime soon, and without high-tech, you're not self-sufficient in 2017.  Think of it this way: how many countries can supply your country with alternative sources of oil, food, lumber, etc? Most third world countries could help you out there. Now figure how many sources there are for essential electronics. That's a much shorter list.  For example, processors for desktop computers or servers. How many countries can make those? One. And that one country is not Russia. That one country is the US.  Sounds like you're too much into what you read from books and not enough about real world applications when it comes to economics. Keep reading and, remember, never question what you read. You remember the Cuban Missile Crisis?   Having good and close relations with neighbors is a good idea from a national defense standpoint as it can prevent a shit show like that from repeating itself. Never said it did. Your reading comprehension is lacking.  The point is that some US states produce more than Russia.  Considering that was the only complaint ever pinned on Clinton the entire election, and apparently emails are worse than making fun of disabled people, expanding the use of torture in direct violation of international law, banning muslims, increasing our deficit back to george dubya levels while claiming that he will pay off the debt in 8 years, expanding ""alternative facts"" and fake news in general...  Fucking deal with it being annoying. It should be posted everywhere to remind republicans how fucking stupid they were voting for donald Yeah, it got real annoying for us too during the election.  They're sarcastic?  I really thought the Trumpets were *still* deflecting by talking about Hillary, even after the election. They're sarcastic?  I really thought the Trumpets were *still* deflecting by talking about Hillary, even after the election. I am on the Russian military section of the CIA World Factbook, and I can't find this information that equates Russia military Strength to US military.  Can you point it out for me, I can only seem to find one table that says the % of GPD they spend on their military Alright these aren't apples to apples comparisons. Even if Russia had twice as many planes they would be unable to wield them. Do you have any idea how much it costs to keep a fighter armed and in the air continuously. They don't have the cash to support that, without including the huge amount old neglected Soviet crap without parts and spares they count in this list.  It all comes down to money, and they don't have it now.   Lest you think I am pulling a bait on switch, I acknowledge that Russians are formidable foe in Russia, but so are the Chinese, Indians and the Vietnamese.   But this discussion started off as a discussion about how Russia is a military equal, it's not , not even close.  And compared to the USSR, they are very much a washed up power. Mexico is the colony, I believe. Since when is EU brown?  The EU has a higher caucasion to non-caucasian ratio than the US. If anything the US should be considered brown compared to the EU. There are people out there who read, I promise. It's just nobody wants to get past the headline  When I see an abrasive headline I think ""what's the truth buried in it?"" not like some who say ""see!? see!? This shows I'm right!""  Its just critical thinking and humans have given it up for their software to do it for them. Now, they are easily misled. A simple headline fires confirmation bias in their heads and tells them that they are thinking correctly  Actually yes, here's a pretty tragic story of such a band that you should read.  http://articles.latimes.com/2013/nov/11/nation/la-na-iranian-band-20131112  A lot of Iranian youth are actually surprisingly fond of American culture, I'm personally not a fan of how Iran has been given the cold shoulder by the U.S. The joke... [you missed it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_League). Luckily, nobody will ever say ""Let me bing that for you"". And as to Canada, The North remembers! (But is too polite to say anything). That's not what he said. Hacking the DNC is not ""hacking the elections"".  Well, when the intelligence agencies change their story from ""Russia hacked the election"" to ""Russia influenced the election with fake news"" it's hard to know what to deny when the story is constantly changing.  If anything, the intelligence agencies backed off and were forced to stop claiming Russia gave Wikileaks its info. I would say that is a bit of a disingenuous comparison. First of all, Cuba was a proxy of the Comintern during the height of the Cold War. Mexico is not a proxy nor are we in a cold war (although if Clinton were elected it may have come to that). Secondly, we attacked Cuba first with the Bay of Pigs incident. Having nukes, for them, was a way to guarantee sovereignty and freedom from further meddling from the US. We didn't attack Mexico, we simply want to cut down on the amount of illegal immigration. Also, Russia has much more influence in regards to world politics and events. With a US and Russian mutual understanding, both countries can grow in prosperity and peace and pursue mutual goals such as stamping out ISIS.  > Nukes prevent the destabilization of your country from external forces  Ok, I picked a specific subset of that, while you picked a broader concept. The principle still applies.  Being a world power isn't defined as ""a country that is not easily destabilized"" I think the point has been made though. The majority of threads here about Trump say 'But her emails!?' in some capacity and not only does it detract from the issues at hand, it's also no longer relevant. Hold on a minute, the sarcasm has gotten real annoying? If this is annoying, can you begin to comprehend how annoying it was when it wasn't sarcasm? Imagine how annoying it was when her emails were somehow a good enough argument to counter mental instability, ignorance, trolling, gas lighting, and basically every red flag that predicted this nightmare? And that's without getting into all the isms. Seriously, you have to understand how I find your annoyance at sarcasm to be the silliest complaint, so excuse me if I laugh in your face. Fuck your annoyance, our annoyance is this nightmare of an imbecile you all elected for office and his fucking four horseman of a cabinet he's made for himself, with one of his members openly saying he wants to destroy the America as we know it. Yeah, I'm still shocked in amazement at how you all managed to convince millions that emails were worse than this.   Edit: A word Because they are. And deflect by talking about Obama, and someone even complained that Clinton defended a rapist pedophile.  [Here's a Snopes article explaining this shit.](http://www.snopes.com/hillary-clinton-freed-child-rapist-laughed-about-it/) You are still in 90's rhetoric. Russia has been modernising its military for the past decade now. Faster than ever in the last 5 years. The last time Russia has been rearming this fast was during the Soviet era. Syria was their first actual theatre of war since the collapse of the SU that caught everyone off guard. They tested missiles and ships that no one knew they even had.       Syria was a huge success for Russia and the recent annexation of the largest country in Europe does not point to Russia being in any trouble militarily. Quite the contrary. They've exceeded all expectations.  Ah, my bad, I thought he was talking about the EU, since the previous commenter talked about countering the EU.  Talking about Mexico with the neo-colony part People just need a bubble gum for their brains to chew on it and feel ""well-informed"". We have saying in Russia that roughly translates: ""You hear the ringing, but you don't know where it comes from"". It is being used when people say something they overheard and have no idea about context. Such a shame...  George w bush needed more names for his axis of evil I guess Oh youre right. lol.  No one said ""hacking the elections,"" so I'm not sure why you're putting quotes around it. Not really. Pakistan is a great example of my point being valid and yours being unrelated at all.  Not really sure where you're going with any of this as you're making comments on an issue you are creating yourself. I think you're lost on this one. As in unknown where to go, not the opposite of win.  > someone even complained that Clinton defended a rapist pedophile.  AKA literally doing the job she was supposed to do as a defense attorney. That's literally the title of the article he linked. OP used the term ""interfered with the election"" and that's wrong as well.  Some guy who recently brought up this story to me as an argument against Clinton tried to argue that ""public attorney should protect the public and refuse to defend someone like that!"".

Wow US murder in Yemen is now in the news, after years of media ignoring it. Wonder why. mad dog mattis baby What the hell is the US doing, bombing in Yemen? The stupid fucks in charge will never learn... It also killed terrorist leaders. It's no where near as bad as the drone campaign, but there will always be collateral damage in war. Is it possible the civilians were being used as human shields? Never mind the money the money the UK is making on the war...look---> shiny!  Thats 3 times as many people that were killed in canada. And by the us to. This is going to be a shitstorm >A provincial official, who did not want to be named, and unnamed tribal sources, told the AFP news agency that eight women and eight children were killed in the dawn raid on Yakla district in the central province of Bayda. Sources told the EFE news agency that six women and three children were killed in the attack.  I bet the girls were also all four years old and the women were all 20 year something freshly married wives.  So who do these civilians blame more?  The US for the airstrike or the militants who are reason for the airstrike  Can't wait for Isis member interview after US raid.   Thanks, ~~Obama~~ Trump. Trump didn't even wait a week before he invades a country and massacres civilians. Quite impressive. We also used the rebels or their proxies as sources on civilians deaths in Aleppo during Assad and Russian bombings. ""A provincial official, who did not want to be named, and unnamed tribal sources, told the AFP news agency thateight women and eight children were killed in the dawn raid on Yakla district in the central province of Bayda.

Only pics I could find about this attack (nsfw/sensible) from an charity organisation. 1 of the killed children is from an American dad, if what they say is true.

Donald Trump is bad man!!! The war in Yemen is being carried out by our ally Saudi Arabia. Syria on the other hand has Russia/ Assad as a ""bad guy"" to object to. There is also the minor detail that the US is flying bombing raids daily in Syria whereas Yemen gets occasional drone strikes.  Both get reported on in the press, but it's very noticeable that the military briefings are heavy on details for Syria but try to avoid Yemen. They have been reporting on it all the time.  Brown people don't matter.  Havn't you got the memo? Can't wait for the anti-war protests to randomly show up after they have been nowhere to be seen for the last 8 years.  It's not like Obama didn't put us into more Middle East conflicts.../s Yeah, it's almost like the American media is more concerned with things which directly impact Americans than foreigners. Most Americans can't point to Yemen on a map, let alone that the US is supporting a Saudi intervention in the country. It's going to be amazing that all of sudden people care now that it is a Republican Admin that is performing the action.  That's because the media dare not criticize anything when it happens under Obama's command. The source was an Al Quaeda member, and you believe these statistics? Remeber that the US military classifies any male over 12 as a militant automatically.   So somewhere between 0 and 14 people that normal people would classify as militants Depends on which source you believe... To be fair the Russians have always been filthy inhumane shitheads when it comes to war. Because a us service member died... It'd not an anti trump thing,  he's doing enough shit that complaining about standard anti terror special forces campaigns is very low on the list.  I think it's fair to see we had a little more faith in Obama than Trump. It's not a double-standard. Fighting al Qaeda?  You do know Yemen has had a war raging for years right? Obviously not.  Terrorists probably shouldn't have launched missiles at our ships in international waters from Yemen but hey they did nothing wrong.  > It's no where near as bad as the drone campaign  IDK. A drone might have killed roughly the same amount of people (save for the American soldier), but the USA wouldn't have had the chance to seize documents, computers and anything else. And while it didn't happen this time, it is possible for this type of raid to end up with captured terrorists (or guys in the wrong place at the wrong time) who can later be interrogated. [removed] Yeah. They happened to life in the same village. Clearly a long con by terrorists planned in the 50s /s  Also this doesnt absolve from killing them non the less if they would have been used as human shields.  Finally it just adds to the hypocricsy that the US is killing civillians in countries they deny people to flee from. They don't (can't) blame anyone. They are dead. What matters is that they're dead and most likely the US soldiers who participated are responsible, as is their chain of command all the way to the president.  PS. This was not an air strike. It was a raid. This would be AQ not ISIS. Damnit, Donald.  We've been in a covert war in Yemen since the Arab Spring.  Consider the source is an Al Qaeda member before you get too angry.  Hmm.  >could be true, could be false  Yet you titled the post as though it were fact  True true just pointed it out beacuse it's the only credited source. Enemy hides in and operates among civilians. Sorry... ""civilians"" are going to get killed.  Everything gets reported on somewhere.  Some things are just reported on more vigorously everytime I see a Yemen war topic it's always followed by comments saying ""Why isn't the media reporting on this???!!!"" Really? I havent heard jack shit out of Yemen compared to the reporting done on Syria. They treat it like a damn blip.  >... And that concludes our special on President Trump's strange way of eating cake. ^(Today, 30 killed in poison attack in Yemen) Could your dog's food have the same ingredients as Gumdrops? Find out after the break. 99% of US sources I've seen are using a headline similar to ""1 US serviceman killed in Yemen raid"", instead of mentioning all the deaths. It's been more than 8 years too. Sure he should of just let ISIS spread right?  Just be glad that anti-war protesters don't run the country.   The U.S. would cease to be a superpower and other countries will fill the void. Would a doctor be a good source? Because in the reuters report one says his 8 yo grandchild was killed  Well to be fair the US has been working to turn about half the population in the middle east into anti-US militants for the past few decades. At least, I assume that has been their aim - no one is that bad at making allies..... I believe civilians were killed and the US death toll is higher because some of those soldiers who killed the civilians will come home and commit suicide. But our president Trump, will label them as ""weak"" because they are not sociopaths.   Edit: https://youtu.be/kelmEZe8whI Oh ye and 'Muricans are saints?  Vietnam, Philippines, or even further back meddling into Chinese affairs and attempting to buy out the country while treating them as second grade people So are the US if not worse Of course, that's the standard reason. But when they are done we will have more enemies than before, and it will give them more reasons implement monstrous policies within the US. A pattern that has been repeating a lot of late... Why are we picking sides in Yemen's civil war (Iran and Saudi Arabia's proxy war) would be the more pertinent question. >Yemeni security and tribal officials said the raid in Yemen's central Bayda province killed three senior al-Qaida leaders: Abdul-Raouf al-Dhahab, Sultan al-Dhahab, and Seif al-Nims.  http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-yemen-united-state-raid-20170129-story.html [removed] Both funded by Saudis '16 civilians may have possible been killed according to unnamed people. Other unnamed people say only 9 were killed. I guess we had to be there to know.'   It's not quite as catchy is it. Or maybe you should only carry out raids where you know that over 25% of the dead will NOT be civilians. The US military claims to do their best not to target civilians, but reports like these don't inspire confidence in their ability to do so. Read articles. [Here is one from almost two years ago](http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/23/middleeast/yemen-conflict-explainer-photos/). I remember having my newsfeed be nothing but Yeman civilians being unable to get supplies sent to them (no it was not Aleppo) I see articles on my newsfeed weekly.  Because that is the highlight for the US. This is the first military death under Trump's presidency, and that doesn't change the fact they have been reporting on it since the civil/Saudi war started.  Republicans in our time will never take ownership of the invasion or Iraq, nor will they ever acknowledge the idiocy of the De-Ba'athification order, nor will they be able to accept that these two things created ISIS.  To accept facts would mean they were wrong, and modern Republicans are incapable of that.  It will somehow always by Obama's fault in the eyes of Republicans.   He did, by his terrible pull out plan from Iraq.  Going in was a terrible idea and should have never happened.  But that doesn't take away from how Obama fucked up the pull out and allowed ISIS to gain a stronghold. I'm not ""using"" him for anything. I'm stating the facts. Enjoy denial. Read a proper news source, Reuters said the source was Al Quaeda Sounds like we made a mess we're gonna have to stick around to clean up.  >the US death toll is higher because some of those soldiers who killed the civilians will come home and commit suicide  What?   Wow. It might not even have been the us soldiers that killed the civilians seeing as it's something they would avoid doing.   Trump has done nothing but advocate for better treatment for veterans, with an emphasis on those who come home with psychological proplems.  https://www.donaldjtrump.com/policies/veterans-affairs-reform/?/positions/veterans-administration-reforms  Yea okay. You see, some of the laws do not apply when persecuting AQ. It's open hunting season on them, any place on the globe all the time. Welcome to America! Yes, with boots on the ground. CIA, DIA & SOCOM have been on the ground for years.  It's supposed to be factual, not ""catchy."" You wouldn't ever carry out a raid then, it's not an accident that they like to operate out of areas where there will be civillians.  Of course, I wasn't saying that they aren't reporting on it. I'm just saying that there's probably a strong bias attached. The invasion of Iraq was a bipartisan movement. You comprehend Obama left because Iraq's Prime Minister, Al-Maliki, **refused** to sign a new Status Of Forces Agreement (SOFA)? That without a SOFA, service members would be held to the local national laws and punishments. Without a SOFA, if it was illegal for a woman to be out without a burka, and a female soldier was arrested for it, there would be nothing the US could do for her.  No SOFA, no forces. Obama *begged* Maliki for a new SOFA. Maliki refused, and stated the claims of a dangerous insurgency were made up by Obama to subjugate the Iraqi people.   Keep the bullshit ""alternate facts"" to other subs please, like /r/T_D, or /r/conspiracy, where they're more accepting of those kinds of things... Should we have stayed in Iraq without an adequate status of forces agreement?  Should Obama have not done what Bush ordered?  Remember, Obama was elected almost entirely on his opposition to Iraq and his promise to get us out.    Last but not least, ISIS can be 100% tied to the invasion of Iraq in the first place. After that, it can be tied to a blunder of epic proportions - Bush's de-Ba'athification order.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-Ba'athification   Also, the pull out was actually ordered by Bush.  The Bush Administration sought an agreement with the Iraqi government, and in 2008 George W. Bush signed the U.S.Iraq Status of Forces Agreement. It included a deadline of 31 December 2011, before which ""all the United States Forces shall withdraw from all Iraqi territory"".  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_of_U.S._troops_from_Iraq https://www.democracynow.org/2015/4/24/as_obama_apologizes_for_deaths_of      https://www.rt.com/usa/317932-obama-apologized-kunduz-hospital/  Enjoy the actual facts. Obama apologized and took responsibility for his drone strikes.  We might be reading different reports because it clearly said Dr. Awlaki. Are you saying Reuters is or isn't a proper news source, since that's the when I was using.  Have you seen this?   https://youtu.be/kelmEZe8whI Except in Syria when the AQ groups are intertwined with ""rebels"". More like none of the laws apply... women, children, all fair game... [Al Qaeda are definitely involved in Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda_insurgency_in_Yemen) i refuse to believe that most Americans are scum.. just some. Nah man they are so high speed their boots never touch the ground.  You don't get that sweet karma with factual headlines I am fine with that. That's a lie in so far as the President was a Republican who had his administration cherry pick intelligence to convince Congress to approve it.  It's also a lie because invasions aren't directed or ordered by Congress.  The President is the Commander in Chief.  It was led by a Republican.  All Republicans own it.  All Republicans own ISIS. Bullshit.  The day Iraqi officials try to charge an American Soldier is the same day pigs will fly.  Another bullshit deflection from 8 years of horrendous foreign policy.  And the Donald?  Really? Like I said, Bush should have ever went in.  That was a mistake.  Obama could have handled the pull out much better and did not have to comply with a former administrations orders. The point is, the media didn't obsess over them the way they are obsessing over the people from those very same countries that were inconvenienced in airports this weekend. There's a double standard.  >[**WikiLeaks' Collateral Murder:  U.S. Soldier Ethan McCord [17:22]**](http://youtu.be/kelmEZe8whI)  > [*^mediasanctuary*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5JTfy24J7STy5lwDeNHq6g) ^in ^News ^& ^Politics  >*^2,462,431 ^views ^since ^Aug ^2010*  [^bot ^info](/r/youtubefactsbot/wiki/index) Funny.

End of story.  We did not want to lose any more American lives over there.

True, not a proxy group - they're independent of states. > WITHOUT A SOFA, THEY *CAN* CHARGE SOLDIERS. THAT'S WHY WE DON'T GO PLACES WITHOUT SOFAS.

It's quite simply honestly, I'm not sure what's giving you problems honestly Which we are not doing at all? We're conducting surgical strikes with the Iraq government? > Because we controlled their government until then. Tell me, when did the post-Saddam government ran by Iraqis themselves begin?

It's quite simply honestly, I'm not sure what's giving you problems honestly Again, even without a SOFA, U.S. forces would never have been charged or prosecuted by local Iraq officials.  That's another deflection from a shitty pull out. And I would agree with the strikes.  But too little too late.  Trust me, this is coming from an isolationist that only believes in small scale Spec Op missions.  But we fucked up going into Iraq and by doing so we should have committed ourselves after the fact.  Not suggesting troops on the ground besides Spec Ops, but we should form a coalition of local countries.  Force Saudi Arabia, UAE and even Iran to deal with the situation.

"50",49,"5qu0b0","2017-01-29","> On the other hand, Trump is an unpredictable actor who in just nine days in office has sewn division across the United States and shocked capitals around the world with a series of executive actions that are overturning decades of U.S. policy.  No, the division was already there well during the election. The current electoral process just refused to recognize what would in any reasonable context be considered an impasse, and it does so in a winner takes all fashion that makes it very susceptible to manipulation.  The surprising bit about Trump seems to be that he's actually following through with his campaign promises - and that speaks volumes about the current electoral process and the national and international politics that surround it.  Well, he is right about Israel's wall. There is no argument.   The west bank wall has been extremely effective at its objective, which was to stop terrorism:  http://realfacts.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/graph.png  And the Egypt wall was just as effective at stopping illegal immigrants:  https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-02-at-4.40.37-PM.png  Edit: people seem to be missing the fact that I'm talking about 2 different walls here:   * The west bank wall is the wall between Israel and Palestine and it's objective is to stop terrorists. It looks like [this](http://www.invisible-dog.com/pictures/dividing_wall_2.jpg).  * Then there is the Egypt-Israel border wall/fence the objective of which is to stop illegal immigrants from Africa, and that's what Netanyahu is referring to. It looks like [this.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/ISR-EGY_border_6521a.jpg) Another [photo](http://www.vosizneias.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Mideast-Israel-Egypt-_sham.jpg). Then why didnt Bibi tell Trump to pay for his own wall?  Thats what pisses off most Mexicans.   Trump can build his wall, thats his right, as Israel has done. But did Israel make Hamas pay for it? Of course not.  Bibi could have told Trump: walls work but pay for it yourself; its your wall.  This man lives in ""hot water"". He's plopped down in the middle of an entire region of countries that want to kill him and get rid of the Israel altogether. Trust me, he can handle a little ""hot water"".

Is anyone really surprised here? Israel is a small country with a small economy and too many enemies. It needs every bit of help it can get. Even if that means going against its very own values and principles.    So why now and not promote a wall during Obama's or Bush's term when it was even more important?   Trump is without doubt the most pro-Israel president in a long time, after good guy Clinton, and it would be foolish to let it go to waste.   Trump is also interested in contracting Israeli companies to install surveillance equipment and provide expertise, which will boost Israel's defense industry and budget.   Every country works by their own interests.  Good for Netanyahu.  No borders = No nation.  People who don't understand this maybe didn't study history?  Or pay attention?  Trump is right.  Netanyahu is right.   Define hot water. He's absolutely right in what he said. Israel's wall helped their national security immensely. I don't see how you could argue otherwise regardless of your personal feelings on Israel.  Israelis love this piece of shit. Nothing will happen. Not with me he's not. Keep it up. This is a hilarious tweet from someone who literally gives tax breaks and other financial incentives for people to illegally immigrate to Palestine.  When is he not? He should ingnore all the losers and haters Mexico voted against Israel at the UN recently, if they want Israel to be nice to them they should realize it's a two way street. Diplomacy is a bitch and Netanyahu values good ties with the US over Mexico's feel feels Mexico supported the UN resolution last month that denied the Jews historical connection to Jerusalem. So I doubt that the Israeli population care By leftists fucks who are not his target audience anyway ;) I live in Israel, Bibi is not in hot water for any of this.  In fact, that was not mentioned in any of the major news outlets. politics and twitter dont mix well... the silver lining to the trump debacle is that it will reveal extremists like netanyahu for what they are. PS: There is already a wall between US and mexico. been there at least a decade. goes all the way into the ocean. Israeli has a wall on steroids, much more secure and more militant than anything we will build Closer ties with Russia (Putin), Israel (Netanyahu), the Philippines (Duterte) and Saudi Arabia (the Wahabis). Diminish ties with China, Canada, UK, Germany, Scotland, Sweden, France, Iran, Netherlands, Mexico, and so on. Why is Reuters getting into click bait titles? He can do whatever he wants, because there is no one who wants his job. Hopefully Trump and Netanyahu can share a 4 sided ""Wall"" one day..haters   Netanyahoo is as dumb as Trump, politically. They recently found 34 tunnels under the Israel fence. Fences are symbols, and not good ones. Hardcore Israelis helped put Trump in office so this is hardly surprising. I suppose Netanyahu hasn't cottoned on that Bannon, a Neo-Nazi, is now on the security council.  Meh, just the usual schmuck making a kokhlefl. What about mexicos southern wall ? Israel is going to be crying in four years saying they didn't support Trump at all hahaha, we won't forget and they gonna pay for it. Friendly reminder that Israel has a wall to protect itself  Friendly reminder that Mexico has a wall on its Southern border to protect itself  One of the contributing factors for why most presidents don't follow through on initial election promises is because they go from a limited knowledge of the situation before office to a complete knowledge. The difference with Trump is that he knows his supporters want to see these things regardless, and we're likely to see the consequences of those decisions. > sewn division  What a serendipitously oxymoronic typo. ""International community shocked as Trump does exactly as promised."" There was a division prior to the election either but most people can't remember what they had for lunch yesterday let alone harmful political plans that took place in Obama's 2 terms.  I'm not a big fan of the ""Well you hit me, so I'll hit you"" but Obama spent 2 terms of pushing things through with or without bipartisan support and on a handful of occasions made fun of the Republican party and it's ideas.  It goes back even before Obama with the 2 parties and Americans becoming more and more polarized and allowing themselves to be influenced and influencing the national media.  EOs don't overturn shit. > No, the division was already there well during the election  So much this. It's like blaming the thermometer for the cold weather. Presidents of always trying to follow through on another campaign promises. They have a very high rate of that actually. Trump is no different than the rest. The American people would rather be fucked over behind the scenes  greece made one as well to stop the flowing from the only land border we have with turkey..  one can argue it helped (only there) but they all went from the islands later on.. just a correction on your West Bank Separation Barrier pic: it's something like 500 miles long and only about 5% is a giant concrete wall. It's for those areas with direct lines of fire on Israeli vehicles and buildings. The rest of the wall looks the same as the northern border with Lebanon: relatively low barbed wire fences. Its stopping power comes from electronic sensors and cameras, and sand paths that trackers can see footprints on. Every day patrols check the fence and paths, and additionally  any hit by the sensors results in an immediate  response (jeeps go out to that spot) that is able to catch the crossers by chasing them down on foot.  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/West_Bank_Fence_South_Hebron.JPG  http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/images/israel/fence4.jpg What do those walls have to do with a wall on the US Mexican border?  EDIT: There are no Mexican terrorists.  Ya but that doesn't fit Reddit's narrative. Walling off Israel from the West Bank is like walling off Massachusetts from Rhode Island. The scale of the Mexican border dwarfs Israel.  What is this, anti-circlejerk facts on my reddit? The Egypt-Israel wall objective was to stop ISIS and terrorist infiltrations after the Arab spring and the mayhem it caused in the Sinai peninsula (thanks Obama...). Stopping illegal immigration was just a by product.  I agree though with fact that Netanyahu is right, technically speaking all those fences and walls were very effective in stopping border crossing. It doesn't stop drugs smuggling that much because the smugglers can factor the increasing difficulty into the cost, but it reduced people smuggling for sure. ""IDF chief: 50,000 Palestinians enter Israel illegally each day""  http://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-chief-50000-palestinians-enter-israel-illegally-each-day/  This is a really bad case of correlation and causation being confused. The violence ended with the end of the second intifada, which did not happen because the wall was completed. In fact the wall still isn't complete. Palestinians go through illegally all the time for work.   The violence dropped because of political changes in Palestine. Hamas tried to act peaceful to win votes from moderates in the 2006 election, then in 2007 they were wiped out from the West Bank by the PA. That's why the main reason why the violence ended. It had little to do with the wall.  Yeah but Isreal and Pakistan hates each others guts... This is a wall between our friends and allies here!! I don't give a shit if this supposed wall were to ""work"" (There's tunnels, flying, and people who just overstay their visas.) It's a giant ugly concert fuck you to Mexico. Sure this won't end up at the top even though it's the only facts in this thread. The Egypt wall was a great idea for Israel.  The Mexico wall is a terrible idea for the US One difference is that Trump's wall is to be built on his own side of the border. I assume it goes underground as well (Egypt Wall), as at the base is just sand, pretty easy to dig under with bare hands. > And the Egypt wall was just as effective at stopping illegal immigrants:  Isn't there a lot of tunnels between Isreal and Egypt?  ... Why not use the funds to pay for the betterment of those countries instead of wasting it on a wall?   All you do by building it is create a black market for ladders and ways around it. How... how the fuck did I miss that [wall?](http://www.invisible-dog.com/pictures/dividing_wall_2.jpg) Is it low or something? I've literally never seen this in Israel.  (PS: not at all claiming that theres no wall, I 100% believe you, I'm just astounded at the fact that I've never seen it.) > extremely effective at its objective, which was to stop terrorism  [And take 9.5% of the West Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier#Loss_of_land). Is Trump going to build his wall in Mexico? >The west bank wall has been extremely effective at its objective, which was to stop terrorism:  Correlation and causation.  Terrorism dropped from 2004-2005, despite no progress on the wall. Also, the big drop happened during the early construction of the wall, whereas you'd actually expect it to happen at the end, when everything is locked down. Do you have any actual links to those statistics? Because I don't really give a flying fuck about what realfacts.co.za says the statistics are.  >http://realfacts.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/graph.png  Correlation doesn't imply causation. Why is the IDF conducting raids way beyond the Wall into Palestinian areas then? And how come all those knife attacks were not stopped in 2015 and 2016?  > between Israel and Palestine  False. The Wall is built on Palestinian lands and most of its is deep in Palestinian territory, not the 1967 borders. For this reason it was found by the International Court of Justice to be in [breach](http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?pr=71&code=mwp&p1=3&p2=4&p3=6) of international law.   In addition, th wall is a clear case of land grab to create facts on the ground. In 2013, Israel proposed making the wall its [border](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/10428164/Israel-proposes-separation-barrier-as-border-as-hopes-for-peace-talks-fade.html) with the Palestinians.     [The most striking graph is this one.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_border_barrier#Impact_on_the_number_of_illegal_migrants_entering_Hungary) You'd have to be insane not to support border barriers after seeing just how effective they are. >99% reduction in illegal immigration. So we objectively know the works. So why are the liberal establishment so against it? You've provided the undeniable truth and yet, there is a major resistance to this. As the saying goes, ""good fences make good neighbors"". Yeah but Isreal and Pakistan hates each others guts... This is a wall between our friends and allies here!! I don't give a shit if this supposed wall were to ""work"" (There's tunnels, flying, and people who just overstay their visas.) It's a giant ugly concert fuck you to Mexico. The wall wasn't effective stopping terrorists from entering Israel.   In some places you can jump over this ""wall"" without to much effort.   What was really valuable in stopping terrorists from entering is actually the cooperation of the Palestinians with the Israelies to stop terrorists. dat website tho...jesus.      I'm not arguing with the graph...The correlation between the completion of the wall and the decrease in suicide bombings is pretty compelling. But damn that site has some pretty intense propaganda. Feels like reading Orwell. The West Bank wall is illegal under International Law.  And Israel steals lands even beyond the wall by paying settlers to illegally create settlements.  There is no terrorism from Palestinians. It's called resistance. If you come into my home and keep me confined into the bathroom while you live in the rest of it. Because that piece of land using to belong to people of my religion 2000 years. I find that unfair and have no prospect in the bathroom I am locked so whenever you pass by I decide to spray shampoo in your eyes. Iwould you call me a terrorist? The wall didn't stop Israeli terrorism. Its mexican citizens being sent over, and mexico makes it hard as hell for us to send them back. Then when we do send them back, mexico makes no effort to keep them there and they just cross again. At a certain point, you get so exasperated with mexico, you have to drawl the line somewhere > Trump can build his wall, thats his right  I agree with you and I want a wall even if I pay as a taxpayer but the left will not support a wall even if Trump managed to pay for it personally   Israel has made Palestinians pay for its very existence with their land, homes and blood. That wall is a pittance in comparison.  Hamas? The wall is not between Israel and Gaza! It's between Sinai Get your facts straight > But did Israel make Hamas pay for it? Of course not.  Why would they make Hamas pay for it when they can send the bill to Washington and get everything paid for and a few billion dollars extra as compensation for not paying for their wall sooner? Why shouldn't Mexico contribute to building the wall? If my neighbors dog constantly ran into my yard, wouldn't he have a responsibility to help build a barrier to stop it? Mexico has a duty to prevent their nationals from illegally crossing into our country. There is a shared responsibility here and there should be a shared cost.  ""Oh, the innocent Israel keeps finding new enemies, totally innocent"" I'd also like to point out that Israeli citizens are banned from entering numerous countries:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_passport#/media/File%3AVisa_requirements_for_Israeli_citizens.png  As time goes by, I find myself becoming more and more pro-Israel. They have a far more progressive society than their neighbours, and a quality of life comparable to Europe to an extent. They don't have corruption funneling development money into the hands of the wealthy who then incite violence in the population, instead actually supporting it's citizens.  I don't like Netanyahu because he isn't very diplomatic, but people need to realise Israel is in a very tough position. i dont know why israelis thinks trump is some kind of jew lover ... the guy said so many lies and things that never happen or will.. i mean he doesn't even believe in global warming >Trump is without doubt the most pro-Israel president in a long time, after good guy Clinton, and it would be foolish to let it go to waste.    You ever hear of Steve Bannon?   Edit, for the denialists:  >In light of what theyve found, the Bannon appointment has been decried by a variety of rights groups and liberal politicians, from Harry Reid to the Anti-Defamation League. Just about all of the statements that have been issued accuse Bannon of promoting white nationalism or anti-Semitism on Breitbart, and some accuse Bannon himself of being a white nationalist or an anti-Semite (the Huffington Post explicitly referred to Bannon as an anti-Semite in its headline on the controversy).     >  Regarding another academy, The Archer School for Girls, the ex-wife claimed Bannon went on to say the biggest problem he had with Archer is the number of Jews that attend. He said that he doesnt like Jews and that he doesnt like the way they raise their kids to be whiney brats and that he didnt want the girls going to school with Jews.

Can you show me exact borders of Israel on Map? Forget about him for a minute. The wall between the West Bank and Israel has prevented any suivide bomb attacks which were common in the second intifada - that killed both Israelis and American tourists. What's the problem exactly? The wall between us and Egypt stops illegal immigration. What's the problem exactly? They love him as much as Americans love Trump. [Not really.](https://knessetjeremy.com/2017/01/17/channel-2-poll-yesh-atid-26-likud-24-joint-list-13-bayit-yehudi-12-zionist-union-11/)  >Should Netanyahu resign?  >**44% Yes**, 43% No, 13% Dont know Well he's not wrong. A wall (or maybe it was a fence) has stopped nearly all illegal immigration via Egypt. I understand that its a bit different than Trump's proposal but Netanyahu is right, walls work They don't care for his corruption because he is good at killing Muslims  How can you immigrate to a state which does not exist? He can't help that they were born fucked up!  The whole world except the US votes against Israel in the UN. Perhaps it is because Israel keeps violating International Law. No need to hold grudges against those who point out the obvious.  Sometimes there's a price to pay for doing the right thing. Mexico behaviour was apt. There was no UN resolution that denied Jewish historical connection to Jerusalem. This is called Fake News. The first page of the resolution clearly says that ""Jews, Muslims, and Christians have a historical connection to Jerusalem"". You are lying out of your ass.  It didn't do any such thing. It compelled Israel to abide by its obligations towards historical sites on the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem, which Israel systematically ignores, at least when those sites are not Jewish. Israel threw a tantrum to deflect this reasonable criticism making the world focus on whether the importance for Judaism of the Temple Mount should have been mentioned, which was entirely besides the point in the resolution.  Wait isnt Duterte going to China? Yeah the guy in power for more time than you've probably been alive is a real political idiot.  >a kokhlefl  Are you guys hiding another delicious middle eastern dish from me that you don't want me to try? Friendly reminder that Mexico has no wall on it's southern border... which anyone that have been there could tell you. Friendly reminder Israel ask people to immigrate to illegal lands on palestinian's territory. I blame the media for mocking Trump and claiming that his supporters were duped when Trump seemed to be backing off some promises.  They should've been praising it if they actually cared about the country but instead needed to get a shot at the opposition.  The previous presidents in recent have enacted, or at least seriously attempted, most of their campaign promises throughout their terms though. Thats not why. Trump got it figured out, more knowledge for him, means more opportunities.  Should've been 'sown', right? > 500 miles long  Woah, that's way off. The full size was meant to be 440 miles long, but they stopped below 300. It also runs through lands that are agreed upon as occupied by the international community including the United States and Canada. Trump said some parts of border will just be fences. Because some areas are very inhospitable anyone crazy enough to take those routes deserve to get in. i thought this movie was good http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1172963/ Proof of concept Reddit often feels like two groups of extremists talking past each other.  An echo chamber of selective ignorance.   How about you do some research before you go around acting all smug?  http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/03/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/  The number of illegal immigrants has remained mostly the same since 2009, and a vast majority have been in the country for over 10 years.  Aka people are not crossing the border. 40% fly here.   Putting up a wall on the US border will do absolutely nothing to halt illegal immigration into the US because it is a fact that most of our immigrants come here either legally or from other places.  The situation in those other countries is very different. It doesnt fit the narrative because in reality it doesn't make sense. It's literally the top post in the thread. People need to stop preemptively whining. This is literally the top voted comment. If it wouldn't fit with REddit's narrative it wouldn't be upvoted so much. I dont care about whether the walls in Israel are effective or not. I care about Netanyahu trying to become best buddies with Trump and the implications it has for the people of the world but also the Israeli people.   Netanyahu and Trump are fueling the conflict again and when shit hits the fan it means a lot of dead Palestinians, but also dead Israelis. The radical right is gambling with Israeli lifes to expand their power within and the power of Israel. But that power won't mean peace.  Also the situation in Israel is completely differebt than in the US. For instance Israel is ten times as densely populated as the US and the border can be easily patrolled, opposed to the long stretch of nothingness shared between the US and Mexico. Stop it with this fucking canned response. It's irritating. Find a new way to say this if it's going to be said over and over again. The scale of the US also dwarfs Israel. The US-Mexico border is about 10 times as long as the Israel-Egypt border, but the US budget is about 50 times bigger than Israel's budget. The number of Palestinians entering Israel illegally is irrelevant. Like I clearly said, the objective of the Palestinian wall was not to stop Palestinians from entering Israel illegally, but to stop Palestinian terrorists from smuggling weapons. Besides, your own article contradicts your claims:  > We are making efforts to close the open border areas. There are still 100 kilometers of border without a security wall, he said adding that securing particularly vulnerable areas in Gush Eztion, south of Jerusalem, would cost an estimated NIS 260 million.  He says the wall is effective, and the issue arises due to some areas not being walled, which they are working on.  If you want to talk about the relevance of a wall to stopping illegal immigration, you should refer to the Egypt-Israel wall. Wrong wall dude.  Another difference is that the wall you're referring reduced suicide attacks on Israeli civilians by 99%, whereas the only thing the wall on the Mexican border will reduce by 99% is the opening of new Mexican restaurants. Making tunnels that don't cave in is difficult and expensive, and they're easy to find with seismic sensors. You haven't been to the area. The only sandy strip between Israel and Egypt is few miles from the Mediterranean inland. Rest of it is very much hard rock.  The tunnels are between Gaza and Egypt. Because it's on the border and you have not been there? It's not exactly in the most touristy place. Im guessing you never went to where the wall is? Based on  a few minutes of googling, it looks like theres a few walls of various sorts built there Israel withdraws from 90% of the West Bank and 100% of the Gaza Strip and you attempt to spin it into exactly the opposite. Genius. [removed] The first stage was to finish the wall in the most critical areas, which allowed the IDF to focus on the less critical ones. It took time to adapt, but it clearly worked. Then they finished the second stage, which locked down the holes completely. As someone with info from the inside about thwarted attacks - BS. The wall is as effective as it can be. Check his history.  It is all he comments on. It might be true and it might not be true. I do not have time to check the real facts from Zambia. The problem with citing that as an example is because those illegal immigrants were not going to hungary, they were going through hungary. All they did was go around.  If they wanted to get in, they could easily scale that wall with a cheap ladder and some wire cutters.  I congratulate the palestinians on their heroic [resistance against 13 year old girls in their bedrooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Hallel_Yaffa_Ariel). I hate to break it to you but it is not 'resistance', it is murder.  Well, originally you had no house at all. You were renting the house from some Turk guy and then a British guy got the house and you were renting to him. Then the British guy decided to split the house between you and some new guy, but instead of accepting that, you decided to try and murder the new guy.  Now you are locked in the bathroom as a result (you are not really locked though, you are free to leave the house if you want), and yet you still refuse to negotiate with the new guy and you throw stuff at him whenever possible. That's a hilarious typo. Southern states have to drawl the line! WAT?  Mexico is a free country like the USA.  People are free to come and go.   Nobody is ""sent over.""  And a free country dont make it ""hard as hell"" to go back.  And its up to a free citizens to stay.   Regardless if a goverment makes a good effort or not.   Why do a million US citizens born in the USA, are living their lives outside the USA?    Did the US goverment fail to keep them their?   Does the USA NEED to make a WALL to keep them from leaving?    Why do YOU people think its ok to make Mexico make a wall to keep its citizens in?  Its ridiculous and downright racist toward Mexico, expecting them to do something that you wont accept from your own country. Pretty sure if he is able to have the wall built without taxpayers help most people wouldn't mind as much. But... a multibillion dollar wall and the infrastructure to support building/maintaining it won't come cheap. > but the left will not support a wall even if Trump managed to pay for it personally  Not true. I'm a huge lefty but if he wants to spend his own money, go for it!  Coming from a man that bitches and moans about windmills being too ugly and sues to get them removed wherever he doesn't want them, it sure is rich that everyone are to be okay with a 3k mile long wall being erected at their expense.    Hey that a good idea.  Trump can sell off his billions, and pay for the wall himself.  Left can cry a river over it, but since its his money they could not stop him. The wall will also be an environmental catastrophe. It's not just about money.  point is, you dont get someone else to pay for something YOU want If my dog goes into your yard because you have no fence to keep anything out, not just my dog, but ANY dog, you need to build a fence.   Mexico is a FREE country.  Does the USA prevent ITS CITIZENS from leaving if they want to go?  Jesus Christ Mary and Joseph! Lol, ok. Israel was invaded by seven Arab armies literally a day after it declared independence, because they wanted to destroy it. To this day, every single enemy Israel fought, were fighting Israel because **they thought Israel should not exist**.   Conversely, Israel never said it doesn't think Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt etc. should cease to exist. And the moment a country relinquished its dream of destroying Israel, and made peace with it, that infamous ""Israeli aggression"" against them miraculously stopped. Funny that.   Finally, the settlements, the occupation, and other problems a Westerner might have with Israel, are simply *not* the problem Israel has with its enemies. The people who actually attack Israel, think all of Israel is one big occupation, all Israeli cities and villages are settlements, and no Israeli borders could ever be legitimate borders. A great recent example is Iran, who literally opposed the Palestinian bid for UN membership, because it implied Israel should be allowed to exist too. The occupation and settlements only bother people who think Israel should be allowed to exist in *any* borders, like its Western allies, and those don't really attack Israel.  So yeah, despite your silly sarcasm, the view that evil Israel attacking its peaceful neighbors out of pure Zio-bloodlust, is complete and utter horseshit. Israel, since its inception, has only been fighting those who explicitly want to destroy it.  right israel is the devil along side the jews i see where your coming,a real democractic point of view,  the amount of jews leaving europe because of the hate from islam isnt not true,just wait few years until europe will be conqueror by islam,but i guess you wont care much since you sit with your chair in great house in america ""look mom im being an anti-semite on the internet.""  why dont you go back to the_donald, kid.

I don't like Netanyahu either. At least now, that is. A few years back he was a respectable prime minister worth the title. His years as PM have radicalized him though, but despite voting against him, I do admit he's a very smart man. Even more so, he gets a lot more shit than he deserves, even if his world view is quite radically different than mine. You could say the same thing about Apartheid South Africa or French Algeria.  I didn't say I support Trump. He's an idiot for many reasons. However, having such opportunity, it would be a stupid decision to not use it to Israel's advantage.    Trump supported Israel on key decisions such as anti-Israel UN agenda and resolutions, Iran deal parameters, and ideological issues such as embassy location. This is why many people favor him over Obama, who in his last few weeks made some very damaging anti-Israel moves.  > i dont know why israelis thinks trump is some kind of jew lover   Trump's two closest advisors and confidants are Jewish, his daughter and his son-in-law, and his base is overwhelmingly zionist (alt-right aside) They're too distracted by someone that ignores the settlement building to see Trump for who he actually is.  That's why. Are you calling Steve Bannon an anti semitic? When breitbart has a Jerusalem section and a Jewish editor in-chief. Great job listening to a smear campaign by the media. You also believe that Trump took out the MLK statue from the white house?  Steve Bannon is a piece of shit, but even Ben Shapiro, a massive jewish conservative who worked within breitbart for years, claims that bannon was not anti semitic. He's not a US president, nor ever was. Pretty sure that native Americans would have lived much happier lives if they didn't allow immigrants/refugees in their country... False equivalency.  The border between the US and Mexico is immensely longer, and the situation immensely more complex. Mexico is an ally and important trade partner; Israel cannot say the same of Egypt. Exactly 0 terrorists have ever come to the US through Mexico. The cartels have extensive tunnel and boat networks that ignore the land border entirely. A wall does nothing for them.  All this Trump wall does is prevent a few poor people from getting jobs on the other side and making enough money to build a real life for themselves.And, of course, make Trump look like a god to his constituents who have been brainwashed into thinking Mexicans have an evil plot to get rid of white Americans. Lets just put a wall between every state. Ill feel safe  Well the wall hasn't prevented Israel breaking the cease fire nearly 80% of th time  or Israeli planes bombing it's neighbours.  Not really.  The Israeli authorities find new tunnels under both of these walls several times every year. It's such a problem they're talking about building ""underground walls"". The wall didn't stop shit. The second intifada ended due to political changes in Palestine. The wall had virtually no effect and its still easy for Palestinians to illegally travel to Israel, they do it every day for work.  How does it prevent them when all attacks would be on west bank settlers who aren't behind the wall? The wall is illegal because it goes *through* Palestine. Imagine if Trump's wall carved parts of Mexico into the US in the name of 'security' No wall to stop illegal immigration into the West Bank though huh?  Because there's a constant influx of suicide bombers from Mexico crossing the borders! (Which already have a fence like the one Israel has to stop immigration) It is the same leftist Israeli Channel 2 that predicted that the Zionist Union is going to beat Likud in the last elections. Resign in favour of whom?   Not true. just turned the enemy into mole people. They recently found 34 tunnels. http://www.thetower.org/3704-israeli-officials-hamas-digging-six-miles-of-tunnels-every-month/ >because he is good at killing Muslims  As an Israeli it's outstanding how little you guys understand Israeli politics or even what happens here, Bibi is not only not ""good at killing Muslims"" he's one of the prime ministers most likely to shy away from violent confrontation in the last twenty years if not in Israeli history. [They do care about it.](https://knessetjeremy.com/2017/01/17/channel-2-poll-yesh-atid-26-likud-24-joint-list-13-bayit-yehudi-12-zionist-union-11/)  >Do you believe Netanyahus version?  >**54% No**, 28% Yes, 18% Dont know What Muslims is he killing? The hilarious thing is how much more accurate this is than trump's charge against Mexicans.  Mexicans immigrate for a better life, Jewish folks from New York or elsewhere moving to a settlement in the West Bank are almost always taking a downgrade in standards of living for purely nationalistic/religious purposes.   Keep crying And then it goes on to say that the temple mount complex is a Muslim holy place without mentioning at all that it might have some significance to Jews, I mean, it's not like Jews built the complex originally or anything. You are fake news, they omitted the fact the Temple mount is the holiest place for Jews but stressed that it is for the Arabs. That's even more sneaky and dishonest. Do you realize that even the head of UNESCO, Irina Bokova, admitted that this resolution is wrong?  I thought he was personally invited to the White House with some of his buddies who have shares or naming rights for the Trump Tower project.   You are double incorrect.  Netanyahoo has  been  in deep political trouble a few times. http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.710777   He is now. He blusters around like trump. Their arrogance shows in political aggression.   I'm not fan of the Israelis either I'm just pointing out a disparity  Apparently a US Wall is racist when other countries around the world do it freely. The media, like us, only get part of the story, the rest of the information is known by the government. The media is an easy scapegoat, and I will say Trump has done an impressive job turning them into the lightning rod when the POTUS position historically does.  Here's what needs to be recognized, the concept of patriotism has been completely skewed. Countries such as Germany, Britain, France etc have a lineage they can trace back hundreds of years and use as a sense of national identity, we do not. What makes up our national identity is our values and ideals, which ironically makes us similar to the USSR which was a similar way. Here's the thing, it means that no amount of immigrants or different nationalities will effect our national identity because it isn't physical, that makes it more and less resilient than those of countries with extended lineage.  What is a threat to our identity is the threat to our ideals and values, as a land of the free and home of the brave, a land of immigrants and opportunity. When that ideal is mutated, and distorted into being a policy of America First and shutting out those who want access that is the real threat to America. We are the home of the brave not because we display our strength but because we can reserve it, and we do not worry about those who can hurt us because they cannot hurt **who we are**. The second we sacrifice our values for our security is when we become unpatriotic, because we can exude strength through example not by show of force. When we begin to not recognize ourselves, that is when we know we have lost.  Most important of all, the people do not serve the president, the president serves the people. The president will and should be subjected to scrutiny to ensure that they fulfill the needs of the people, because they are a public *servant*. The POTUS shouldn't be an unquestionable position that demands respect, it should be a position that earns respect depending on its ability to benefit the nation. Because we've been drifting towards a more populist view, people want to see these promises fulfilled and therefore the candidates have more pressure to do so because they value their approval rating and the prospect of getting re-elected.   It's also worth noting that presidential powers have grown substantially in the last few administrations and therefore they have more things they can do day 1 without waiting for Congress. It's a case of instant and delayed gratification, which policies will seem to work in the short term and cause problems once he's out of office compared to policies that don't seem to work initially but have positive effects in the long term. It's the same focus on instant gratification politics that lead to 9/11. Thats what you've already had for years theres already a fence there.  Deserve to get in....?  Life as a moderate is a special kind of hell. > An echo chamber of selective ignorance  oh sweet god, that would be the perfect reddit catchphrase.  Especially with refugees. Before Trump, there was constsnt news about refugees causing trouble in europe. But with Trump the US is somehow evil for not wanting to have the shit shows thats in Europe. I really think only one side deserves to be called extremists on /r/worldnews. Nah just full of kiddies/millennials who are just starting to get into politics, reaching about that age, so their knowledge experience or datatbase is extremely limited to get a real logical view on things. It's almost entirely formed by the media and whatever their professors or popular word is amongst their peers, which are also influenced by the same sources, then you have the tribalism team mentality where they just support whatever their side is spewing out regardless of what it is. Particularly with people just desperate to grab things in regard to trump.  B-but Trump is either the new racist/rapist/sexist/homophobic/transphobic Hitler or he's the second coming of Christ!!!! >Aka people are not crossing the border. 40% fly here.  So you're saying the vast majority (60%) come in by land and can be stopped by a wall?  The wall is not Trump's only plan to reduce illegal immigration. You understand that...right? Budget doesn't matter. The fact is you cannot properly man a 2000 mile long stretch of land. well, If the US wants it's wall, the american taxpayer should pay for it . The difference in scale between a Mexico-America border and the Israel-Egypt border is a significant factor of effectiveness. The larger a wall the more holes in its defense. >The number of Palestinians entering Israel illegally is irrelevant.  If people can get in illegally, so can weapons. You are spouting utter nonsense.  > your own article contradicts your claims:  That is not a contradiction, he didn't even say that those sections are at fault for the illegal immigrants, nor did he provide any evidence for that.   But wouldn't the wall reduce drug trafficking? I was trying to make a joke, albeit not a good one. Wow what did I just read?   I shouldn't lock my door. It is police obligation to guard my stuff  If I build a fence around my yard I'm going to steal an inch of their property because I want them out, and they'll be paying for it [America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATF_gunwalking_scandal) is [responsible](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/07/2012721152715628181.html) for a lot [worse.](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-us-government-and-the-sinaloa-cartel-2014-1?IR=T)  I could pull up similar [links](http://humansarefree.com/2015/02/overwhelming-evidence-that-cia-is.html) for every single letter I type but I dont think it'll make any difference.  *I know people connected to one of Europes biggest drug smugglers, apparently the [army and cia](http://www.globalresearch.ca/heroin-dealer-in-chief-afghanistan-source-of-90-of-the-worlds-heroin/5502813) control nearly 90% of the worlds heroin supply - if that chart half way down the page with numbers of hectares grown going up each year since America got involved and the corresponding number of Americans dying from heroin use getting higher every year doesnt make you angry I dont know what will. What's that info As if Israel doesn't butcher kids in hospitals by the thousands.  My parents have the lease to the land. My grandfather owned that land. The British guy stole the house and gave it to you. Stop spreading fake news. Anyways I wish there is peace between both parties soon. But for occupied Palestine (what you call Israel) to become a successful country it will have to make compensations to the indigenous people and follow the example of New Zealand. This is complete bullshit. Nothing about Palestine was Turkish, it was part of the Ottoman empire and those Arabs, whose ancestors have lived there for millennia, had their representation in the parliament of the Ottoman empire. Eventually during the Arab revolt, the Arabs fought against the Ottoman empire with the help of the British for their complete independence and the British promised them that independence. The British then back-stabbed the Arabs with the Balfour declaration and then later on, Zionist groups in Palestine started conducting terrorist attacks against both the Arabs and the British. Don't try to spin it around. While funny, it should be noted that the traditional 'southern drawl' is a southeast thing. In the southwest it's a mexican accent. Texas is the transition area between the two southern accents. Its so free, the citizens flee the country by the millions to come to the united states The mayor of NYC is literally okay with illegal immigrants breaking the law. This is the kind of mental gymnastics in force. OH! How's it feel paying for things you don't agree with? We pay $2-3000 a year for illegals, and we're sick of it. A wall is a drop in the bucket compared to the money saved when get rid of them. I didn't say that Except that's not the rule. Your dog, your responsibility to control it and prevent it from entering someone else's property. Same concept. They should prevent their citizens from illegally entering the property of their neighbor. But it benefits them so they don't care. That needs to change. The USA would not allow me to go somewhere I am not legally authorized to go. But I thought diaspora Jews love healthy multiculturalism? The Jewish diaspora in Europe played a significant role in the multicultural project in much of mainland Europe after the tragedy of the holocaust.   I'm more worried about Europe being conquered by fascists. Israeli here: it's not mutually exclusive. We might have big problems with corruption, and it's certainly more corrupt than I'd like my country to be. But compared to the neighboring countries, let alone something like the kleptocratic PA, it's much better. Compared to Western Europe, not so much. We're somewhere near the bottom of the scale for Western countries, along with the likes of Czechia.  We have large-scale corruption, like mayors getting bribes for million-dollar projects, mostly in the housing sector. And those, are often dealt with - we literally have *several* former mayors and  a PM in jail for that. But you wouldn't bribe a cop out of a ticket, or a headmaster to get into a school, for example. > The israelis I know claim the country has huge corruption problems.  The Israelis who claim that have never seen what a real corruption looks like. again he doesnt do anything.. he just SAYS he does or tweet about it like a teenager... it's still doesn't the government stance ....yeah pretty good summary, and I find this very funny tbh. The group that supports Israel under trump is the basic conservative, who straight up support Israel, and then there is the alt right, who strongly support trumps actions, and unlike the conservative supporters, despise Israel. If this were, to say, Obama with a jewish daughter and a pro israel following, the alt right would absolutely lose their shit. Token gesture.  [Google is your friend.](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/11/yes-steve-bannon-asked-why-a-school-had-many-hanukkah-books.html)   > Regarding another academy, The Archer School for Girls, the ex-wife claimed Bannon went on to say the biggest problem he had with Archer is the number of Jews that attend. He said that he doesnt like Jews and that he doesnt like the way they raise their kids to be whiney brats and that he didnt want the girls going to school with Jews. nice token jesture Wow a former employee and literal partisan butt buddy won't slander someone substantially more powerful than him. How shocking!  It's cute that you try to seem to non-partisan by stating that Bannon is a piece of shit tho.  You are right. But you are going to make the hivemind furious with that comment. Which makes it pretty hypocritical for the descendants of colonists to bitch now about immigration. The US has never been an ethnostate and will never become one, no matter how much the ""alt-right"" barks about it.  Apparently cartel members crossing the border with drugs but end up slaughtering some guy's innocent family isn't terrorism, it's just gang violence.  More complex? The us mexico relationship is like 2+2 compared to how complex the middle east situation is   Portable walls. Everyone could have their own.  I just want a wall around california. Plus it hasn't stopped them from sending their zionist spy sharks to attack unsuspecting civilians. Also wild boars. By preventing terrorism he actually means inhibiting resistance to colonial oppression. No tunnels from West Bank. Only gaza.  Those tunnels are not under ""both of these walls"". They are under a separate third wall on the border with Gaza, and the objective of those tunnels is to infiltrate Hamas terrorist squads into Israel in case of another war. Those are one time use tunnels. And you can carry far less people/weapons through a tunnel than over an unsecured border. No wall will stop every illegal entry but in Israels case the Egyptian border fence stopped >99% of it > The second intifada ended due to political changes in Palestine.  You think Palestinians electing Hamas is what *stopped* suicide bombings?  Well that's a new one. Lol it stopped suivide bombings  Except it isn't about Palestinians going to Israel for work, it's about stopping suicide bombings and attacks from the West Bank, which it has been very effective. It prevents suicide attacks. Many of the attacks in the last two years were stabbings and car ramming attacks by Palestinians who entered Israel or already lived there  What are you talking about? There are attacks and attempted attacks on Israelis within Israel proper all the time. >Imagine if Trump's wall carved parts of Mexico into the US in the name of 'security'  Did you think New Mexico has that name by coincidence?   It *is* being built on Mexican land. Texas, New Mexico, Arizona -- those places are every bit as Mexican as the land on the Israeli side of the wall is Palestinian. If he resigns it will trigger an election. Right now there will be a power vacuum Doesn't matter. It goes against the /r/worldnews Israeli/Jewish hate train.  Man, you're good at this. > What Muslims is he killing?  More Palestinians have died in the Syrian civil war than in the past 20 years in Palestine.  I would say Redstateraghead should alter his viewpoint. Netanyahu isn't as good *""at killing Muslims""* as Muslims are. Damn son we tradin in stereotypes?  The Jews built the mosque? That's a highly unusual historical perspective.   They didn't talk about the history of the Temple Mount at all. They just said that muslim access was restricted to a site holy to them. It is irrelevant whether the pre-Roman ruins underneath it are holy to Jews. That doesn't have anything to do with the point of the resolution.  WHILE TALKING ABOUT RESTRICTIONS OF MUSLIMS TO THE MOSQUE. Jewish connection to the site is completely irrelevant in any and every way.  If you read her statement she speaks in generalities and hypotheticals and was responding to absolute hysteria and accusations of anti-semitism from Israel. havent heard that, but ppl are saying Duterte is just China's puppet. I know he is friendlier to Trump, but if he had to choose between Trump and Xi he would back Xi. Do another countries in the world demand a wal unilaterally and demanding the other country has to for it?  America and Israel can fuck themselves. The world is finally seeing what fascist countries they are. Well said. A lot of people are frustrated w their position in life and are blaming the govt which has resulted in a ""burn it down"" politics. We would do well to go back to our roots and what makes the US exceptional. So true.  Trumps supposed plans are that walls are erected in high-risk zones.    Fences are erected in low-risk zones.   Tunnels have been solved by the Israeli defense force years ago and will be implemented.    Add to all this a promised missile shield and IR cameras.     Don't ya know? Trump loves hard work and self-reliance. I just want people to stop screaming at each other. We're all big dumb apes, and I wish more of us would realize that. Everyone thinks they're a moderate. I've found the best way to bring peace of mind is Kraken black rum mixed with Barq's root beer, or drugs. It really is. I don't think Trump is Hitler but he's not Superman either. He's a president who has some good ideas and some bad, and they're all pretty unconventional of a president to do. But no one wants to just say he's ""controversial."" No, he has to be perfect or evil without any in between. As a moderate with a novelty account the best I can do is scream and make absurd contrarian posts against whichever side of extremists I'm feeling particularly angsty about at the moment.  Then I get off my ass and on with my week after I get it out of system :) Don't be a moderate, then. Neither side of the ""political spectrum"" appeals to you because it is a false dichotomy. Fight authoritarianism and globalism without ceding intellectual ground to your real enemies who comprise the Left and the Right.  Yes, this requires coming out and admitting to your friends and family that you think the entire system that provides their lives and wellbeing is a bullshit farce, that is the onus of the modern intellectual. Because youre too dumb to realize being a moderate doesn't make you right.  DAE HORSESHOE THEORY GUYS!!!! r/europe was the most interesting case.  They went from NO-FUCKING-THANKS to #REFUGEESWELCOME literally overnight.  Plus you have all these kids claiming people ""have no idea"" what's going on in Europe. I have no idea why they're trying to cover up for them.  I live in Europe, these immigrants are horrible ""news"" > So you're saying the vast majority (60%) come in by land and can be stopped by a wall?  40% flying in doesn't mean that the other 60% walk across.  The majority of those coming by land come through legal border checkpoints, and overstay their visas.  Oh, and there's also those coming by water. Most illegal immigrants come here legally and overstay their visas. A lot of them are Canadian. No because they already jump over the current ones (there are already places with double barriers). They will just go through tunnels. Some even go through customs stowed away. And surprise! Many ICE officers are corrupt and just let them through.  A wall doesn't stop people who can buy a ladder.  We understand that, the point is the wall specifically is a waste of time and money. Israels isn't completely manned either? Sensors, cameras, drones, patrols, DMZs etc. take care of the rural parts. Sure you can, if you have 10 times as many people, which we do. The import of drugs would probably stop for a while but drug use over all will not stop. Drugs made in the US will increase and as a result crime too.  [Don't think so.](https://www.amazon.com/Freefly-Systems-ALTA-UAV/dp/B013OMDM6Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1485789270&sr=8-1&keywords=heavy+drone)   IMHO . only an effective way to block the money or legalization of drugs will block the trafficking. Nah man, I got it... Poor Jew here Uh Jordan invaded Israel in 1967, not vice versa. It's theirs. They took it from Jordan and Jordan renounced all claims to the land when they signed a peace treaty with Israel in the 90's. Looks like Mike Pence's reddit account.  That dude is fucking delusional lmao People on reddit claim all sorts of shit in their compulsive need to be right. Yeah I'm Israeli and i killed at least 7000 Muslim children with my bare hands but you kind of need the blood of at least 1000 children to make a proper matza so I guess that isn't that much since I only eat that shit during passover.  Recently more people have been going to South Africa than the USA Maybe he should be mayor of El Paso for a few years before chiming in. the wall would be good for mexico in the long run, though the view is that ALL mexicans hate it  no more weapons and ammos or toxic waste going into mexico, through the open desert in the middle of the night  no more illegals from central america or where ever using mexico as a trampoline into the USA, and staying in mexico when they cant  mexicans vote out, or revolt out, the bad mexican politicians who NOW use the border to export mexicos economic problems  With a Trumps wall in place they cant do that anymore.  Trump promised a wall, more Mexicans than you think in Mexico wish him well.  But America has to pay for it.  Not Mexico, thats just plum crazy. Its not the only dog in the world, other dogs, or people will also go into your yard, you need to protect it from everything, not just my dog.  Their is no way you can make some one else, build something for you on your property.  USA can not stop you from going, it can make it against the law, buts its un enforceable. They can only get you when you got back.  And if you dont, they cant.  If you want dogs out of your yard, build a fence, if you want to leave the USA to Cuba or North Korea, you can.   Once back THEN you get in trouble.  If they even find out. Good to know. Politicians in my country have no deterrent to not give million dollar projects to their friends in Canada. He cancelled the $221 Million in aid to Palestine, who has a fund that rewards the families of those who use suicide attacks against Israel, and began a process of defunding the UN (Which, by the way, was originally proposed by and supported by the three GOP Senators that most hate Trump - McCain, Graham, and Rubio). I think alt-right's stance is 'do what Israel does'. The alt-right has an interesting relationship with Israel. The anti-semitism leads to plenty of hatred but there's also a lot of respect since Israel is the sort of state they want America to be, an explicit ethnic state.  Bannon's ex-wife, key point. Ex-wife's don't talk, Actions do. Btw this was said by a Trump hit-piece.  Extra - accused him of during divorce proceedings.  You would say anything to get more than half of your ex-husband's wealth.  Dude, Breitbart was literally created by a Jew, in fact the name is that Jews family name. You'd be hard press to find a more Jewish newspaper that isn't intended for Jews or Israelis. Have you watched ben shapiro? Ben literally rants about how stupid breitbart has become and states how much he despises steve bannon. Also no need to be so aggressive, its a discussion over the internet.    Heres a video of ben shapiro on breitbart.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-fanAsrY_s Mostly just bitching about illegal immigration. The US supports legal immigration in large numbers.  [Gallup Polling](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1660/immigration.aspx) Native Americans were conquered. Colonists didn't immigrate, they COLONIZED. Is it so hard to understand? we saw how well having open borders worked for native americans and we decided ""no thanks, none of that for me"" It is not, since the definition of terrorism is using violence to advance a political or sociological ideal.   The cartels kill to make money. It is very clearly gang violence. Just because some people want terrorism to be ""anyone that commits a crime while non-white"" doesn't mean it is. Words, like facts, exist in their true form for a reason, and bending them to prove your point is nothing less than delusional.  isnt it?  Dude. Fuck trump. You should be president  If we just do the southern part, is that fine? Hmmm. And what makes you think Trump's wall will mimic the success of the walls in the West Bank, rather than the at-best-partial-success of the walls in Gaza? The attacks reduced dramatically about a year prior to the elections. Hamas dropped references to destroy Israel from its campaign platform, and reduced attacks significantly. This is why the entire campaign revolved around corruption rather then Israel, and why Hamas won. Exit polls showed that the Palestinian people opposed Hamas's policies towards Israel despite the fact that they voted for them. It had nothing to do with them winning the legislative elections, which had no impact on policies towards Israel. The legislature doesn't control relations with Israel or foreign policy.  No it didnt. That ended because of the end of the second intifada.  The whole point is that if 50,000 Palestinians can enter Israel illegally for work each day then it's pretty clear that the partially constructed wall is ineffective. The end of violence at the end of the second intifada had nothing to do with the wall, it was because of political changes in Palestine.  How does the wall prevent suicide attacks on settlers?  > Many of the attacks in the last two years were stabbings and car ramming attacks by Palestinians who entered Israel or already lived there.   When was the most recent? You forgot this /s  While that is true, going even further takes it to another level.  Of course, but who is more liked by Israelis? The 44% saying he should step down would obviously need to prefer an alternative. What stereotypes? About settlers? Settlements have less access to universities, work, civic services, etc.  people don't immigrate to the West Bank for a better life.  They have restricted movement, they have to stay within a limited confined area, there are fewer nearby jobs, etc.  The motivations for immigrating to a settlement in the West Bank are entirely religious or nationalistic.  Am I wrong? Please explain.    Edit: just to be clear, I am *NOT* saying settlers are rapists and killers or whatever words trump used to describe Mexicans.  But that the ""they're not sending their best"" business certainly applies to religious zealots and ultra nationalists more than people seeking work and better standards of living.  Dude, the mountain is half artificial, the whole compound the mosque is on was built by Jews. People don't really get this, the mountain wasn't big enough for Herods design so they enlarged it, or did you actually think that such a large totally flat and rectangular plaza came into existence naturally.  Building a religious building over another religions holiest site and then claiming it as your own, even while the very foundations that support your holly site were built by the people you just disenfranchised is a pretty dick move.  >They just said that muslim access was restricted to a site holy to them.   So is Jewish access, far more than Muslim access.  >It is irrelevant whether the pre-Roman ruins underneath it are holy to Jews.  Again, it's not some ruins buried underground, it's the literal megastructure the mosque is situated upon (actually for the record there are two mosques on it since it is pretty humongous). In between your other mistakes, not pre-Roman also, it was built during the Roman period and it's existence was well-documented and recorded, far more than a lot of other historical stuff which are considered absolute historical truth.  >That doesn't have anything to do with the point of the resolution.  It does because the resolution addresses only Muslim rights while giving lip service to Jews and Christians at the start, furthermore it never acknowledges any of the sites by any name beside the Muslim one, going so far as putting the wailing wall in quotations and referring to it as the Burak wall (because Muhammad tied his flying horse to that wall if we want to talk about irrelevant beliefs).  What restrictions? When they don't throw stones on the jews praying below there are no restrictions. Unlike Jewish holy sites in Arab countries which Jews can't even visit. http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/12/philippines-roger-duterte-donald-trump-invitation-161202192230991.html Well seen as this is Mexico's problem I don't see why they shouldn't pay for it, US has the upper hand economically in this matter. What made us exceptional was an industrial machine during a time the rest of the developed world was bombing the shit out of each other and destroying each other's countries. But that was a long time ago and we don't make things the same way, we have robots make them now. > Tunnels have been solved by the Israeli defense force years ago   How? > Tunnels have been solved by the Israeli defense force years ago and will be implemented.  This is straight up wrong. Did you mean to reply to a different comment? I'm very much a moderate, I agree with both sides on some things and am completely against demonizing both sides and will likely vote for different parties on ballots. I'm a radical moderate extremist.  I'm not racist or biggoted enough to be a Conservative, I'm also not scared enough of people having differing opinions or saying 'bad' words to be a liberal. I fall somewhere in the middle. Why not both! He doesn't have many good ideas Hah I feel the same way. Not a great way to score Internet points though. > Fight authoritarianism and globalism  Why should he fight globalism? This is just another smear word for ""globalization"" which is inevitable. We can't fight this and we shouldn't, because it's a good thing.   ""Authoritarianism"" became an empty word. Leftists claim Trump is authoritarian, rightists claim ""socialists"" are authoritarian. But neither Sanders nor Trump really pose a threat to our democracy.  Wow.  Way to prove his point. [removed] And there're plenty of people who claim the exact opposite. That doesn't mean they are ""covering up"" anything. Not all that must be said but many are I get downvoted to hell for saying something like that even with my non-mobile account. Btw where do you come from? I am sure every single one of them are. In your mind.  10k+ gun homicides in the USA. Why not ban Guns if you want to ban violence? How many have you talked to or shared a meal with? So I guess we are shoving [Calais Jungle](http://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1315538/huge-mob-of-300-migrants-storm-port-in-calais-in-violent-bid-to-smuggle-their-way-into-uk/amp/?client=safari) and [child brides](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/37518289?client=safari) under the rug huh? Well the good news is that we now have a president and soon to have an AG who will aggressively go after visa overstayers. You should tweet your comment at Trump, just to make sure he knows and will get on that ASAP.   Thanks for the help! But the Mexicans will pay for it. So it's essentially like 99% of of all government business hes right. If we look at the western Roman Empire, the defense of the northern borders was expensive and was a large burden on the economy. The amount of resources spent on trying to properly man the wall is huge, and there is a good chance that it wont work as planned. human enguinity is a bitch. What would be more cost effective is putting the resources into the division charged with executing deportations.  Not to mention that the main factor in the current opiate problem goes back to the pharmaceutical companies. The cartels that traffic drugs aren't forcing anyone to take them, they're feeding an existing market and like with prohibition it won't be starved by constricting the source.  But assuming you have both legalization and the wall at the same time. Many states are legalizing pot now. That would reduce the market for drug trafficking the the wall would increase the hurdle for the drug lords. Man, you got too serious for a second before, making my shitty joke more shitty. Please don't lie.  [**Jordan surrended its claim to the PLO and not Israel in 1988**](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/01/world/hussein-surrenders-claims-west-bank-plo-us-peace-plan-jeopardy-internal-tensions.html)      Thank you. Nah. 2 brothers who've been there (I wasn't infantry).  I see his strong man posturing in the campaign to leave a real missed opportunity in cofunding the wall with Mexico.  There are real economic advantages to both countries and sharing in the expense seems fair.  The character that Trump put forth throughout the election made this impossible. Mexicos border is unchecked going into it. I don't think these things would stop unless Mexico installs a border check point. Haha other than the fact that this almost entirely useless wall will destroy relations with one of Mexico's biggest allies, of course.  The wall will cost a fuck ton to build and maintain, will hurt relations a lot and do incredibly little to stop illegal immigration (most of them overstay visas when coming through by plane)  source on aid cancel? or anything he done about the UN other than a vague tweet about ""he will do it different"" he did nothing that affect israel or jews abroad thats all im saying  >One article called Washington Post columnist Anne Applebaum a political revisionist, noting hell hath no fury like a Polish, Jewish, American elitist scorned. Another called The Weekly Standards Bill Kristol a renegade Jew. I doubt Trump's supporters like immigration of any kind from non-white countries.  Which makes it much worse. The descendants of those who arrived by force complaining about those who arrive peacefully to their country.  Must be that.  ALL OF YOU HAVE TO GO Yeah, Hamas decided to make peace with Israel, and then they [shot 20,000 rockets at Israeli civilians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Israel%E2%80%93Gaza_conflict). Seems about right. Can these people get large things through? Most recent was a couple of weeks ago when a Palestinian rammed his truck into a group of off duty soldiers In Jerusalem. The settlements have gates around most of them with tight security  You seem to have missed the point of my post. It was not that that land is rightfully Mexico.  >Texas, New Mexico, Arizona -- those places are every bit as Mexican as the land on the Israeli side of the wall is Palestinian. What is further than forcing an unconditional surrender of the Mexicans and annexing land that is 100x the size of the entire state of Israel? Why should we cater to them, even if they're just looking for a better standard of living?  > Dude, the mountain is half artificial, the whole compound the mosque is on was built by Jews. People don't really get this, the mountain wasn't big enough for Herods design so they enlarged it, or did you actually think that such a large totally flat and rectangular plaza came into existence naturally.  The question of who made a rectangular structure is not relevant to anything. The resolution was specifically about damage to windows and doors on the mosque and restriction on muslims to the mosque. Read it. It's not talking about who flattened the rectangular area around the mosque.    > Building a religious building over another religions holiest site and then claiming it as your own, even while the very foundations that support your holly site were built by the people you just disenfranchised is a pretty dick move.  The Romans destroyed the temple, not muslims. And this was in ancient times, I can't believe that are really attributing blame to people today for the location of a mosque built in 700 AD. It's not a dick move for them to pray in this mosque in 2017. Jesus fucking christ, it's like I'm talking to someone with an 15th century mentality.    > It does because the resolution addresses only Muslim rights while giving lip service to Jews and Christians at the start, furthermore it never acknowledges any of the sites by any name beside the Muslim one, going so far as putting the wailing wall in quotations and referring to it as the Burak wall (because Muhammad tied his flying horse to that wall if we want to talk about irrelevant beliefs).    The resolution is literally lip service. It didn't do anything, it's just words, so when they talk about Jewish ties to Jerusalem is just as significant as when they talk about Muslim ties to Jerusalem. Calling it by the Arabic term while talking about damages to the physical mosque doesn't mean that they are denying anything about the Jewish connections to the site.  There are restrictions on access all the time for various reasons which can be talked about. If you have a problem with them saying that then talk about that. Don't lie and say that the UN countries like china and Brazil and Mexico and Russia all are antisemetic and said that Jews have no connection to the Temple Mount.  wow interesting. I guess Duterte just really hates Obama  Your correct that the post war period was unique in our economic dominance. Our immigrant roots, freedoms, and  work ethic has made America an uniquely innovative nation. These traits have been with us longer than the post war boom. Although these qualities have been slowly eroded. Not OP but I am pretty sure they have some kind of ground radar that makes tunnels easy to spot.  I've switched sides of the political fence a number of times. The problem is that for most issues there are usually two (or three or more) different sides and rational arguments for both. It seems like mostly our socioeconomic position as well as our background pushes us to one side or the other. Then we get mad because other people have had different (but no less relevant) experiences. There often isn't a right answer. You have to realize the vast majority are in the middle somewhere with you. A lot of conservatives are not racist or bigoted and a lot of liberals aren't afraid of bad words or having different opinions. The two party system has made things too black and white in America.  But executive orders are literally fascism!  -Dems during Trump admin and Repubs during Obama  I'm pro-liberty so I don't vote for the US president because both parties endorse authoritarian ideologies and FPTP election. That was the whole point of my comment.  Postmodernist reductionism is an unhealthy method for big-picture understanding or ethical/moral decisionmaking IMO. ""Globalization"" and ""globalism"" clearly denote different concepts, globalization being a multifaceted phenomenon and globalism being an ideology. Be careful not to discount genuine arguments/perspectives because  a particular word makes you uncomfortable, your intellectual growth is your responsiblility, not mine. Trump just put Bannon on the National Security Council and removed the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. So I'm a little concerned about our democracy. [removed] Exactly what I'm saying. These people ignore the facts and for some reason try to convince others that ""everything is ok"" even though its not. Used to live in Brussels, right now I live in Eastern Europe. I'm just another stranger on the internet - don't take my word for it, but I guess these videos speak for themselves:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0CfOi4tYM  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl16QDk2sig  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO0mGpVPdQs  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozcDOwBY-5Q  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHX5jsomq_U  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2rmA9A7CEM  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D--PagcoO4  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qfTsORJjqI  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6BKXkxvIhY  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sWaBeucCbw  I've got hundreds of those. Tell me when you've had enough  Downvotes. Of course. Hide the truth, it hurts. 100 out of a million has a job. The vast majority very well could meet u/tbhtuvckhnubho understanding. Flase premises got them  into Europe in the first place and the violent crime has only gone up in all Western European countries.  It doesn't take all of them to be horrible. If even 1% are it's enough to cause a hell lot of issues. I have near zero statistical knowledge of how many refugees are pro sharia law, supporters of terrorism, etc, so I can't form a real opinion about it, but the thing that is happening in Europe is definitely not proper.  I believe  screening against violent people/extremists/non-refugees is the way to go, without it an unreasonable amount (if there even is such an amount that is not zero) of the accepting country's citizens will be hurt.  Look at Israel. Palestinians don't have to use guns to hurt women and children, they use knives, cars and trucks. Should they be banned too? Do you mean how many of them tried to rob me, or rounded behind and touched my ex's ass while on public transport when she visited me? (and she's very far from the only girl who I heard her complaining about it)  I don't think you understand the situation. There is no ""talking"" with them. They don't like Europe, they don't like me, you, anyone who is a filthy infidel. For them, we are the lowest of the low. I used to live in a Muslim predominant neighbourhood in Brussels, had a couple of ex-muslim friends and did a fair amount of research on my own.  By the way, ever seen a muslim woman with a non-muslim man? No...but do muslim men go after non-muslim women? All the time..why....? Don't want to ruin the surprise, just do your research - go down the rabbit hole to find out. Start by reading their book - the quran. How about not blowing them out of proportion either? So he proves you wrong and you move the goal posts to an entirely new topic. How cute! Here's the real question, how much money are you willing to spend to solve this 'problem', because the initial cost of a wall isn't the only cost, it's also the maintenance cost. All of the funds going into the wall counts be going into infrastructure maintenance, as well as the wall maintenance costs. > Well the good news is that we now have a president and soon to have an AG who will aggressively go after visa overstayers. You should tweet your comment at Trump, just to make sure he knows and will get on that ASAP.  > Thanks for the help!  That's nice (I can't wait to see the First Lady get deported for overstaying her visa and working without a permit), however that has nothing to do with a wall (or the massive costs and environmental damage associated with said wall). Jesus. Took a look at your history... You are so deluded and misguided that it's a damn shame your actually out there in the real world with all this shit running though your head. What happened to you that made you this way, man? And how do you propose you fund that massive waste of money? Except this isn't 300 AD and you have technology such as motion sensors and cameras that can replace the need for manpower. That's just one type of drug. Reduction of drug trafficking? Maybe, but that doesn't mean the US will stop using them. They will find a way to get it, even if it means growing/making it themselves. Local gangs will increase as they spread out into the drug market across the states.  I'm just surprised it took Israel three wars to figure out that it's easier to defend a river crossing than an open land border. Annexing the west bank makes a lot of sense if you're worried about a fourth arab-israel war. No, when Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, Jordan signed that they have no territorial claims from Israel.  As for Jordan's statement from 1988, Jordan couldn't ""transfer it's claims"" to the land, **20 years after losing the land in a war.** It's beyond absurd. I know they made that proclamation, but it was obviously ridiculous bullshit.  Mexico will never pay for it mostly for historical reasons, and they are a poor country.  USA can afford it, if it stopped warring a few years around the world.  Spend the money on wall, not war. Once a wall is made, it would be easier to stop a lot that now goes in.  Mexico could ask for aid to build all sort of new fangled border checks. It will make it harder for human trafficers using the desert for their criminal antics.  mexico is swarmed by central americans trying to cross  a wall would put a stop to that foot traffic http://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/middle-east/135923-170125-state-department-to-reconsider-decision-to-release-221-million-to-palestinians  The UN thing was an executive order. Ultimately It probably requires congress to act though (which they are already preparing to do).  https://www.breakingisraelnews.com/82677/trump-executive-order-will-defund-un-agencies-recognizing-palestinian-state/   Are you serious? That has been in the news everywhere for days. Actually he made the moronic move of wanting to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The guy writing the ""renegade jew"" article was [Alan Dershowitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Dershowitz), a jewish professor of law at Harvard. Do you actually think he's anti-semitic? They didn't make peace with Israel, they just removed the calls for Israel's destruction from their campaign platform and reduced attacks on Israel in 2005-2006 during the election. I'm just saying that it wasn't the wall.   Also you are talking about the 2014 Gaza war which wasn't some random attack by Hamas. It was after Israel arrested hundreds of Hamas members and then escalated a war in which 2,000 Gazans were killed, including 1,000-1,500 civilians. Hamas killed 70 Israelis in the war, including 6 civilians.  That was in internationally recognised Palestine. Try again. Building a wall through Mexico City. Do you see how generous the Palestinians are? They are willing to let go 80% of historic Palestine. >The question of who made a rectangular structure is not relevant to anything  In your opinion and it's not a question.  >The resolution was specifically about damage to windows and doors on the mosque and restriction on muslims to the mosque. Read it.  Did, restrictions are on men between the ages of 16-50 I believe. The reason this is is because these are the most likely to riot and riots in this case involve throwing stone blocks on Jews praying underneath the compound. That's also why the msque is damaged because once the riot police comes to stop the rioting they barricade themselves in the mosque.  They do this regularly.  >The Romans destroyed the temple, not muslims  Did the Romans force the Muslims to build a mosque on it and ban Jews from even entering the plaza for 1,000 years?  >I can't believe that are really attributing blame to people today for the location of a mosque built in 700 AD  I don't, I blame them for the use of violence in order to prevent other people from worshiping in their holy site. Jews aren't restricted from going on the mount because Jews riot or attack Muslims or damage the structures, it's because the Muslims do that if they are forced to see Jews outside their mosque.  >It's not a dick move for them to pray in this mosque in 2017  Right and Muslims pray there daily.  >Jesus fucking christ, it's like I'm talking to someone with an 15th century mentality.  It's like I'm talking to someone with a 15 year old mentality so I guess we're in comparable situations.  >The resolution is literally lip service.  Yes, it's also insulting towards Jews, it is deliberately worded in order to exclude Jews from any connection to their holy sites.  >It didn't do anything, it's just words, so when they talk about Jewish ties to Jerusalem is just as significant as when they talk about Muslim ties to Jerusalem.   Right and what's your points, did anyone blow a bus because of this resolution? Words and their validity can and should be debated and yes, if you are at the butt end of such a resolution you have the right to complain.  >Calling it by the Arabic term while talking about damages to the physical mosque doesn't mean that they are denying anything about the Jewish connections to the site.  The wailing wall isn't part of the mosque, it's the supporting wall for the structure on which the mosque is built, it also doesn't have doors or windows. If the resolution revolves only around the mosque why does it refer to the area outside the compound in which Jews are allowed to pray? Why is it worded in such a way that it denies Jewish connection to Jewish holy sites?  Given your minuscule understanding of the site I'm guessing you don't know how it looks and what's the nature of the relations regarding the site. Maybe you should educate yourself a bit more before you start talking about something in a land you've never visited. I don't even understand your point. Arabs are now destroying religious sites all over the middle east. Israel is the only country in the middle east where all religions can practice their religion peacefully. And yes all those countries who voted for this are just brown nosing to the Arabs, it is not new, just political interests. Well, the sentiment among normal, sane Trump voters (like it or not, you cant explain away his victory by calling them all ignorant racists) that ""free trade"" agreements like NAFTA, TPP etc. screwed over both average Americans and 3rd world workers for the benefit of multi-national corporations is pretty much spot on. Real, unrestricted, free trade is good for everyone, but the average world citizen has been sold this lie that supra-national entities/treaties like the WTO represents real free trade, when actually they only protect exploitative corporate monopolies.  > I'm pro-liberty so I don't vote for the US president because both parties endorse authoritarian ideologies and FPTP election.  I'm not even an American, but I don't think there are many systems that are less authoritarian than the American one. I think your perception of authoritarianism is very flawed.   >Globalization"" and ""globalism"" clearly denote different concepts, globalization being a multifaceted phenomenon and globalism being an ideology.  Globalism is nothing but a neologism of the word globalization. ""Globalists"" are supposed to be people that believe in globalization. Certain people made in an -ism to make it appear as if it was an ideology and not an independent phenomenon. It's a very new word and in other languages the respective counterpart isn't used at all.     I have looked at a few of these videos. The video titled ""Muslim refugees attack Frenchman"" doesn't show refugees but French youths speaking French, and there's absolutely nothing to indicate that they're Muslim. Seeing that they're black and a lot of migrants in France came from mainly Catholic African countries, they're likely to be Christian or most likely atheists.  Most of those videos are exactly like that, posted by American Trumpets who know nothing about Europe and don't speak any of the languages in the videos. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_crime Granted Europe has a problem but with 112 gun for every 100 people in the U.S. (and a large percentage of these in the hands of lunatics) and the vetting processes already in place do you really think this would happen in the US? If the guy with the bat had come up against an armed american there would have been 7 dead bodies on the ground. What strange form the male impulse to collect has found in you. Que the western european with ""HAHAHA AMERICANS THINK THEY KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR EUROPE""  umm, no. No they don't, they are however, able to look at facts and are capable of pattern recognition.  In the US the only people implementing religious laws over our constitutional separation of church and state are christians.  Read that again. The only people implementing their religious laws over the mandate of our constitution are christians. Why not. I've read it as well as the bible which is full of batshit crazy stuff as well. I can't completely disagree with you and really have no solution. I would fuck the majority off back to where they came from but there has to be a solution. I'm not willing to just use hatred to deal with it. If you can't integrate you can't come here is a start. Nah, I said we didn't want the issues that come with refugees and you just linked me to some random study about crime, which has nothing to do with what I said. So I showed you the issues with refugees that we don't want.  Welcome to the age of weaponized stupidity, man.  He never proved anything. Just posted a random link that had nothing to do with what I said. We don't have the resources to manange camps and any rioting doing by the minority.  High end estimates of the wall are around around $20 billion over 2-3 years it will take to complete and maintenance around $2 billion a year.  In a country with a federal budget of $4 trillion, and a defense budget to $600 billion, I think we can swing it.  Sounds like a job program to me! good point. But, you still have construction, maintenance, and operating costs that are huge. My point is, if you put the billions into the visa enforcement it would do a hell of a lot more than a fence that will stop a fraction of the total illegal immigration into the states.  Yes. Please stop this lying. Since Oslo the ""This is our land the Jordanians gave it us"" argument hasn't been made by any Israeli admin. A good thing that came out of Oslo is that Israel recognized that it was in dispute over the land with the PLO. Only the worst sort of shill makes ""the Jordan gave us the West Bank"" claim. are you for real?  Irregardless of their statements, as long as they support a candidate who does shit like this  http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/jul/05/donald-trumps-star-david-tweet-recap/  and validates the actions racist and anti Semitic groups, and leaves out mentioning the jews on holocaust rememberance day. I can't feel all to comfortable in saying they aren't anti-Semitic. What is he, some kind of self-hating jew? Never heard of something like that before! Actually that was in Jerusalem.  Is there a point to nitpicking about superficial characteristics of the attack, like whether it was in east or west Jerusalem? Regardless of what is internationally recognized Palestine, all of Jerusalem is under Israeli security and administrative control and has checkpoints on entry from the west bank. No worries, these things are never clear in text form. Historic Palestine? What are you talking about? When in history has there been a Palestinian state? I'd love to read about it. I've been to Israel several times and I've been to the occupied Palestinian Territories. I've been to the mosque, and was not allowed in as a Jew during the 2014 Gaza war. I know about this site and it's history. You bring up a whole host of irrelevant points that are attempting to divert from the original claim which is that the UNESCO resolution denies Jewish connection to Jerusalem or the Temple Mount which it does not do. Israel deserves criticism for any violation at the site because it is the one illegally occupying this site. Occupiers have special responsibilities and duties that regular people do not have, and that's why this UNESCO resolution addressed those issues specifically. They did not attempt to comprehensively address every problem that goes on there or decide who has connection to what site.  The UNESCO resolution had nothing to do with what Isis is doing. There are other resolutions that deal with that. The resolution didn't say anything about what 'arabs' are doing and how it compares to what Israel is doing. Frankly you have no clue what you are talking about.  Do you think the average world citizen even remotely understands what that last sentence means? My problem with people's reactions to NAFTA/TPP/Free Trade as a whole is that rather than just taking a step back and realizing this was merely an inevitability of our hyper capitalistic society, cool our jets and elect people who cleverly addressed our issues with income disparity, job creation, automation, and globalization, people decided they needed to burn the whole fucking system to the ground and fire everybody. The reason they thought that is precisely because the average person will never understand this shit and buy into the fear mongering and doomsday rhetoric being fed by lunatic, fringe media outlets who claimed if we don't immediately flip the status quo on its head we would lose the country.  Whatever the fuck that means.    If we really want to make the country exceptional again we're only going to be able to do it through education. People are too fucking stupid to live in this world as complicated as it has become, and we need to stop selling people on the idea that they can be fucking coal miners and prepare them for jobs in tech dominated industries (which is pretty much everything now). Both sides are, in one light, ineffectual/milquetoast and, in another, socially/physically violent and authoritarian. Our entire political dialogue is a debate over which interventionist should be allowed to enact their grand sociocultural scheme on the country, or that is how it is framed at least.   Your citing ""globalism"" as being a term that showed up in the past ~20 years as though that detracts from its weight is mildly comical. Globalism vs. nationalism is not as prominent a debate outside of the US because the US is unique in having a cultural ethos that formed out of Protestant individualism, we have the least authoritarian political ethos in the Western sphere because everyone else is either A.) cultural descendants of monarchic cultures [i.e. all of Europe] or B.) new world nations who were granted sovereignty by the commonwealth through the struggles of global co-operation during the World Wars, [Canada, etc.] Of course all of those places would be bent prostrate toward authority, history has told them it works and humans are utilitarian creatures. I'm an American exceptionalist and I think we're better than that, honestly. We should strive for a better form of government since we just happen to be in a better position than everyone else. No reason to water down what makes America better because eurofags don't think we're authoritarian enough. (pepe.jpg) Funny story - I've been to both Paris and Gaza last year. Couldn't tell the difference.  You need to be both very naive and ignorant to cover up for their actions. It doesn't matter whether they are Catholic Africans or North Pluto Eskimoians - they all have one thing in common. They come from the same pool of shit that is MENA; they cause trouble, don't want to integrate and only leech out money and resources.  ""Most of them"". You took the only video from the list which didn't contain takbir. For the rest - I tell you that FOR A FACT that most of them are muslims. They don't yell ""allahu akbar"" for no reason. Maybe now you'll say that all of them are white males dressed up as arabs trying to false flag the poor muslims? > there would have been 7 dead bodies on the ground  No. There would have been one less terrorist in the world.  And I love the US thanks to your ""gun problem"". I feel much safer knowing that I can protect myself properly in case of an attack.   Disclaimer: Am ex-military.   Stupid cis white males amiright?  223:     Naw.. it's more like American's have been saying and looking on in incredulity that they are willingly importing the social problems they like to make fun of us so much about.  You think it's any different in western EU countries?  Fuck no, I lived there for a few summers - and while that's not enough to get a great view of the culture it was enough to see they ghettoize and marginalize their minorities at a rate not even seen (and likely wouldn't be legal) in the US.  It's just their populations are smaller and it's much easier to keep them sequestered and out of sight/mind in some shitty communist-era looking apartment block 30km out of the city centers with the large social safety nets to (so far) absorb the costs.  Western European cities (well, suburbs) will look like any ghetto American inner city within a generation, perhaps 2.  You will see their police forces becoming armed, and violent crime increasing - but likely not to the levels of the US simply due to less weapons being available.  However you will see more ""low level"" crime instead as it becomes acceptable.  I've also traveled to the countries where some of these people are coming from.  The democracies that allow this are universally laughed at for their utter stupidity, and the general thinking is hey may as well go ride the gravy train and/or go change it politically.  It's just bizzare to me.  Europeans looked at the US and said ""we want some of that!""?  Or were they just so arrogant in their moral superiority they thought they were immune?  It's very confusing. There is the minor issue of many of these people coming from places where they will die if they do not leave. I know some are economic migrants also but unfortunately you simply cant decide to exclude all because some want a job.  Perhaps it's not in our own best interest. That's not the actual point though. That is because the majority is Christian, the only ones able to are Christians, the others have no power. The situation is either Christians implementing religious laws, or no one does.  Of course that has nothing to do with immigration or my comment, so I am not sure why you brought it up. >I would fuck the majority off back to where they came from but there has to be a solution.   First of all, stop them from coming here. Second of all, deport. Third of all, ban. But nobody will do anything because people's ""kindness"" is what keeps the islamic hate machine running.   >If you can't integrate you can't come here is a start.  Of course! Want everyone to be a muslim, can't stand women walking without coverage, want to pray loudly at the middle of the road, ban certain foods, force your own laws? Stay home! If your religion is so peaceful and perfect, and your god is so great - you should have no problems.  Regarding the bible - the amount of crazy jew and christian fanatic terrorists is **so low and insignificant** that this claim is laughable. Nobody takes the bible seriously. The quran is ""perfect"" in the term that it has everything figured out and covered, without any loopholes - there are no ""double meanings"", you have to obey the book **word by word** and you are not allowed to leave the religion. Doing otherwise will get you beheaded/stoned/lashed/thrown off a high altitude (to show that you are nothing). Illegal immigration into just California costs $25 Billion, which is enough to build a wall and have a few billion to spare for operating costs. Now that's just California and not including any other state. If you started to calculate the accumulative cost on crime and policing it, I'm sure you would get a much higher figure. Jordan lost the territory in 1967. They waited **20 years**, and only decided to ""transfer the claim"" when it became obvious they will never get it back.  It makes as much sense as Mexico transferring Texas to the native Americans. Well, with Trump's presidency, there is no telling how relevant Oslo is going to be. Didn't the Palestinians threaten to withdraw their recognition of Israel and officially cancel the Oslo accords if Trump moves the embassy?   If they do that, I dont see why Israel still has to play by Oslo's rules. Justin Trudeau left out Jews in his holocaust speech as well, is he anti-semitic? The point is the wall does nothing because attacks can occur on Israelis who are in front of the wall. >the UNESCO resolution denies Jewish connection to Jerusalem or the Temple Mount which it does not do.  That's because you raised a host of irrelevant claims, I have clearly stated why the resolution does that by not mentioning Jewish connection to any of the sites and only referring to the Jewish name in quotations. You do not accept that as denying Jewish connections to the site, fair enough, that's your prerogative however you have failed to give a counter argument besides ""it's just words"". I'm aware of that, we are after all debating the meaning of words.  If you do not feel like digressing answer this point instead of talking about other, irrelevant to the subject, issues in the resolution.  > Israel deserves criticism for any violation at the site because it is the one illegally occupying this site.  There is no concept in international law of illegal occupation, you are either occupying or not. Israel is currently occupying the area as a result of a war and later an agreement with the former occupier of the territory.  As Israel can be criticized so too are the Muslims in Israels area of control subject to Israeli law and the ramifications of disobeying it. The limitations on access and damage to the mosque are a result of their breach of the law, the only thing here that is actually illegal. Muslims are by far the group with the most rights regarding the temple mount so it seems strange to criticize Israel about Muslim access granted to the site while ignoring the fact that they are granted, by the state of Israel, the most access out of all religious groups.  >Occupiers have special responsibilities and duties that regular people do not have, and that's why this UNESCO resolution addressed those issues specifically.  UNESCO addressed the issue because there was a bloc of countries who wanted to force the issue. The responsibilities of the occupier also include maintaining the law and keeping the public order and safety of civilians, something the violent rioting in Al-Aqsa mosque is in direct contravention of. As long as the measures taken in order to maintain the peace are within reason Israel is within its right to take them and if you son't think the measures on the temple mount are within reason consider the behavior of riot police in other western countries.  > They did not attempt to comprehensively address every problem that goes on there or decide who has connection to what site.  As part of the process of passing a resolution there is negotiation of the exact words of the resolution, the people who made it were fully aware of the meaning of their words since they were informed. In fact this measure was a softened measure of the original because the original was too extreme for the European countries to agree to. When one passes a resolution so devoid of tact and consideration for one sides valid concerns and rights that is sending a message and it is normal that that message be addressed.  That's the problem, they attack Israel with no reason while giving a pass to anybody else. And their resolution was a piece of antisemitic garbage. Anybody who neglect to mention the connection of the Jews to the Temple mount is an hypocrite racist. Really well said.  >Our entire political dialogue is a debate over which interventionist should be allowed to enact their grand sociocultural scheme on the country, or that is how it is framed at least.  That's called politics. You vote for someone to enact your political views. The person/party with the most votes wins. That's democracy. I bet you'd be the first one to complain if people critized your politician for enacting certain policies.   >Globalism vs. nationalism is not as prominent a debate outside of the US because the US is unique in having a cultural ethos that formed out of Protestant individualist  That's bullshit. Not long ago every single member of congress was a ""globalist"". Republicans and Democrats. The whole concept of ""globalism"" and ""nationalism"" - people being oppposed to globalisation - is completely new. Even the meaning of ""nationalism"" shifted. It Europe it's still not used the way it is in the US today. Here it is **not** the opposite of globalisation.   This is Trump's movement. It's new. It also exists in Europe in form of the new populist right (FN, AfD, PVV, FP, LN, UKIP, SD). Your perception of ""American exceptionalism"" is once again more than flawed. There is no tradition of globalisation criticism (of ""globalism"") in the US either.    > Funny story - I've been to both Paris and Gaza last year. Couldn't tell the difference.  Nevermind, there's no point in arguing with you. You are blinded by your hyperbolic fear of Muslims. Disclaimer, so am I what the fuck does that have to do with anything ? So are you european or Israeli? But you can see where I would prioritize my countrymen to foreign economic migrants of predominantly the male gender who hold disturbingly regressive and fundementaly incompatible views, right? Because any mention of islamic sharia law that doesnt also say that indicate that christians are the only ones actually implementing it is silly. Talked and shared a meal with. On reddit muslims are the worst censors ya know. Their actions have taught me plenty about them on reddit alone.  No because the money to deal with that and building refugee camps will be diverted from much need infrastructure among other things. We also don't want these ""tiny"" amounts of bad refugees giving our police more excuses to expand powers. I don't even want people from other states in our cities. Their stupid protests destroyed our town then refused to help the community they protested for.   Keep your refugees. The process to become citizen is just fine. most of the illegal immigrants come from airports and overstayed visa's, not border jumping. If it was the case that border jumping was the biggest form ill egal immigration, then the wall would make more sense. Also, walls don't stop people. if we look at the berlin wall for an example, yes it stopped most of the population. However, people still got through and eventually the wall fell. Human enguinity will always find a way around obstacles, and they will exploit and opportunity. http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2017/01/27/statement-prime-minister-canada-international-holocaust-remembrance-day Yes, since October 2015, there has been an uptick of people using household objects and cars to attack people at random. It is still much better and has produced much less casualties than suicide bombers that were able to freely enter Israel before the wall. At that time, there were hundreds of deaths a year and at times, multiple suicide bombings every day.  Well your entire argument is about your subjective interpretation of what a quotation mark means. You seem to think that it is denigrating or implying a denial, while I and the countries who agreed to the resolution do not see that and just see it as mentioning the other names for the site, with no judgement about who had greater or lesser claim.   The way that Israel conducts this occupation is illegal for a couple reasons.  A) It violates the geneva conventions because there are settlements being contructed across East Jerusalem and the West Bank, which is directly and blatantly illegal. It is obvious to everyone that this is why Israel persists in its occupation. Israel has proposed peace deals in the past that would create a Palestinian state if only the Palestinians agree to give away most of east jerusalem and 9% of the West Bank in exchange for a 1% land swap. So Israel is ready to withdraw if their territorial demands are met. In other words, the occuaption persists due to illegal Israeli settlements which were established and continue to expand in violation of the Fourth Geneva Conventions.   B) Israel illegally annexed East Jerusalem. This doesnt require much expalantion. East Jerusalem is Palestinian according to multiple Security Council resolutions and all mainstream interpretations of international law, and according to every nation in the world (except maybe for the US government for about 1 week now). Ergo the occupation is illegal.   The actions of individuals under illegal israeli colonization and occupation will obviously not recieve the same level of criticism as the illegal and universally condemned occupation that controls them. There is someone to hold the occupied population to account: Israeli security forces. There is nobody to hold Israel, the sovereign power, to account except the international community.  Why wouldn't they talk about Jewish connection to the Temple Mount? What does that have to do with anything? The resolution was not anti-Semitic and any way, this is idiotic.   Nobody condemns Isis at the UN because they aren't even a country and they are being slaughtered by many armies at once. UN resolutions are pointless in that case. Israel is a state engaged in a universally condemned colonization of a foreign territory and nobody is doing anything about it. Cases like this are why the UN was created.
